I wanted to go a little bigger since I have another thicker 8mm tungsten ring that is a size 8, snug fit but a bit tight so I felt I wanna go a little bigger. According to online size guides based on circumference I'm a sz 10. So I figured a size 9 is good. Nope. Too loose. If anything I shoulda stayed at size 8 or went half a size bigger at 8.5, so to sum it all up, if you don't know your size, measure the circumference of your finger, match it with the size guide, and go down 1.5 to 2 sizes down.

I found this ring and ordered it after comparing it to many others. I received the ring very quickly. It was packaged nicely in a small pouch. The ring is shiny and you would never, ever know how little it cost. It looks like I could have spent several hundred dollars on it, at least to my untrained eye. The ring fits perfectly and I was absolutely thrilled to know that it has the slightly rounded \"comfort edge\" so that the ring does not dig into your finger. That had been my only concern about ordering this ring, sight unseen, and I was relieved that it is so comfortable to wear. Honestly, I have worn this ring for probably 2 weeks now and I often forget that I even have it on. It is low-profile so I'm not knocking it into things like I was with my regular set, and I love the look of it on my finger. Great buy!

Being fairly harsh on my wedding bands over my four decades of marriage, I have had some of the best values offered as well as a few irritating wastes of time and money.\n\nAt the price point for this ring, I wasn't expecting much. On receipt and inspection, the fit, finish and quality of this item truly rivals that of rings costing a couple of hundred dollars or more. To the average eye, it is truly indistinguishable from a retail jewelry store piece. Only time will tell if the initial qualities are enduring but after only a few days service, it remains literally as received as to appearance. My last item of this type was a titanium band from a jewelry store costing over six times the price of this yet it was already scuffed in under a week.\n\nFeel confident in buying this ring at this price point. Its visual brilliance and comfortable beveled fit make it a winner. If it remains this way for any reasonable time, I will be purchasing a \"backup\" just in case.

Well, I ordered too big BUT the seller was FANTASTIC and let me exchange the ring for a smaller size when I told them it didn't fit (since you can't resize these). I'm SO happy with my purchase. PLUS it was much cheaper than any jeweler around. So cheap that even if he did somehow lose his ring it wouldn't hurt much to order another one. We are both VERY happy!

The only 'negative' thing is.. It's so shiny/metallic that it outshines my white gold engagement ring, so it stands out if I wear them together.

I am in awe of this ring. Being able to purchase inexpensive quality rings  meant we could get the photographer that we wanted for our very low budget, DIY wedding. So pleased, blessed, and excited.\n\nUpdate: upon closer inspection, the ring has a blemish on it, circular discolored spot that I didn't notice before. I still like the ring and will be keeping it..

I work in construction, and have been notoriously hard on my wedding bands.\n  I started with gold bands, and literally broke a couple of them (and I mean broke, clean through), they were sold for their gold weight. I then went for years without a wedding band (apologies to my wife). Then titanium rings came on the market. I bought one, and pretty much destroyed it in two weeks. It didn't break, but it looked awful. Again I went without for a couple of years. Now  these tungsten carbide rings have come around. After the years that I have spent in construction, I have learned some things about metallurgy, and was intrigued.\nI  thought I would give it a try.\n  Now to the ring.\n  Okay, first of all, this thing is a beast. The first thing you will notice is the weight. It feels substantial (like gold). The next thing you'll notice is the feel, it is smooth!!! This ring has held up to my rough treatment phenomenally well. On close inspection, I can't see a scratch on it.\n  If you live a rough, and active lifestyle, I would highly recommend this ring. One bit of advice, this was the  first comfort fit band  I have  bought, and I think because of the smooth rounded surfaces, it felt loose.  After a couple of tries I  ended up with  a size 11 ring, whereas my previous non-comfort fit ring was a size 12...

These rings are so durable and look so nice, it is hard to believe they are priced so low on Amazon.

After much debating I decided to just get the same one he had but a little smaller, opting for the 4mm.\n\nThis ring fits perfectly and looks great. He has been wearing his for over a year now and there are not any nicks or anything in his ring. Mine also does not have anything wrong with it but I have been wearing it for less than 2 months now. Given that these rings are fairly cheap, I do not worry about losing it or anything happening to it. Also it does not stain the skin like you would normally find in cheap jewelry. We both wear our rings 24/7 they are very comfortable and we don't even notice that we are wearing them. If I happen to lose anymore weight in my fingers I will not hesitate to get another one of these rings in a smaller size. They are great rings to get if you do not have a ton of money to spend or don't want to spend a ton, they are also great if you are not big on wearing much jewelry.", "summary": "Beautiful ring and very comfortable to wear!", "unixReviewTime": 1453161600}

My husband's black tungsten ring is very heavy... But it's a guy's ring so it's bigger. This 4mm band doesn't feel noticeably heavier than a gold or silver band would. The finish is beautiful. I want to say there's a slight almost baby-blue cast to it that's really only apparent under fluorescent light -- but it's NOTHING like the greyer-tinged metals. It's bright. It seems to wear well (just a week, but 24/7 wear) -- no scratches. It's comfortable and not overly domed or overly thick (as in, skin-to-surface, not the 4mm measurement), yet it's substantial. I'm really glad I tried it, instead of continuing to search for the cobalt chrome I wanted.\n\nUpdate, 5+ weeks of constant wear later: The finish on this is outstanding. I've looked at the back part of the bands of all my rings, and basically all of them, gold or silver or stainless or what-have-you, have tiny mars and scratch marks.

I just got it today, and it's absolutely gorgeous. The size was good, although because I have skinny fingers I had to go to my local jeweler to get a small, metal band put inside the ring. It only cost $10, though, so I'm not complaining! The metal looks just like white gold, and it has a very illustrious shine. I was hesitant to get tungsten because of the weight, but I slipped it on my finger and I could hardly tell there was anything there! I tested the durability by slicing it with a knife, and it didn't scratch! Great durability, great appearance, great price.

Well I wasn't going to pay that for the simple fact that if it didn't work out I would be stuck with something I could not wear. That's when I went to my old friends at Amazon.  I found this ring and decided to give it a try. So glad I did. I have had it on since I received it. Even though it is a heavy ring, it is amazingly comfortable. It feels like silk on my finger. ( if that makes sense, lol). So far, I love this ring. I wanted a band that I can wear constantly if I want without having to worry about it scratching or dulling in shine.  And I believe that I have found it. I highly recommend this ring. As far as the size goes, for me, the size 6 is true to size. It fits snug without being real tight. Anything bigger than a 7mm band I would go up 1/2 a size. I am so happy with this ring that I just ordered another one just to have.

Not extremely noticeable, but still a disappointment because now I'm past my return policy and am stuck with it. Luckily it was cheap and I still have time to find a more suitable ring before the wedding. I suppose I can keep this ring to wear when I'm in situations that I don't want to get my next ring lost or harmed.\n\nThe issues continue...

I tried ordering 1 more only to later realize that they didn't come to me from Metals Jewelry, but from \"Gnex\" in China. This 2nd ring was lighter in weight and just felt cheaper all-around. The first ring had a classy \"White Tungsten Carbide\" stamp on the inside... the 2nd ring had a blurry/sloppy \"White Tungsten Ring\" stamped on the inside. Thanks for the permanent reminder that this is a ring, I guess?\n\nI guess I should have paid more attention when I purchased, but it seems strange to me that the products shipped from Metals Jewelry and Gnex are so different, but being sold under the same name. Also, when I ordered from Metals Jewelry I got Prime shipping and free returns; ordering from Gnex meant I had to pay for return shipping and only get a \"partial\" refund. Be careful of that.\n\nSo far it seems like the comparably priced \"Oxford Ivy\" Tungsten rings are a way better bang for the buck and way more consistent in quality.

But I explained to her the material was tungsten carbide, which is one of the hardest ring substances out there, and one of the best priced.

I'm getting married in September so I haven't even worn it yet, other than trying it on to make sure it fits. It's sat in the black \"sack\" that it was shipped to me in. I pulled it out to show a friend recently and noticed that it has some discolorations on it. They're slightly darkened areas that almost resemble burn marks. Not extremely noticeable, but still a disappointment because now I'm past my return policy and am stuck with it. Luckily it was cheap and I still have time to find a more suitable ring before the wedding. I suppose I can keep this ring to wear when I'm in situations that I don't want to get my next ring lost or harmed.\n\nThe issues continue... I decided to try this one more time because I really don't dislike this ring, if only it weren't discolored. I tried ordering 1 more only to later realize that they didn't come to me from Metals Jewelry, but from \"Gnex\" in China. This 2nd ring was lighter in weight and just felt cheaper all-around. The first ring had a classy \"White Tungsten Carbide\" stamp on the inside... the 2nd ring had a blurry/sloppy \"White Tungsten Ring\" stamped on the inside. Thanks for the permanent reminder that this is a ring, I guess?\n\nI guess I should have paid more attention when I purchased, but it seems strange to me that the products shipped from Metals Jewelry and Gnex are so different, but being sold under the same name. Also when I ordered from Metals Jewelry I got Prime shipping and free returns; ordering from Gnex meant I had to pay for return shipping and only get a \"partial\" refund. Be careful of that.\n\nSo far it seems like the comparably priced \"Oxford Ivy\" Tungsten rings are a way better bang for the buck and way more consistent in quality. I'd recommend those instead of this ring.

Reynolds", "reviewText": "If you are looking for a very traditional looking tungsten ring that looks very similar to a white gold wedding band then this is what you need. This has a very high polished look and a solid heavy feel to it. I looked at some of these types of rings in stores and they typically run around $100. I believe that this same exact ring at a retailer would be around that same price. I recommend that you cut out the middleman and save yourself a lot of money. I would say the only drawback is that tungsten is a little bit heavier than the other metals which for some people is a bonus and not a drawback.\n\nIf you have not yet researched tungsten then the main benefits are the price, the extremely scratch resistant nature, and the ability to remove during a emergency because it can shatter relatively easily. The main selling point to me was the very scratch resistant nature. Many other metals scratch fairly easily so they will not look immaculate after months and years of wear.\n\nThe drawbacks to tungsten are the heavier weight, the fact that tungsten rings can shatter if dropped from about 7 feet above the ground onto concrete, and for some people the lack of prestige because it is much cheaper to produce tungsten.", "summary": "if you're looking for a traditional looking white tungsten ring, then this is the one", "unixReviewTime": 1426723200}

We did some research and found that Tungsten was probably going to be the best metal since he is in commercial construction. We went to a bunch of jewelry stores and all their Tungsten rings were thick and fancy. We finally were able to find a thin, shiny band that he loved... super comfortable and everything but it was over $200!!! When we got home I found this ring online and it appeared to be exactly what he wanted but it had to be too good to be true since it was under $25. Based on the reviews, we bought it. We were not let down. It arrived very quickly (the day before expected) and was true to size. We were expecting the ring to be pretty dark because of some of the comments like \"gun metal color\". It really wasn't dark at all and was super shiny. Honestly, I couldn't have told the difference between it and white gold by the color but I'm not a jewelry appraiser. Just out of curiosity we held it side by side to a white gold band and what do you know... slightly darker (and I had to squint to really notice) but that was really splitting hairs. We were thrilled with our purchase and our $175 savings. One small thing is that I wish we would have ordered a slightly thicker band (like a 5mm or 6mm), the 4mm is a tad thin for a man's hand in my personal opinion but my husband was so happy that it didn't really matter to him.", "summary": "Perfect wedding band for somone in commercial construction.", "unixReviewTime": 1426723200}

So when my partner and I decided to tie the knot, the discussion of rings came up and I was resistant.  However, the last time I shopped for a ring, sterling silver was about the only game in town.  This time around titanium was mentioned, and while I liked the description of its very light weight, I was turned off by the complaints everywhere of how easily it scratches.\n\nI reluctantly turned to tungsten, which supposedly didn't scratch but was also very heavy.  We decided on this ring due to several reviewers claiming they forgot they were even wearing it.\n\nThey arrived yesterday and so far I'm pretty happy.  My partner's had to be sent back for being too big, but mine fits fine and I'd say \"true to size\" based on the jeweler's ring sizer I bought off eBay many years ago (sort of an odd tool for someone who hates wearing rings to have, no?)  I love the \"comfort fit,\" which my old silver ring certainly didn't have -- this means a nice rounded edge that feels super smooth going on and off.  And whereas I won't go so far as to say \"I forget I'm even wearing it,\" the weight is there but it's not objectionable.  I typed all day yesterday and it didn't slow me down.  I imagine over time I will eventually stop noticing it altogether.\n\nSome differences from Amazon's photo:  Good:  It doesn't actually say \"white tungsten carbide\" inside, which leaves more room for engraving.  (UPDATE:  The other night I was examining it under a very bright light looking for blemishes (still none).  But I was very astonished to see it DOES have this inscription, but so tiny and faint it's easily missed.)  Bad:  It's not the soft satiny color pictured on my monitor, but rather the more bluish whitish bright color seen on most wedding rings (see photo).\n\nIt's still very pretty though, and feels nice and solid, not cheap at all.  I've got big chunky fingers and usually wear men's sizes, but the 4mm seems perfect and I can't imagine anything larger.  I also can't imagine why anyone would spend hundreds on a ring when this option is available.  I'll update with regards to wear and tear, but so far it seems to be very nice quality for the price.\n\nUPDATE:  It's been a few weeks, and I couldn't be happier I chose tungsten.  I can still feel I'm wearing it, but it's not annoying.  I've been pretty merciless -- I've scraped it on concrete (accidentally), banged it on glass, even changed some oxygen tanks last night at work (lots of metal-on-metal action).  It's still as flawless, spotless and shiny as the day it arrived.  No signs of tarnishing either, which is more than I can say for the sterling silver.  I feel certain a titanium ring would be scratched all to heck by now and look horrible.

My birthday is at the end of this month, January, and I decided that for my birthday, I would order this ring in a 7mm.  I was anticipating a thinner ring when I opened this ring and immediately I was disappointed to see a thick-looking men's ring.  But from past experience with tungsten --- I knew to wear the ring for several days before I evaluated it.  From a \"weightiness\" standpoint there has been much improvement in the newer tungsten rings.  I am able to wear this tungsten ring without any numbing of my little finger or fatigue in my wrist.  However, I take this ring off when I go to bed at night (I wear it on my right hand).\n\nI had a 9mm tungsten ring that I wore for a whole month without taking it off to discover a callus had developed on my finger.  I am now hesitant and cautious about wearing the wider widths (6mm-9mm) for too long of a time.  There is REAL concern for women in buying tungsten rings.  If you are buying for wedding purposes ---- \"go narrow\" would be my best advice.  4mm suits me fine for everyday wear without taking it off.\n\nWhite tungsten (especially with this mirror finish) is God's precious blessing of our age in coming to understand that Jesus wrote the Old Testament.

(However, today I absolutely love it just the way it is:  4mm).\n\nAt first I only wore this ring occasionly but during the holidays, I began wearing it without ever taking it off.

Not only will this ring not scratch, but it is very unlikely to scratch other surfaces with it's smooth finish.  Another benefit of this ring and reason for purchasing a smooth surface ring is that it is much less likely to scratch other things it comes into contact with. My other tungsten carbide ring has a brushed finish and is dull in color. While that other ring is still attractive, it will scratch any painted, leather, or plastic surface that it rubs against. I am very particular about my vehicles so I quit wearing that other ring when I determined a few scratches on my door pillar and wear on my steering wheel were being caused from that \"other\" ring. Since wearing this ring, I have not seen any scratches appear on anything.\n\nI work with my hands constantly while working on industrial equipment. Although I should remove my ring for safety reasons, I don't always remember to so and I am often reminded that I am wearing a ring when I hear metal parts or tools banging or rubbing on my ring. Every time I look to see if it is scratched I am amazed that it is completely flawless. The last incident involved a large rat tail file that was rubbing on my ring while using it. There wasn't a single scratch on the ring!\n\nDid I mention that it looks good too? Perhaps it may be a little too shiny for some guys, but I really like it and it. It reminds me of chrome on my motorcycles. I get a lot of compliments and many people ask me if it's white gold. They are surprised when I tell them it's white tungsten carbide. A lot of people have no idea what that is. There are other rings that claim to be white tungsten carbide but they have a grey tint to them. This one looks like white gold folks! No grey tint to this one and it looks great. When I hold it against my wife's white gold wedding and engagement rings, it matches except mine doesn't have any scratches and won't have to be re-dipped over time. It cost literally fractions of pennies on the dollar as compared to hers.

I also ordered a 5mm version of this band for my fiancee in a size 6.5. The 5mm band was comfort fit, the two 3mm ones were not. The 3mm run small, the 6.5 5mm comfort fit is a little loose on my fiancee's finger but my 3mm size 7 fit him better, so when these rings ship non-comfort fit they probably run almost a full size small. The size 7.5 feels a little more snug than my size 7 engagement ring.\n\nDespite this inconsistency, the rings are gorgeous and mine almost perfectly matches my newly refinished white gold engagement ring. It is only very slightly darker and it is only a noticeable difference upon very close inspection. In my reading, tungsten carbide rings are 4x as hard as titanium so they are very scratch-resistant, which means the beautiful finish lasts a lifetime. Unlike some metal rings, tungsten carbide can be removed at a hospital in case of emergency: they can crush it in a vice and most hospitals carry the equipment necessary to do this. This is just an extra bonus in a wedding ring in my mind.\n\nThese rings are not re-sizeable, but that's okay with me since a gold or white gold band costs around $50 to re-size when you can just order another one of these in a new size for $20.\n\nI am happy with my purchase, I just wish they didn't advertise non-comfort-fit rings as comfort-fit, especially since there are size discrepancies.\nEdit: We have had these rings for several years now and they are as bright and shiny as the day we got them.", "summary": "beautiful finish, run small.", "unixReviewTime": 1410307200}

LEBOLD", "reviewText": "Background:  Prior to buying this White Tungsten Carbide wedding band, I owned a regular gray tungsten carbide wedding band.  For whatever it is worth, I thought that the  regular gray tungsten carbide ring was fine.  However, my wife thought it looked a little too \"industrial\".  Portions of the regular tungsten carbide ring were dark gray, and she said that it was not the prettiest color.\n\nInitial Reaction:  After doing some research, I decided to try one of the new White Tungsten Carbide rings.  All I can say is WOW!  I got the white tungsten carbide ring in the mail today, and it is really VERY nice looking!  It is not \"white\" like a piece of paper.  Rather, it looks very much like a highly polished white gold ring.  It also has a nice heavy weight to it.\n\nHow It Is Made:  Here are the technical facts regarding white tungsten carbide...  The ring is composed primarily of gray tungsten carbide and nickel. A coating (predominantly chromium and a platinum group metal) is applied to the ring using physical vapor deposition. The vapor deposition provides superior adhesion as compared to traditional plating techniques. The white tungsten carbide ring will maintain the brilliant 'white' finish of the coating due to the hard scratch resistant [predominantly] chromium coating and the improved adhesion between the coating and substrate.\n\nBottom line:  This ring has the advantages of a regular tungsten carbide ring, and the look/feel of a white gold ring.  Based on what I have read, white tungsten carbide is not quite as scratch resistant as regular gray tungsten carbide.  However, white tungsten wedding bands are MUCH more scratch-resistant than Titanium, Stainless Steel, or gold wedding bands.\n\nFinal Thoughts:  If there are any problems or issues with this ring, I will provide an update to this review.  In the meantime, I think you will really like it if you are looking for an inexpensive wedding band that is much more durable than a traditional gold ring.  But the usual 'work rules' still apply...  If you are working on heavy equipment or if you are handling strong abrasives like bricks or ceramics, take off your ring!  Better safe than sorry.\n\nUpdate:  After owning & wearing this ring for almost two years, it is still 100% scratch free and the color/finish still looks perfect.", "summary": "This is the Ring to Buy!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1399593600}

However, after a week and a half of constant wear (I kept it on while washing hands, but took it off to shower, use hand sanitizer, wash dishes, etc), the gold plating has worn off to show a deeper copper color. (In my opinion, not as pretty as the original paler pink color, but also not horrifically ugly.) I know that plating wears off (my white gold jewelry turns yellow over time) and that jewelry reacts to the chemicals in your skin, but I didn't expect this to happen after only a week of wear!\n\nI wore this along side a 10k rose gold band, and by the end of the week the color distortion was highly noticeable, especially in sunlight. On the flip side, at the end of the week, the 10k band had noticeable scratches, whereas this ring still looked brand new. (Well, besides the coloring.)\n\nI think I may order the \"white tungsten carbide\" version and see if that holds up any better. Obviously the ring itself is of reasonable quality, so it may just be that whatever chemical is used in the rose gold plating doesn't work with my body chemistry.\n\nPictures, for color comparison. The one with three rings are (left to right) 18k white gold, this ring, 10k rose gold. The one with four rings are 18k white gold, 14k rose gold, this ring, 14k yellow gold.

I found them on here and really liked the design.  I always have to be careful because some earrings will cause my lobe to swell, turn red, and itch. I decided I would order and give them a chance.\n  I am a dental hygienist and generally I don't like to spend alot on earrings for work as I have a tendency for them to get lost while I'm working.  I take my mask on and off all day and sometimes the earrings get caught on my earloops and they get lost. I liked this design specifically for the fact that the post attaches to the rest of the earring and isn't just a post and back. This will lessen the chance of me getting it hooked on my mask and losing the earring.\n  I really like the fact that these are really sparkly when you wear them and they appear to be well made and durable. I've been wearing them a few weeks and I still have not lost them so that is an awesome sign that I will have this set a while. In the time I have work these, I have had no redness, itching, or swelling of my ear lobes. They have not tarnished nor have they turned my skin green. They are just as shiny as the day I have received them in the mail.  It also helps that I have cleaned them in the jewelry cleaning chemicals and that hasn't damaged the earrings either.\n  The earrings themselves are about 2cm in diameter and a half a cm in width. So they aren't humongous or gaudy, just classy. You can get them in three colors, gold, rose gold, and silver.  The pair I purchased were in silver and I'm going to get my sister a pair in rose gold since her favorite is in rose gold.  They make a great gift because they don't tarnish, don't turn the skin green, and she has sensitive ears as well and I feel confident enough that issues won't occur as I've been wearing them for weeks with no issues. If you don't like these earrings then they have a money back guarantee.  I did purchase these at a discount and this is my honest opinion that is not at all swayed by the fact I had a discount at checkout.\n  In conclusion, I would recommend these for yourself or a gift as these are well made and durable, classy looking and not gaudy, clean up nicely, and I haven't had any issues with irritation.  Just a pretty pair of earrings that look good with any outfit and would make a great gift idea. Even at full price these are a good deal.", "summary": "Classy earrings that sparkle.

I'm usually an 8 or a 10 so I got \"medium.\"  They are extremely snug, can barely get them up, and if they shrink at all, they wouldn't fit, so I reordered a \"large,\" received today.  (I'm 5'8\" and 145, slim hips.) Since these are boyfriend style and not supposed to be figure-hugging, I think the larger size is better and there is allowance for a little shrinkage.  The waist is very roomy, but the hidden drawstring takes care of that issue. I may replace it with elastic to make things easier.  I wish these came up a bit higher on the waist, but other than that, I like them.\nUPDATE  Now that I've had the large size awhile, here are my thoughts. The rise in these jeans is too short, so it's good that the large comes up a little higher. I put elastic in the waist band tunnel so I wouldn't have to tie a drawstring. The large was really too roomy and baggy, so I took a few inches out of each leg, on the outer seam.  I'm sure the medium is really my size, but because of the low rise they didn't work. I like them a lot now, and have two (altered) pair which I wear all the time. To the Pajama Jeans company: Make these higher rise.  Make the mediums a tad bit larger. Do away with the \"whiskering\" look.  Make the waist a little smaller, and consider elastic. Then they would be close to perfect.", "summary": "Fit small", "unixReviewTime": 1455580800}

Use cold water only and let them either air dry or dry on a very low cycle. I have not had any problems with sizing or shrinkage.  I am a curved size 14 and these are flattering.

I did a bunch of internet research and generally found that people who actually tried out a pair of the jeans for the most part liked them. If they didn't like them it's because they didn't like the fit. People who overall didn't like the concept were making fun of the infomercials but hadn't actually tried the product. So I decided to give it a shot. I am pear shaped and put my weight in my hips and legs, so I went for the ONE non-skinny jean option they offered. As soon as my little package arrived, I pulled out my jeans, and I was amazed at how soft they were. I tried them on and they fit me perfectly. Things tend to be too narrow in the thigh for me, and any plus sized item is guaranteed to be way to big in the waist and the rise. I ordered the 1x based on my measurements and the size chart on the PajamaJeans website - 38\" waist, 50\" hips, expecting the waist to be a little big. The fit was as expected, nice and loose in the thigh area, they hug my butt without squeezing it, and I can cinch in the waist without it looking like a paper bag. I really like the waist cinch, it's a flat cord that when tied in a bow lies flat. The fabric is pretty thin so I don't see these working for colder climates unless you wear long underwear underneath. I really like the cropped length and the overall color is really fun.\n\nBut do they look like jeans? yes, for the most part, they do. If you look close you can see the texture of the knit fabric, but from any normal distance, it just looks like a normal jeans wash.\n\nSo why only four stars? Mainly the color. There is this striping in the pocket area that is really only flattering if you have no hip definition and trying to create some. If you, however, have hips, the last thing you want is to draw attention to them. I'm hoping this fades in time. It's not a deal breaker for me.\n\nI only have 2 suggestions, 1) the inner cord should be elastic so I can take the jeans off without untying it, and 2) fix the striping on the hips so it's more flattering for wider hipped women.\n\nFinally, I really wish they'd make more relaxed fit styles like this in a variety of washes. I just don't like wearing \"fitted in the hip and thighs\" types of jeans for my figure.", "summary": "Live up to their promise!", "unixReviewTime": 1446768000}

I found myself naturally reaching for pockets that are not there so that was a tad annoying but can easily adjust to. I've had troubles with the zip style in the past where the raised collar hits me in the chin whenever I look to the side. This jacket did not have that issue as the sides of the collar sit relatively flat.\n\nI ended up having to return and exchange for a L as I have long arms and the sleeves were a tad too short.

I found this great jacket on Amazon kinda by accident,  I was just browsing the isles looking for some new shorts when this popped up on my screen and it was love, and the color was great.  The best part of it was Amazon promised me I would get my order today and low and behold it was there.  An order meant to be!  Seriously,  My new Terry cloth jacket is really nice. It is 100% cotton, and that  makes it feel nice to wear as well as looks good.  My only negative and it's a minor one, is that it is a snug fit, I ordered a size larger than I normally wear and it is just right.

I was skeptical, but tried on a pair. W/O their initial email I never would not have tried them on and they ARE comfortable!\n\nNot only did they actually FIT, they do not hurt my feet or make my ankles swell.

And it's the blue one. However, the blue is a darker color and appears to be more royal blue than sky blue. I'm not complaining about the color swap however because this blue is much more appealing in my opinion. I purchased from LovelyPet and felt like the package took forever to get here. But in fact it wasn't their fought and  it was the shipping companies'. They were very nice to work with because I just filed a complaint and they emailed me right away! And than it came 2 days later!!!! I mean wow, they offer truly awesome service. Now for the actual product? It's super chic. And I LOVE it... my bad I HEART it!!!! Haha, lame puns aside...it is a very decent necklace for the cheap and affordable price. However my Mom won't accept it as a late Christmas gift and had said \"It looks like something you would wear so why don't you keep it, sweetie?\" So what do I know about chic!!!??? Hahah. But hey guess what-More for me than! Or however the saying goes. Awesome product.. little iffy on the shipping but it all worked out great. Will buy from LovelyPet again solely on their amazing customer service. That's all. I'll add a pic so you can see the color better. Overall I am a happy camper! =D UPDATE: YO LISTEN UP!

It arrived with the bag torn and the hat crushed and bent.  The material is easily reshaped, but the dents in the top portion in the hat will never completely come out right.  Also, the hat is small for me, and most \"one size fits all\" hats normally fit me just fine.  Also, the hat is not \"floppy\" as it is described.  The material is fairly stiff.  The hat does look good and in its somewhat beat up condition, it is perfect for my costume.  But if you are looking for a fashion hat to wear,  this hat probably wouldn't work for you since it isn't mailed in a box to protect it.  I imagine that every hat that they send out arrives in a similar state as mine did.  If you are looking for a good looking hat to go with your costume, and don't mind that it arrives flattened, this is a good deal.  The hat look good and the price is right.\n\n*Update: I received an email from Elenker shortly after posting this review.  They apologized for the crushed condition my hat arrived in and offered me a full refund as well as saying that they would recommend a change on how this hat is packaged for mailing.  I declined the refund since I do intend to use this hat as part of my Halloween costume and I wouldn't feel right taking a refund on a product that I am using. However, the fact that Elenker contacted me right away and offered a refund is a big plus for me, so I am bumping this hat up one star because the company is responsive to their customers needs.

The product came in the mail in a fast efficient time, it was actually a lot sooner than expected. Upon opening I loved how each size tapers were in their own little bags with the size labeled clearly, that made it easier to find the correct size I needed. I went with a 12g but before putting it in my ear, since seeing the reviews of making sure to clean them well, I put them in a little container with dawn dish soap and let them soak a few minutes and then I went ahead and used a small gauze pad to clean it and rinse it off. I put it in my ear incorrectly at first just to see how it would do and the stretching felt like a slight pinch but nothing worse. I decided to only do one ear because of the fear of infection and once I turned it around I was not extremely comfortable with how it felt sitting on my neck and the way it felt when i would move my head around so I did take it back out. I had no issues with infection and pain, i was just not comfortable as a personal decision. This Product is wonderful and I highly recommend it as well as highly recommend a thorough cleaning before use. The seller was very polite as well!

So again this is a good set for the price just please be careful with what you try to put into your lobes when using these to stretch. I would almost say they are each a size smaller than what they are suppose to be. But again I don't feel like it's a whole size smaller but 100% they are in between sizes from orginal all tapers I have from 14g-6g and my 00g none of these are the exact size as the ones I have owned for 10 years I bought all my original tapers from hot topic and Spencers gifts so that's the only reference in size I can go by so maybe hot topic and Spencers gifts runs big but I feel like it's this set that runs a bit small rather than 2 stores and 3 different brands of tapers and plugs that run big. So just use your brain don't force plugs that won't go in with ease into your lobes and buy a set of 00g tapers or what ever size you are planning to stop at and use those before trying to get those awesome new plugs you just bought into your ears.. take it from me infections suck bad! I just went through it and it was an awful couple of weeks on and off antibiotics and back and forth to the drs. So smart and happy stretching folks! Below is a photo of the 00g from this set and a 00g taper I bought at hot topic (morbid metals brand)", "summary": "decent set but slightly off in sizing.", "unixReviewTime": 1440374400}

Overall, I've been very satisfied with the ring and the sizing was spot on. Some things to point out, though. First off, I wanted beveled sides and this delivered. Another reason I chose this over other black tungsten rings, was because apparently black is ceramic's natural color, whereas black tungsten is black metal injected into it to make it black. It has a higher probability of showing wear and scratches because it's no it's natural color and  I'd have to say I like the natural gunmetal black color much better than just plain black.\n\nSomething that might throw some off, though, is the shininess of the ring. I half expected the wood part to be more of a semi gloss finish, but this ring shines all the way around. In the sunlight, the wood grain looks the best and really stands out and has a neat color to it; however, in lower light or indoor light, it's much harder to really see the wood grain style through the shininess of the ring. I don't mind it, but you might.\n\nOne last thing, this is my first experience with ceramic rings as my last was tungsten. I really got used to the weightiness of the tungsten and made me feel a little better knowing it was a heavier piece of metal. This ring is complete opposite in weight compared to my tungsten. Feels like a feather. It's something I grew accustomed to very quickly, but did not like at first. Ceramic is still almost as tough as tungsten, but if you like a weighted feeling ring, I don't suggest ceramic.\n\nAll in all, you're not spending that much on the ring so, if you've got a problem with it, there's a million other rings out there. I couldn't have asked for much more. I love it cause it suits my personality and my wife loves it, too. That's what really counts, anyway, right?!", "summary": "Love the color, little too shiny, very light", "unixReviewTime": 1440720000}

I have laced my shoes every which way. CEP knee-high compression socks helped my shin splints when they were bad, and delayed the numbness onset for a few more miles, but they were never tight enough in my foot. I had to wear a size 4 because of my massive calves, but my feet are tiny, so nothing was tight enough and kids' socks were complete crap that caused blisters. Finally I asked for a few pairs of these for Christmas and by December 26, my sock game had completely changed. I ran 6 miles with no numbness whatsoever. These socks allow me to tie my shoes a little tighter so my ankles have more support without my feet aching and going numb. I now need to order more pairs so that I can wear them every run (4-5 days a week) and even for elliptical workouts. I wear a size 2 in these and wish they would make a size 1 because they are still slightly loose, but hoping a couple dryer cycles will tighten them up a bit. I would not worry about your ankle circumference when ordering these, as you can add a slit to loosen the ankles but you definitely want them snug on your feet.", "summary": "Completely eliminated my foot numbness", "unixReviewTime": 1482969600}

Both halves have Mother on one side and Daughter on the other, which I LOVE.  It's very pretty to start and looks just like the picture.  It's also a good size for the rest of my charms.\n\nThere are a few flaws, however.  One such flaw is that it is VERY top-heavy.  The only way to wear it is upside down.  I'm thinking of getting one of the rubber spacer things to see if that will fit and make it stay upright.  Also, I ordered the dark red (garnet), but it looks like a slightly-off red.  It's super similar to the other red charms I have.  Finally, the gold coating has work off already.  I've had this charm for 4 days, and the only gold left is on the top and bottom of the body.  Perfect?  Certainly not.  Worth the price?  Yes.\n\nEdit: The silver coating is now wearing off as well.  It looks very cheap.  If you get this set, coat it with a clear nail polish first.", "summary": "Not Perfect, but Worth the $$$", "unixReviewTime": 1442793600}

I have never received anything for free or at a discount through Amazon and not interested in doing so. So this is an objective review. The ratings are all over the place on these but I will give it a 5 star for how well they accomplish the limited role they are filling. Sometimes people compare apples to oranges (or these to regular readers), and that misses the purpose target. So here is my take: in the last year (mid-forties so beat the 40 year average:-) ) I noticed what had been perfect vision was not so perfect for close up reading. The problem for me is I have never worn corrective glasses in my life so I have not had to remember glasses every day. If my experience with sun glasses is an indication of how I would deal with reading glasses then I needed something I would not forget and I would not sit on and crush a week or two after the purchase. These are perfect for me! As far as functionality they actually work very well for my needs. I have a wide bridge and they sit on it without issue and hold their place and do not cause discomfort. I did have to find the sweet spot on my nose to set them where it is a good mix of comfort and clarity. My reading vision with these is as clear as any Foster Grants I have tried. I stuck them on back of my phone like in all the pictures and that works very well. I do not forget my phone! It messes a little with the NFC when using Android Pay at register CC terminal but if you just flip the phone over and touch screen side to the terminal it works fine. That may just be a week CC terminal at Walgreens also, that is the only place I have tried it so far. Overall it does its job and IMO it does it VERY WELL! They are not for every face and nose out there. They should not be compared to normal over the ears glasses. They are a convenience tool. I can say they work well enough and are comfortable enough that I often choose them even when I have a normal pair of Foster Grants available. So that says something about function. Not sure about looks but that is hardly important anyway when you only use them for reading.\n\nBTW, there is a free lifetime replacement if they ever break. They say send them and they will send out a new pair ASAP.  Being only $20-ish I am not sure it is worth the effort but for some it will be. I wish these were available in stores like Walgreens but I have not seen them but then I have not really tried. They may have info on their website if they are in stores so you can go someplace and try them out first. Being Amazon you can always return them for full refund anyway.\n\n-Cheers!", "summary": "They do exactly what they are intended to do IMO.

I wore on eon one day and this one the next.  I am a huge fan of the color purple and I really dig the vintage vibe this shirt has.  It is incredibly soft and has become one of my favorite shirts to wear.  It fit perfectly and as expected.  I recommend this shirt for all Star Wars fans and those who just want a cute a comfy tee shirt.\n\nI purchase lots of items through Amazon, some I get for free, some I get at a discounted rate, and most I pay full price. I will always disclose if I receive an item for free or a discounted rate. I do a lot of reviews so here is a break down on how I determine my star rating of a product:\n\n5 stars  I love it! It is awesome and I highly recommend everyone to purchase this product!\n4 stars  I like it, but there are some flaws. Don't we all have flaws? I would purchase again.\n3 stars - It was okay, but I would probably not buy it again unless there are no other options.\n2 stars  There may be worse products out there, but you can definitely find better choices.\n1 star  I dislike the product, I wish I had not purchased it and recommend others to not purchase.\n\nIf my review was helpful please click the yes button below. Thank you!", "summary": "Cute and Comfy", "unixReviewTime": 1467849600}

Fits my 20mm Timex Weekender well. I have three of these in white, black, and blue (Love them!

Unlike the light brown noted by one reviewer as lighter than shown, the dark brown is true to the images. Also, as other reviewers notes, the leather is a bit thin, but not bad, esp. for the price compared to other leather bands. Probably wouldn't last too long under tough conditions (wouldn't get it wet, for example). However, if, like me, you plan to change it out and use it along with other bands, it should fine in that way. Like another buyer, I have a big wrist and the fit is very good w/lots of holes to adjust sizing. Since it didn't cost a mint and shipping was free, I can get another when this one wears out.

They offered to send a replacement and it's on its way.  They also personally checked the one they are sending.  What is lacking in QC is looking like it will be made up for in customer service!

I like the color (red) it was my favorite out of the choices of different fashion jewelry sets from AmaziPro8. I wish the chain were a little longer but I can easily exchange it with another one of my necklaces and still wear the pendant. (I just prefer longer chains)..\n\nThe pendant itself is pretty, reminds me of a ruby *my birthstone*! The silver decoration is a great compliment to the color coming from the pendant  and makes the necklace look very elegant. I had no problems with the pendant flipping over like some necklaces tend to do while wearing them. The pendant stays flat and stands out, always catching the light and sparkling. The way the pendant is cut the light is able to catch it from so many different angles, grabbing attention most of the time. I have already had compliments while wearing the necklace..so it is very noticeable.\n\nThe set has a headphone dust plug that is great for covering the unused cellphone headphone jack. It has a notch that really holds the plug in the phone nicely. I have not had it drop out once, this is great! Keeps dust out of my phone and also adds a bit of sparkle *bling* to my cellphone! I was provided a discounted sample for evaluation and review.", "summary": "Bling Necklace, and Cellphone dust plug! Catches the light, attention grabber!", "unixReviewTime": 1426118400}
