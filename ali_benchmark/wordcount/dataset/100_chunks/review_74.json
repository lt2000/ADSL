They are nice for the price. I have 3 piercings on the lobe of each of my ears and I wear the first 3 smaller sizes on each ear. I think I normally would have given 4 stars, but the price is really amazing for what you get. Here are my thoughts:\n\nPros:\n+ 6 very different sizes are versatile - it's nice to have so many options.\n+ Very comfortable for everyday wear, especially for leaving in while sleeping (my main reason for choosing these)\n+ Very stylish! I like how bold they look. Maybe people will think I'm cool now!\n+ Good quality - I've been sleeping, showering, running, skating, and working out with these in for the past couple weeks and they have not loosened nor fallen out.\n\nCons:\n+ Not the GREATEST quality, but like I said the price is unbeatable. They have the screw threading on the outside, meaning the threading goes through and touches the piercing hole, which is technically not as sanitary as something you'd usually get for professional piercing jewelry. If you're taking these off and on a lot, frequently pushing the threading through your ear isn't recommended. I plan to leave these in for long periods of time, so these work well for me.\n+ I saw another reviewer mention this as well - the posts are a tad thick, so they were a bit tight to get in the first time. I worked them in slowly and was patient.", "summary": "Nice for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1531958400}

This dress is beautiful! I tried the same one on in champagne in a bridal boutique that was priced over $2,000. I loved the dress but had been browsing through amazon as well and knew that it would be worth a try to save some money. Man am I glad I did!\n\n I had it express shipped and it came in about 2-3 weeks. It was inside out, wrapped in a bag that was tapped and in the DHL bag. It felt like Christmas unwrapping it :) I also had ordered a dress from a different seller on amazon that was custom made to my measurements that was in tulle. It was pretty but you could see how that customization wasn't as nice as this seller. I would have had to add a petticoat for that dress too... This one had everything that was already sown in and ready to go, even a elastic bra strap in the back inside of the dress for a bit of support and to hold the dress to your body. I ordered the ivory and it's just beautiful. It is a lighter ivory then what I had tried on in the stores but I am glad it wasn't as dark.. the dress looks white but not bright stark white on light skin.\n\nMy mother, sisters and aunts were blown away with this dress, and shocked when I told them where I got it and how much I paid. I will post pictures after my wedding... my fiance is trying to catch a peek before the wedding and I will not let him :) I showed him pictures of about 20 dresses and this is the one he said \"omg that's it, it's perfect\" to. I can't wait to show him the real one!\n\nMy measurements are super hard to find anything that will fit. I have a 10 inch difference in my bust and waist so anything I bought was going to have to be customized or altered, by far this dress was more then I was barging for.\n\nI highly suggest this dress and the dress maker!", "summary": "Amazing dress!!!

I ordered the pink one (pictured as a bright pastel), but what I received was more of a mauve or dusty pink--much darker than what I'd expected and not in my color wheel.  The fit was a bit disappointing, too, as it ran at least one full size too small.  Be aware that this hoodie is not made of typical sweatshirt material.  It's a thinner fabric (but not sheer); more like a high quality, reinforced t-shirt material.  It is not bulky and does retain body heat well for a fabric that isn't fleece. There is a outer seam that runs down the length of each sleeve, and and my shirt arrived with a lot of loose threads exposed on one sleeve.

I am not that picky when i comes to hand bags. I do like the look and design of designer bags, but if i can find a great purse for half the price, i am going to get that instead. I am not brand loyal. I've had these for about 3 weeks now, and i am very impressed. I wanted to make sure i gave ample time in reviewing this set of purses to make sure they stand up to everyday use.\n\nThis set, you receive 2 different handbags, 1 chain bag, 1 wallet, and 2 small bags that can be used for make up or keeping important things in. I love how you can have a purse for each occasion. The material of the bags is a bit delicate, but that doesn't really bother me. I really love the wallet. I am always looking for a good wallet. I have many pro beauty industry cards, and a regular wallet can fill up fast. I love how both sides of the wallet have plenty of card slots and and a sipper to keep change in. I also love the medium size hand bag. It is perfect for everyday use, has plenty of room, and since it is black, it can go with any outfit and it will totally look cute. The chain purse is small, but it is great for a nice night out like going on a date, or to a fancy dinner. It looks great with a multitude of dresses and and the chain gives it a little extra sassiness to it.\n\nOverall i am very impressed with the set. I love how there is a purse for any occasion. I highly recommend this set to anyone. If you love purses and are not picky, this set it for you. You will not be disappointed. I received this for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "This is a wonderful set of purses", "unixReviewTime": 1463788800}

Since this dress does not have size 0/2, I went for a 4/6.\n\nThe dress is beautiful! If you are afraid that the material will look or feel cheap, do not worry; it is comfortable and acceptable quality. The finishing of the details is not perfect, but this is expected at this price point.\n\nThe only thing we did not like so much is that the dress does not fully adapts to her figure well in the back. I wish they would have a 0/2 to compare and see if this slight misshape is because of being too large or because of the dress design in itself. I think if you are a slightly taller/heavier than my wife, the 4/6 will fit you perfectly\n\nOverall, a great gift and a new pretty dress for my wife's summer collection!", "summary": "Great summer dress at a very affordable price", "unixReviewTime": 1456876800}

It's super sexy and attractive. I ordered size small because I am petite. 4\"11 height and 90lbs weight. The dress fits me perfectly,it's not too loose or too tight and not too long or not too short. It's exactly what I want it to be,very comfortable for me to wear. I like how the dress is made and the style is design to make women feel beautiful about their selves. I like how it hugs and fit my curve. I can wear it for social gathering or going to a party,wedding or prom. I like the material, it is made of polyester and spandex but mostly polyester,if it's all cotton I could have given it a five star. You have to pay close attention to the sizing though because it might not be the usual size you normally wear but mine fits my small body. The back part is kind of see through and the halter has snap which easily holds your back. I like how the white and black stripe is design,very artistic.

While it does not advertise as being water resistant, the material that it is made out of does a pretty good job of keeping whatever is inside dry. Now do not get me wrong, this will not protect your stuff if you are hanging outside in a big downpour, but it will keep your stuff dry during your walk from your car to your nearby destination. Continuing with the exterior, both the shoulder straps as well as the back of the backpack contain some kind of cushioning for an overall more comfortable experience.\n\nThis backpack has a total of three zippered pockets, two of which are located on the outside of the bag. The third one is a small pocket that is located on the inside of the largest pocket. You can only store smaller things in it like a handful of pencils or markers, or maybe a phone or a pair of sunglasses. Also inside the largest pocket is a padded compartment to house your laptop inside of. My only gripe with this backpack is that the padding is not tall enough and thus leaves a little bit too much of the laptop exposed for my liking. Inside the smaller external pocket is two pen/pencil slots, as well as a calculator pocket.\n\nAll in all I have been quite pleased with the quality of this backpack. It is stylish, it is comfortable, it is durable, and it even has two easily accessible external mesh pockets to hold your drink and your snack.\n\nNote: I purchased this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review, and this IS my honest and unbiased thoughts on this product.", "summary": "Sporty and padded for comfort.", "unixReviewTime": 1454457600}

I did not see any flaws on the stitching  and there is no any distinctive smell. The fabric that they use in this bag is light in weight and does not give scratches or stains on my clothes. Scratches and stains are common on crossbody bags depends on what kind of material they use on the product. It has 2 zipper pockets in the front and 1 at the back. The zippers work fine and looks not poorly done or poorly made. The straps are sturdy, durable and they are adjustable. It does not irritate my shoulder or neck everytime it rubs. But it may give you sore from having too much fiction especially when you are out and it is hot outside and you wear no sleeves. I always use this bag everytime I go out for a walk or a quick trip to a store with my toddler. I can put her baby wipes, tissues,and her snacks inside aside from my phones, keys, and sunglasses.\n\nI love this crossbody bag because I am hands free especially when I am with my toddler. I like the color shade of the bag too. I just don't like the brand name to be put be like that but I am happy with my experience and very satisfied with the quality of how it was made.

Keep my stuff safe when I was caught in a rainstorm.\n\nAdjustable straps so you can wear it crossbow or on one shoulder.\n\nMany pockets for organization.

Still pretty puzzled about the sizing though. I looked at the chart and I still can't seem to wrap my head around the measurements that they provide. I'm about 5'7\" and weigh about 150 lbs with an athletic build. I normally purchase US small coats (North Face, Kuhl, Eddie Bauer, etc). Based on other's reviews, the sizing chart and my other coats I figured the US Medium would be the right size. Unfortunately the shoulders are too snug, chest too tight when the coat is zipped, and even the sleeves are too short. Very puzzling. The label on the coat says XL but when I ordered on Amazon the drop down menu said US Medium/Asia XL. I've ordered the US Large/Asia 4XL (since there seems to be no US Medium+ any longer) and will update my review when I receive the larger size.\n\n*** UPDATE - so after posting this review I looked at my order from Amazon and confirmed that I ordered the US Medium/Asia XL however on the review page it says US XS/Asia XL. I am really puzzled right now and can't tell if they sent me the wrong size (US XS instead of US Medium)! I hope they can get the kinks out of the ordering and sizing. I may have to cancel the US Large I ordered since I really have no idea what they sent!!!\n\n*** UPDATE 2 - after communicating with the seller (who responded very quickly) I received a refund and proper size information. The sizing on the Amazon order drop down menu is accurate now and for my size the US S/Asia 2XL is correct. Unfortunately they did not have the black available on Amazon Prime so I ordered a green and have been very happy with the purchase and sizing. The shoulders are only very slightly tight, although I do have broad shoulders, but not really noticeable.

I've noticed that's very hard to find. I bought one with those stats at Wilson's Leather 5 years ago and it lasted for a couple years before the suuuuuuper thin leather started peeling apart, and the super thin lining on the inside started tearing. Took me 3 years to find an acceptable replacement at Kohl's. That one lasted 2 MONTHS before it started falling apart at a very rapid rate.\n\nI scoured Amazon for HOURS looking for an affordable, small, durable, black, leather, crossbody purse. Due to the price of this purse, I was suspicious. Everything else like it seemed to be $150+! After much contemplation, I decided to give it a try.\n\nOH MY GOSH ITS EVERYTHING I WANTED AND MORE!!! It's small. The leather seems thick, so it feels like it should last for a loooooong time. If my super flimsy Wilson's Leather one lasted 5 years, this one should last 30. My #1 pet peeve in purses is the inner lining that always tears apart so easily. This purse has a super thick, mega durable cloth lining. I swear this lining will NEVER tear or fall apart! Then we get to the pockets. THERES SO MANY POCKETS! I love it! Everything I carry with me has it's perfect little space. I wondered what in the world I would do with the two tiny pockets in the front. What could they be good for?!

I am proud of her for that.\n* I have raised several children of my own, Potty Trained Them, and potty trained several grandchildren.\n* Be prepared. There will come a time when you will need to dump these into the toilet. Then rinse the pants in the toilet.  Then, scrub with some laundry detergent and stick into a bowl to soak them.\n* Its not a big deal when you get the hang of it. It is easy as changing a diaper.

Fortunately they have addressed this issue and I can say I've had many compliments on the style of this shoe. The comfort is still top notch making this model a great all-day walking shoe. There could be a bit more arch support, but these have more than most comparable fashionable sneakers, which usually tend to sacrifice comfort for style. I walk to work every day in New York and these are now my go-to pair of shoes for fair weather. The suede is obviously not ideal for rain or snow, but the few times I have been caught in the rain in these my feet did not get wet, although the shoes did absorb quite a bit of water. Despite what a few other reviewers have said, my feet never overheat in these, even during the hot and humid NYC summers. They are definitely warm, but not uncomfortably so. I expect these will continue to be very cozy when the cooler autumn weather hits.\n\nSo far the build quality seems high, with stitching around the entire sole which should increase the lifespan of the shoe and prevent the sole separating from the shoe. The sole is thick and I expect will last quite a while. The white rubber picks up dirt and is nearly impossible to keep in pristine condition, but I personally think that this adds character to the look of the shoes.\n\nOverall I am happy with my purchase and will continue to buy Merrell in the future.", "summary": "Updated styling with same comfort you expect from Merrell", "unixReviewTime": 1502496000}

Just happy that I finally found a pair that I can lounge around in, throw on when I need to run a quick errand or two, or wear for just about anything when I feel like being comfy and casual. Depending on what's worn with them, they really can be worn for just about anything you want. in my opinion they look super cute with a nice t-shirt (I like the scoop necks, but everyone has their own style), short or long sleeve. I can't vouch for how long they will hold up, as I've only had them for around a month or so - at the time of this review - but they seem pretty well put together and feel like they'll hold up for a long while, depending on what you use them for. I don't think they're made to be a \"work\" overall, but as far as things go I feel like they will be a part of my wardrobe for several years. I've always loved the interchangeability of a decent looking pair of overalls. I will update my comment if I notice anything that needs to be mentioned later on, but for now I'm happy with my purchase. :-)", "summary": "Can't Think of a Title, But There is a Review...", "unixReviewTime": 1453334400}

I like the colors pictured a lot. It isn't super heavy-weight (a big positive!), but the hat is still substantial enough that I think it would work for most people as a winter/outdoor hat. Even though it is made of wool, it isn't suffocatingly heavy. The hat was not too small or tight at all, which I really liked. If you have an average (even verging on large) head, this should work just fine.\n\nThe company sent me the beige for review. I think I would love this hat if I'd gotten it in just about any other color, to be honest. I'm light-complected so this color just isn't striking enough for me. That's about me, and not about the hat, though. There is a seam down the front middle, but again, I think that might not show as much in a different color.\n\nSupergirl is one of my favorite hat companies. I own two or three of their hats and ordered another two because I was so happy with them.

The basic idea is good.\n2. The soft, very stretchy fabric is extremely comfortable.\n\nCons:\n1. No belt loops.  This significantly limits the versatility, as you need to wear your shirt out to cover the waistband.  For $40 the manufacturer could have included belt loops, and I can't see that there would be any downside to doing so.\n2. The fabric is thick and warm.  They'd be more accurately called Track Suit Jeans rather than Pajama Jeans.  In my climate they're nice for the colder half of the year, but hot for summer.\n3. The fabric has a silvery sheen at a shallow angle, maybe due to the spandex.  Because of the sheen it doesn't really look like denim.\n4. There are strange, faint, horizontal stripes in the front below the pockets.  What's up with that?  The manufacturer must have done it deliberately, but whatever their intent was, I don't like it.\n5. The waist drawstring (bias tape) has absolutely no stretch, so the pants can't be pulled off and on quickly.  I replaced the drawstring with 1/2\" elastic, and that works better for me.\n6. No choice of inseam length.  I'm just lucky that 32\" is my size.\n\nLack of a functional fly could be considered a pro or con.  It is inconvenient, but no worse than track suit pants.  And a zipper fly would compromise  the soft, stretchy comfort.\n\nDespite the longer list of cons than pros, I'm giving it 4 stars because of the comfort.

Its simple yet elegant. This necklace looks great as every day wear but it also has a sophisticated look so its perfect when dressing up for a special occasion.

The pendant is about 7/8 long and about .5 wide at the bottom. The pendant resembles a J or S shape. The top portion features seven crystals. The bottom portion features eleven crystals and has an ivory pearl set in the middle. I love that the pendant is 3 dimensional. The backside of the pendant is solid silver.\n\nThe chain slides through a large metal loop on the backside of the pendant. This gives the necklace an expensive look because it does not have a cheap looking loop attached to the top of the pendant. The chain is a box chain and the silver really shines. The chain that I received is 16 with a 2 extender that has an SCO tag on the end. It also has a medium sized lobster claw clasp which is easy to open. I do with the extender links were a bit larger as it can be difficult sometimes to get the clasp attached. My clasp also sticks sometimes so I have to be sure it closes all the way.

The shirt really complements my figure. It's clingy in the right spots. The neckline is a bit plunging, so unless you put a camisole or tank underneath, your girls will be on display. The pockets on the chest are a nice addition, too. The material is thin, but that's good in the spring and fall. This blouse is quite long on me (I'm 5'5\" and I can easily pull it down below my hip) and I prefer that.\n\nThe cons? This is going to be long. The sizing is way off. I'm normally a large, sometimes an XL. I ordered a 2XL and it fits well. I compared this blouse to other large and XL shirts in my closet and I'd say it's a small-ish XL or comparable to a generous large. The material is very stretchy, but the fit will be \"tight,\" so order up at least one size, maybe two, depending on what you want.\n\nThe workmanship is poor. As I was pulling the sleeve off my arm, I heard a tearing sound, and saw that the sleeve's seam had split a little. I barely pulled at the sleeve, too. I examined it a little more and I could see there wasn't much stitching on the seam. Little reinforcement. I am not surprised it split.\n\nI washed it on cold delicate cycle and hung to dry, thinking it was too fragile to really survive the dryer. Little did I realize, it was too fragile to survive the delicate cycle of the washer. See the picture I have attached - there's a tiny hole on the back behind where the tag is sewn. I'll be able to fix this pretty easily, but still, a hole after the FIRST wash?\n\nThere was also a lot of bleeding of the red dye. I hung this to dry to in my shower. I didn't realize the wet blouse was touching the shower curtain during the drying process. See the second picture. Reddish stain on my curtain. Crap.\n\nIn sum, I love how cute this blouse is, but it's kind of a disaster in every other respect. I can't really recommend it as anything other than a once-wear throwaway or a lounge-around-the-house deal.", "summary": "Adorable, but terrible quality", "unixReviewTime": 1466812800}

Honestly it probably would have worked its way how I like it just buy wearing it/breaking it in for a day but didn't want to wait.  I also have large arms and sometimes have trouble with junior shirts in that area but even after washing it's just right. It seems well made, nice 100% cotton, and washes well.

I've gotten so many compliments on this shirt already having worn it just a few times. It's SO DIFFICULT to find Pokemon shirts for girls/women that are also v-necks and fit women. Also wish there were more diversity of character for females.

It is the kind of piece you can make work with many styles. I love that because I like making the most of my money. When putting together pieces for my wardrobe, I want to know I will be able to mix and match the items I purchase. This piece is certainly a great fit for my needs.\n This is made of Rhodium. It is silver in color. The Rhodium is nice because it does not rust and it is nickel and lead free. It comes in a nice gold gift box and inside the box, it is padded with jewelers cotton and the bracelet is inside a sheer green gift bag. It presents quite well and makes for a lovely gift.\n  I like that this is age appropriate from teen years on. It is truly one of those universal pieces that women of all ages would love and it will never go out of style. It is not some trendy piece that will be out of style come next season. It is a beautiful piece and I get lots of compliments on it. It is comfortable enough for daily wear if you like. I am very happy with this piece.

I was so excited to get this coat, I have been looking for one like it for forever, so this was like a kid waiting for Santa Claus to come.  I finally received it and it did fit, I normally were a size 6 or a medium in US sizes so I initially ordered a large but at the last minute waso able to contact the seller  (who responded quickly) that I wanted to change it to an xl, and they were able to accomodate me.  It does fit, it's a little baggy in the waist area, but not tons so I think a large may have possibly been too small.  The coat does pretty much look like the photo.  The bow on the front does not come all perfect like that, it is just a tie and you make your own bow, good luck getting it to look like the photo haha.  Also the coat is super soft, it almost feels like a thinner, cheaper version of cashmere.  Its very lightweight and won't provide a lot of warmth for being what I would consider a winter jacket.  That's not even why I dropped stars off though, the stars dropped because of the sewing on the item its pretty bad.  I'm tempted to return it because I paid a lot and although I receive it at a discount, it wasn't a very big discount and I still haven't decided if I will keep it or not.  A lot of the seem have large amounts of excess string hanging off and I'm afraid to cut them as I don't know if the whole coat will come apart or what.  Also one of the front buttons is probably 1/4 inch lower than what is supposed to be its match, so it doesn't look completely symmentrical, and at the bottom poration on one side of the skirt, it seems it wasn't sewn In the right place so it bunches in one area where it shouldnt.  The armpits on the coat are also sewn too large so if you raise your arm even slightly the whole coat goes up with it. The cost is still cute and I do love the style, the collar is good the ruffled skirt looks great minus that one defect, but I just don't know due to the quality of the sewing if I would recommend this at this point.

After one washing these look like nubby pajamas. After two washings these ARE now used as pajamas. Poor quality material choice I guess. HAND WASH maybe?\nOriginal review.\nI stated that this fit as expected because I read the reviews. I knew the pants would be longer then what they should be for the tops fit. Also remember these are not USA sizes. My daughter wears a solid 7-8 or 8. I got the 9-10 and the top fits the way she like...a little loose...she is almost 7 and 50lbs and 48\". She is a very normal, average size.  Hope that helps you decide.\nNow the waist IS a little big and of course the length. However, 1) where the out may be big on one child it may not on another as it all depends of the build. 2) the pants are a very simple hem. And we are use to pinching the waist with a few stiches on her sweats.\nAlso, this is NOT a heavy sweat suit material. It's more like a softer, heavier tee shirt material. It is perfect for year around in Michigan, minus winter at recess she would wants her snow pants or footless tights/leggings outside.\nWe got the yellow and blue and it is 100% true to the picture! It is unique for our styles in the US and incrediably cute! I only hope it washes well! I don't dry any of her clothes because I buy a lot on Amazon and EBay and so we have brands from all over and I just have Berger luck not drying.\nIf you like the look online of this set you will love it in person! I am going to buy the orange and blue for my daughter  and the pink and gray for my niece.\nNote: the 9-10 has a tag that has the European size 140.\nI have it 4 stars because I think they should work on having the items match in size better.\nUPDATE:\nAs I mentioned, I liked it so much (still haven't washed it yet as this review is only 2 days old) I bought the other two colors but chose to get the orange in the next size for next year.\nWell, pictures attached, the sizes are practically identical. I don't have time to measure right now but I carefully compared the two against each other. The only somewhat difference is the width of the shirt and the tiniest bit in the waist but being eleastic that would matter much. It's possible the shirt MIGHT has the slightest length difference but considering that the shirt runs smaller then the pants and the pants are literally the exact same. (I even carefully payed them out and compared inseams. Identical.) It makes way more sense to buy the larger size and get a shirt that may have a bit more size to it to match the size of the pants better. Now this is the 9/10 (140) and the 11/12 (150) sizes. If your buying the 140 already expecting it to be big you would be fine (as I stayed the pants are the same anyway and you could easily hem these) because the little bit of extra room in the shirt of the 11/12 may make it to baggy for a child on the small end of the 9/10 size. Again my daughter is exactly 48\" and 50lbs and proportioned very averagely throughout. The 9/10 was perfect except pants length and that's why I wished the shirt was larger.

Soft and smooth on the outside, and it's almost fleece like on the inside. It feels amazing on my skin. It does hug every curve of your body. I have the white dress, and unfortunately it is very see through. Even with a nude bra, it was still easy to see the shape of it. If it weren't for that, I would love this dress immensely. I ordered the small, and it fit ok. I don't have a large enough backside to fill this out, so I had a little bit of excess fabric on the back. You can put the string through the back however you like, adding to the design. I nice belt or scarf can really set it off.\nI washed the dress in cold water, without the string through the back. I didn't want this to get tangled up. I then hung dry the dress, as the instructions state to not tumble dry.

The material is a silky smooth polyester, and the way the color gradiates down the shirt is fun.  The seams are finished nicely and I think this will wash well, for the price it's a fun wardrobe addition!  I just wish it was a little more fitted through the torso - the title of \"sexy slim\" had me expecting it to be a bit more form fitting.  There are chest darts, but other than that it falls straight.

Width of tubing of sock from heel to band: 6 and 1/4 inches all around\n\nI would recommend these socks for children or slender adolescents.

While waiting for it, I thought about what I was going to do with it...give it to my 10 year old who's been buggin about getting his own watch or maybe my mother-in-law for her birthday.  I don't normally wear a watch...don't wear anything on the wrist of the hand that I write with.  Besides, when I do go out, I always want to wear some cute bracelet.  Now, I got all in one!!!  The appearance of the watch far exceeded my expectations.  It is not easy to find a watch that works well but is also unique looking.  Not only is it unique to well known brand watches, it's one of a kind with the grain of the wood being one of a kind. I can't believe how they use texture & color to make such a statment in this piece...it's truly a piece of art!  Light weight and yet, not a delicate watch considering the wood they chose to make it from. Big without being chunky or thick to get in the way of movement or clothes. Packaging and presentation in the gift box makes it even more special, IF I still wanted to give it away. The watch comes with plenty of links in the wrist, so it fits pretty much anyone  you simply remove links to make the watch fit as needed. I fits my very small wrist a little loss & also my husband's rather large wrist (I think the thought of him stealing the watch from me HAS crossed his mind) and while its designed for women, it would still make a fashion statement when worn by a man!  I, my husband & my boys love this watch.  It really would make an amazing gift for anyone and has proven to be a great conversation starter aleady! It gets a lot of comments and I am now envied by my friends...I guess I already know what I'm getting all of them for Christams this year.  Oh, I checked, normally watches like these can easily exceed $200 with other companies so they'll think I spent much more on their gift.  I can't say a mistake has ever made me this happy!

Perfect for cleaning the lenses safely without scratching them. These sunglasses don't come with nose pads because they don't need them. Honestly I forgot that I had them on serval times throw out the day. They can be worn by a man or a women. My son has been eyeballing them, and he looks pretty good in them!

I love that they are so solid I keep them in the glove box in the carrying bag, and don't have to worry about them getting bent on accident. They are a great size for all face shapes and sizes.

It's easy to clean too - if the stones seem dull, drop it in a small glass with windex overnight, scrub a little with an old toothbrush and its shiny again!\n\nI've always been happy with SmitCo's line of what they sell and they do care about their customers, it's why I keep ordering things for me and my Granddaughter for them.

Also, with lace, not knowing if it will stretch or not I had planned on ordering up anyway.  Please be warned this top definitely runs small.  The large fit me like a glove.  Since the lace inserts in the sleeves are attached to a cotton (95%) spandex (5%) blend there is wiggle room.  There is also a lace inset in the back.  This is a beautiful top that is certainly curve-contouring and will get you noticed.  The lace adds a sexy seductive touch without being revealing.\n\nI purchased the black since just about everything in my closet is black and love it.  I like that there is a wide selection of colors to choose from.  You can dress it up or down most certainly and itll look great for date night or any night.

The fabric is nice and soft, as well as see through for some naughty time. This is not something to wear out in public as some have asked as it is too sheer. I also don't see the material being very durable for long during normal wear as it is very thin. No tears or rips on the top and seems well made.\nI ordered my wife the XXL which fit perfectly in most areas, although was a little snug around the breast area. The straps are adjustable so she was able to adjust the fit somewhat. The thong was well made with no tears or rips and is also see through. The back of the thong, where it attaches to the waist strap isn't sewn on, which is good for play time as it allows you to easily move the thong part over for easy access, but may move around a bit much during normal wear.\n\nI have received this item at a discount for a fair and honest review.

The straps all appear well made with good length, both on the shoulder and arm straps. The purse seems durable, thus far I haven't had any issues and I have been using it about three weeks.

Beautiful.  Do be aware when you order this bag that it is not made of real leather, but rather a PVC type leather (artificial).  This has it's advantages (strong, easy to clean, vegan, animal-cruelty free).  Because of the material though, there may be some odor to it when you first receive it.  Just let it air out and the smell should completely dissipate over a day or so.\n\nThis bag looks luxurious and rich.  Anyone could be fooled by the material and easily be convinced this is real leather.  It is soft to the touch with an incredibly smooth texture.  I have 3 bags by this company and all 3 bags follow the above mentioned description.\n\nThis particular bag has a strap and as such can also be worn as a cross-body style bag.  The bag closes securely with a zipper and has two main pockets on the inside.  Large enough for your daily essentials it is the perfect bag for casual use.\n\nMy favorite part of this bag is the color.  It is fun and bright yet appropriate for any season.  As a disclosure I received a free bag in exchange for my review.  I rate it 5 stars based on my personal use and experience with this product.  While not real leather, it looks fancy and beautiful enough to look great with any outfit.  Would recommend!", "summary": "Fun bag!", "unixReviewTime": 1453939200}

But it's not.\n\nIf you are a man who typically wears a size small, I'd go up to an XL or XXL (the biggest) unless you want a slim-fit jogger. At 5'4, there was barely enough length in a size Large for these to comfortably hit my ankles. The model must be shorter than me! I weigh about 125 pounds as well, and these were barely what I'd describe as loose. My husband is 6'2 and 200, and based on the size of the Large pair, I highly doubt an XXL would fit him.

And the longer skirt is flattering for my thighs! I love the retro look. I read all the helpful reviews before I ordered, and decided to go with the teal/green 6XL, based on the measurement chart. As mentioned in other reviews, the bra cups are very hard--I felt like Madonna in a cone bustier!! I liked the suit, but felt it was a little ill-fitted, so I bought a black 5XL to compare. SO much better! While the bra cups are really hard, the rest of the suit is super cute, so I'll deal with the cups. I'm a 38D, and everything fits, without a lot of cleavage, etc. I definitely don't feel \"old lady\" in it. Very happy, and I was easily able to return the first suit I bought.

Im always looking for something to add to the bedroom and with our upcoming wedding, I figured this might be a great idea for the night of the wedding. But upon closer inspection, I realized that its extremely poorly made. And by that, I mean I feel that they took scrap pieces of fabric and sewed it together on the bottom covering part that lays against the legs and splits up. The top half is pretty sound and flattering as well as fitting correctly. The lace design is classy and overall, its comfortable. However, the bottom portion is horribly cut. There are jagged edges. The sides are unevenly cut. There is a spot where it was cut into like the shape of a mountain. The seams are left exposed - they aren't folded over and sewn to complete the design. Overall, it was a horrible cut. The bikini thong is in perfect condition. Not much fabric to it but what else do you expect ;) I gave this a 3 star review because though the bottom definitely has its flaws, the top is sewn correctly, the fit is correct in proportion to the sizing I bought and the length, and the thong is in perfect condition as well. I hope in the future the seller pays more attention to the cutting of the bottom pieces. I strongly felt like mine was sewn together with scrap pieces.

While the assembly wasn't an issue (just threading the chain through the pendant) it is something to be aware of before presenting it to someone (and something that should have been mentioned in the description).\n\nOverall can't really go wrong with this.

There are two strands of \"potato\" shaped pearls. The way they lay on each strand of the necklace, though, is kind of \"kinky\".  You'd definitely have to twist the necklace or intertwine the strands prior to wearing if you want it to look anything like the picture.\n\nI knew they wouldn't be round nor of flawless quality, but I didn't think they'd have noticeable rings (?  Seams? or whatever you'd call them) around the middle.  This characteristic is much more prominent on the beige colored pearls; actually, at first I thought it was thin plastic adhered to the pearls to keep them together. If they were cheaper I'd probably keep them, but I just feel like I can get more uniform and attractive jewelry elsewhere.

Unique design:\nOne side of the scarf measures 31\" long, the other, longer size measures 59\".\nThese measurements are taken from the middle seam, at the back of the hood, to the very end of the scarf.\nThe pockets are about 9\" deep & are big enough for large hands. The pockets are cozy & warm.\nThe entire scarf has two layers/thicknesses which helps prevent the cold air from blowing through & keeps me warmer.\nWrap  the long end around your neck &  bring it forward.\nIf you're cold & need to use the pockets, you'll notice that the scarf could be a little longer.\n(When you first put your hands in the pockets your elbows will be bent.)  To remedy this, put your hands in the pockets & pull down a little bit.  This tightens the scarf around your neck which also will help lower the pockets.  Depending on your height this might bring the pockets down to a comfortable length.  If you're tall, more than likely your arms will be bent at the elbow when you use the pockets.\nMeasuring from the middle of your neck to your hand  should give you an idea of how this scarf will fit you (don't include your hand in the measurement).\n\nMy 5' 3\" friend measures 31\"  from the middle of her neck, down her arm to her hand.  When she wraps the long end around her neck, & puts her hands in the pockets, her elbows are slightly bent.  If she lengthens the scarf by putting her hands in the pockets & straightening her arms, the scarf tightens around her neck & the pockets are just right for her.  Her arms can be fully extended & the neck is still comfortable.\n\nThis hooded scarf with pockets is great for cold days.  It is soft, warm & comfortable.  The pockets are 9\" deep . My whole hand - up past my wrist fits inside.  Snug & warm.\nIf you're tall, this scarf might not work for you.\n\nReview Sample Provided\n\nI almost forgot to mention:\nI was surprised to see a Symbol of Traditional Chinese Culture included. Fashion Land included a Chinese Knot in the scarf's packaging.\nAn informative note explained:\n\"Chinese knot is unique Chinese folk manual techniques adornment,\nChinese knot after thousands of years of evolution knot arts has been called the masses enjoy refined colorful art.\nThe combination of different modelling marks a strong full-bodied wishes, praise & convey faithfully zhicheng prayers & good wishes.\"\nThank you for the good wishes, Fashion Land.", "summary": "Very soft, very warm, hooded scarf with 9\" deep pockets.

CONS: If you like a nice lining inside your purse then you will hate this product. In the photo i demonstrate the inside stitch that is at the bottom of each compatment. A big fat lining of horrible outter material.  Also, The material has a slippery almost slimmy feel to it so if you like to carry under your arm it will not stay no matter how hard you clinch it will just shoot out because its almost greasy feeling...  wierd material you will need a hand sander to get any kind of grip on it... And it smells really bad because they put some lavendar scent thing in it... Its like a scent bag you would use for your car... PROS: it fits a iphone 6s plus...

I received it on time and the packaging that was mentioned in the majority of the reviews were very accurate,  they do take pride in packaging which is a great part to the over all presentation.  I was very impressed on the size and what this little purse actually holds.  I transferred what was in my shoulder back and it all fit.  I even have a portable charger that is not huge but not sleek either but fit great and did not add bulk.  The purse is very soft and not cheesy looking.  I really hate purses that are not actually real leather and are stiff.  I love how there is one zipper on top that opens up to the three open compartments inside.  There is actually 5 if you consider extra slots to keep say receipts or extra cc or gum so that does make it very nice. People were also commenting on the smell.  There  is a smell to it that is to me not natural leather but still not bad like some people had commented.  I do want to say the one thing I am not very happy with is the color that is why I am only giving 4 stars.  In going through the reviews before I purchased I was trying to get a read on how the color's were once they received the purse but could only find 1 comment on the purple one.  I will say that I ordered the brown/tan thinking summer is coming and that is a great neutral color for summer.  I was less than impressed.  In the light it is more of a burnt orange not brown.  I have had a purse in that color before and it is a good color but still not what I was expecting but would not return because I do love everything else about it and it's not so bad that I just would refuse to use it.  I really would recommend this purse to others.

It has 2 snaps on the neck area so it'll be easier for you to put this on to your baby. I got the 18M size and it fits perfectly in my baby. It keeps her warm during this winter season.

The design is super cute, the designs remind me of Mini Boden, so I wanted to love it since it's so much cheaper than the designer brands.\nMy daughter is 4 and many times she can wear either a 5 or 6 in shirts so I ordered the 6 in the dog design so that she can perhaps get two winters use out of it. The sizing is as expected and is similar to her other shirts. What stops me from loving this is that even the size 6 came with two snaps at the neck. Normally when a child is this old you don't need snaps at the neck to fit the shirt over the head. So I found this really odd, and makes it look more like a baby or toddler shirt and not something for a 4-6 year old. Another thing that really threw me off was it came with a Jumping Beans tag. Now, normally you find those at Kohl's, and even the listing says the designs are owned by Fiream so I found it super odd that they would be on a Jumping Beans shirt.\nSo, I'd say if you have a younger child the shirts are great as the snapped neck is to be expected. For an older child such as my daughter I wouldn't recommend these unless your child has a really large head and needs the snaps...\nThe design is cute, my daughter loves the dog. The fabric is 100% cotton and soft. So I do like it, it just isn't love like I had hoped.\nI did receive this for free for my honest review, but all opinions are my own.", "summary": "Even large sizes have snapped necks...", "unixReviewTime": 1454803200}

Online, the wand looked good. It seemed to be a resin wand with a nice case, and even though its not WB approved, it appeared to be of similar quality to the ones being offered at almost three times the price.\n\nWhen the wand arrived, I found this wasn't true. The first wand I received was broken in the container. The box seemed undamaged, but somehow, the flimsy want had shattered in three pieces. When I saw this, I contacted the seller, who then told me they would ship me an new one PLUS an additional wand. Nearly a week went by, and I had not heard from them. I contacted the seller 10 days later. They said they had no record of my purchase, but that if I could prove it, they would send the two wands.\n\nNeedless to say, after I sent the confirmation, they finally sent a wand to me. Notice: a wand. I finally received my intact wand (in a very crushed up box) on June 8, after my initial order was placed on April 08. Needless to say, I didn't want to give my friend a broken box or a broken wand.\nIt should also be noted that the second wand that I got, the box was badly printed, the magnets did not keep the box closed, and there was no script reading Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince on the front.\n\nAfter this whole ordeal, I inspected the wand and found that it had bits on metal embedded in it. The paint job was shoddy, and I found myself regretting buying the wand. Fortunately, with a bit of ingenuity and some paint, I was able to make the wand look a bit more like Lunas second wand, and I recovered the box with some beautiful fabric and paint to make it look more like a case Luna might use.\n\nOverall, I had a meh experience with this. The product wasn't great, the experience was bad- BUT I did at least get the wand in the end.\n\nBasically it boils down to this. If you're looking for a ready made wand thats perfect for your costume and a display box, this is NOT the wand for you. If you're okay with doing a little DIY and you just want the wand shape and a box to begin with, Go ahead! For the price, you get what you pay for!\n\nIn full disclosure, I have received this product for a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion. With this in mind, I have no relation to the seller, and make sure that everything in my review is my honest opinion that has been in no way influenced by any outside sources.

The wand does have a little imperfections but only in places where it's not really noticeable like the end that's in the palm of your hand. This wand is not made of wood it's a resin cast replica so it's actually a little flexible if you try to bend it. You can also smell it! It's like a urethane or something.

Honestly, neither of us really knew what his wand looked like, but a little research told us that this is his first wand.  For those of you who haven't read the books, Neville's first wand is broken in book five.  Though if you don't know that, you're probably not interested in replica Harry Potter wands ;).  Nevertheless, I trusted that anyone who makes and sells replica HP wands will know exactly what each character's wands (from the movies at least) look like.\nThe case is nice, it's solid with an odd array of artwork from The Deathly Hallows.  I would have preferred something less about advertising and more styled in a way that evokes \"wizarding community,\" as it would make it more displayable.  Then again I ordered a wand replica, not a box replica.\nThe wand is great.  It looks just like the photos.  It's great quality too: solid with some weight behind it.  If you wanted, you can use it as a prop (our friends have had our fair share of Potter parties), just display it (it will definitely keep if you don't use it a lot), or out right play with it (but it probably won't last forever in that option).  At the end of the day, it's a great collectors item, because let's face it, there's no real practical use for a replica wand other than to share in the magic of HP.

It looked pretty boring. Admittedly I was looking at an online picture and not at the reproduction in the Ollivander shop at Universal. I ordered one anyway because my son loves HP wands and Viktor is one of his favorite characters. I was very pleasantly surprised when I received the wand that it is actually a lot prettier than one would think from the online picture. The difference is in the detail of the handle.\n\nComparing the Vanko wand to what is shown in the HP film, I think they nailed it. In the film, the wand appears with a light color, is curved at the handle and the tip, and does not have a separate handle. At the end of the handle is a roughly carved face that resembles a bird. The color of the wand I received is very close to what is shown in the movie. There is quite a bit of detail to make it look like a roughly carved bird on the handle. It is a well-done replica. My son is thrilled with this wand. I also like the fact that the wand is a little thicker than most and should hopefully be a little harder to break.\n\nI have other HP wands by Vanko and I am happy with the quality of the wands.

The built in bra might be good for not busty woman, i am not that busty, i wear a size C cup but i still prefer to wear a bra with this, it does not give a lot of support. The straps are detachable, which is awesome if you want to wear this with a strapless dress. It does have a zipper and clasp in the back, maybe to make it easy to take of? I think it is just super easy to slip over like a normal shirt, but when taking it off i do find the zipper and clasp in the back helpful so i can take this off without taking off my other shirt. It does slim me down a little bit, and just makes me feel good while wearing it!\n  the one complaint i have about this is the smell, i don't know what it is but it is such a strong smell, i washed it like in the directions said to do, hand wash and hang dry, and the smell still didn't come all the way out. Hopefully next wash the smell will be gone, because it is very unpleasant. Overall i do like this camisole a lot, and wear it all the time under my clothes to slim me down a little bit, it is also a nice undershirt for like button ups.\n- I did receive this product for free in return for my honest and unbiased opinion.

First off I should say it is well made, except for one little string sticking out of the shoulder. Also it's a really nice material. I love the pattern they have going on, but if you're over 100 pounds this probably won't fit. I wouldn't consider myself a fat person, but this made me feel obese. When it comes to sweatshirts I usually get a medium, because I like a nice baggy feel. So with this I got the US 10. Which is the 2XL in their world. I swear the women over there must be super SUPER tiny, because if this is a 2XL I can't even fathom what their Small would look like.\nAnyway because their sizes are always a little off I figured go big. Worst case scenario it'll be too big, which isn't really even possible when it comes to sweatshirts. So, like I was saying I assumed this would be baggy on me. Well I couldn't even get my arms in it. Without putting my arms in the sleeves I could slide it past my shoulders, but it only went to about two inches below my boobs. So there is no way this will fit me. It could definitely pass as childrens clothing. Which sucks because it's really cute. Too bad it's so small. For comparison I put a photo of this sweatshirt laying on top of a medium sweatshirt.

For the $25-ish price I was absolutely blown away and I will be taking a close look at more products from this designer. This top goes very well with leggings or skinny jeans. The inner layer is long enough to drape almost mid thigh in the front and the back drapes down past my knees but flutters open like wings.

Obviously cannot tell you how it washes yet either. I did already log on & ordered another one in a different color. All size Large were sold out in the other 2 colors so I ordered a Medium. I know a medium will fit too as I had said, the innermost too is stretchy. The medium may actually fit me better.  I am a big fashion bug & I like things that are different & unique.

We always have the air running, and my skin tends to get very chilled. I have a blanket in my office to help keep my legs warm while wearing a skirt, and I usually wear a cardigan with a scarf of some type. When I saw this cardigan, I thought that I could never have too many black cardigans, so I wanted another. This was priced okay and it looked like a good product. I placed the order and this was shipped to me really quickly. This came sealed in plastic wrapping. I tried this on, and it fits me well. I thought that this may run a bit small, so I ordered this in an extra large. I am a medium size in t-shirts, but I like the way that cardigans fit when they are a bit larger and longer on me, especially the longer sleeves. I would say that this extra large is really more of a large. It still fits me okay and I am keeping it. The sleeves are a good length and rest just beneath my wrists. I washed this, and it did not fade or lose any form. The stitching is good on this, and I did not note any loose threads. This does help to keep me warm. The lightweight material makes this easy to throw on and dress up or down with a skirt or jeans. I am happy with this product and I would recommend it.

The fabric is very similar to an opaque pair of tights, and they kind of looked like it on my arms.\n\nDue to the close-fitted arms, I got a little warmer in this a little more quickly than normal.  This will not stop me from adding it to my regular wardrobe rotation.  The main body still drapes nicely and it doesn't feel like I'm about to hulk out of the seams.  This would be great for places that always feel cold without having to carry a bulky jacket or sweater, and it can be folded small enough to fit into a purse if you no longer need it and don't want to carry it or go all the way back to the car.\n\nI picked the beige, and kind of wish I would have picked something more colorful, but it still works and even matches a pair of my shoes.  If you like a baggier fit, I would recommend picking a size bigger than what you normally wear.\n\nOne drawback is that the fabric does act like tights, so be cautious when laundering.  Doing it improperly can result in pilling, tears, and snags.  This is not a manufacturing issue, but the nature of the fabric so be aware.\n\nI received a discount on this product so that I would provide a fair and unbiased review.", "summary": "It's like leggings for your arms.", "unixReviewTime": 1458259200}

They really liked them and the watches are much better in person as the pictures don't show you how the light hits them and highlights the wood.  I had to knock a star off of the women's watch, however, as it was way too small for my mother in law.  The mens watch was way too big for my father in law so they switched watches.  Whatever works for them, but that does tell me that it is important on these watches to measure your wrist to make sure it will fit.  Links are removable but no extra links are included.  Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase.  The watch runs well, has a quiet tick and looks incredibly expensive.  The boyfriend watch look is in right now so if you are a lady don't stress about the size of the womens watch if you have big wrists.  Go for the mens.  If you are a man and have little wrists, go for the ladies.  They are both nice.\n\nI purchased this wooden watch at a deep discount so I could offer my review of it. All opinions are truly my own and it is my pleasure to be able to offer others my thoughts so they might be able to make informed decisions as to whether products are appropriate for them. I am not a paid reviewer and I am in no way required by the seller to leave positive remarks about their product. I gain nothing by giving this item a positve, negative or neutral review.

I fell in love with it the moment I saw it and it is even more beautiful in person.  The watch sits on a watch pillow inside a gift box for a nice gift presentation.\n\nThe watch is handmade from beautifully crafted solid Zebrawood giving it a unique striped appearance.  The color and wood grain vary due to it being made from the real deal and is what really gives this watch its beauty.  I get so many compliments on this and it really draws people in with curiosity.  I am always getting asked if my watch is made of wood.\n\nThe face of the watch has a steel ring around the outer dial with a clear plastic casing.  It has black and silver design for the minute/hour indications.  The date is displayed on the face of the watch.  The minute and hour hands both glow in the dark for easy reference.  There is a stainless steel turn dial on the left of the watch to set the time and date.  The overall design of the face on this watch is stunning and the different wood color variations make this one of its kind.\n\nThe watch is waterproof up to 30m however I don't use it in or around water.  The skins natural oil will make this watch luster over time and even more beautiful.  It can be made smaller to fit even the smallest of wrists allowing up to three links removed on each side.  It opens and closes using a stainless steel push button clasp that makes it easy to put on and off on your own.\n\nThis watch has a matching men's watch you can purchase separately to make a couples set.  This makes a great gift idea, I would of loved to have received this from my husband unexpectedly.  The wooden watch is on trendy right now and is very stylish both on and off the wrist.\n\nOverall both the quality and look of this watch exceeded any and all my expectations.  I highly recommend this to others.  I received this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest unbiased review.  All opinions are 100% my own.

I went to a gift shop inside a musuem and found them priced at $24.99. $24.99? When they're this much on amazon? Highway robbery! But, people buy them, and that's why they stock them. After receiving these, both mom-in-law and aunt-in-law want Maroon and Teal slouch-hats. The slouch isn't overly pronouned (rastafari style), which is perfect. It does fit a bun without stretching out awkwardly, and that's why I got them!\n\nExcellent fit and price! 5/5\n\nThere is more color variety available here than any other outlet I've encountered, so I have already ordered more (pumpkin, maroon, silver, black). The mustard-color within this set is excellent -- too often Mustard = violent yellow, and not the calm autumnal tone one hopes for! The cinch of the hat is great, and even with some exaggerated movement, the hat doesn't slip off! Nor is it constricting!\n\nIf I could make a change, it would be to add additional textures, but keep the clunky knit! Not a reason to give it any less than 5/5, just hoping for future developments that expand on these great hats! Breathable and warm, preventing your hair from becoming a mess of sweat, just to keep warm in the wind!

It's one size fits all for kids, it just stretches over their head. I'll have to tie a knot in the back, my son has a tiny neck, but that means it should last him a few years!

I know it says it for kids but before I give it to kids us adults are going to have some fun.  This is a super perfect prop for our fun Photo Booth we are doing at our holiday Christmas party.  This tie is really super cute it is red and has sequins on it.  There is an LED light that runs the length of the tie and shines through the material.  The light has three settings: a super-fast blink, medium speed and slow speed.  The necktie does not have to be tied it has an elastic strip that is connected to it so you just slip it on over your head.  This is a super fun tie for kids and adults.\n\nDISCLAIMER  I received this product at no cost in exchange for my honest opinion and review.

All of the basics are there, but the brushed, stainless finish on the case is far more coarse, there are little dings in the finish, especially where the case meets the crystal.  The sharp, clearly visible roman numerals in the picture are, instead, barely contrasting with a DARK bezel, so that they are hardly visible/legible at all. There is a 3x4mm area of abrasion on the bezel /crystal between 9 and 10. There are numerous, terrible scratches on the back of the watch, and the plating is either worn off or simply absent on part of the back, leaving patches of exposed brass showing through. OK. For $37, I didn't expect a Rolex or even a Timex, but I do expect a running, and undamaged watch, and though it does appear to run, it falls miserably short in the second category, and one out of two just doesn't cut it here. Basically, this thing looks like a cheap, not so well used watch on which someone stuck a new band, so they could sell it after it had been returned.

I washed them off with some dish soap and hot water - once the smell was gone, they are pretty cute sunglasses!  Mine actually do look like the picture.  They're very lightly-tinted shades - so not meant for super sunny days.  I loved that one woman's recommendation of wearing with a big floppy hat!

I got these in the silver color and when I opened my package, I saw problems right off the bat. First off, the right hinge on mine is broken. It's really difficult to open the right side and it doesn't even open all the way. Because it doesn't open all the way, it digs into the side of your head and it's really uncomfortable. Secondly, the sides of the sunglasses are painted white and it was already chipped off of the right side, near the hinge, when I opened the package. Next, there's a weird mark on the bottom center of the glasses. It looks like where it's been welded together? Anyways, it just looks odd and really cheap looking. Lastly, the sunglasses case is too small for the sunglasses. The sunglasses stick out and you can't even close the case. I'm so disappointed because like I said, they are cute but sadly I will definitely be returning these.\n\nThis is my second attempt at posting this review.

(There was ANOTHER watch that I ordered from the same vendor and it was pretty unfortunate) This watch is as glitzy in person as it is in the ad pics,  and is easy to read. There appears to be no damage or wear on the more visible areas. There are some light scratches on the back, but they aren't bad, the plating is intact, and I suspect that they are just the result of some less-than-careful handling at the factory or warehouse. When worn, no one will see them and they aren't deep enough to create abrasion to the skin. The watch does NOT have any box, just a little plastic seam-lock type bag, and that's also likely why it's picked up those scratches.\nThere are some minor issues-\nWhen setting the watch, I noticed that the minute hand does not completely clear all of the hour markers. They aren't high enough to stop it, but there is a little noticeable hang-up as it passes over them when manually moving the hand to set it. Also, (and at first this really concerned me) while in the setting mode, with the stem pulled out, it was actually possible to cause the minute hand to move by itself, about +/- 4-5 minutes, just by tilting the watch, even with the stem securely held in place. FORTUNATELY, after setting (and not tilting the watch) re-pressing to stem to start the movement must re-engage the movement's control of the hand sufficiently so that that loose movement is no-longer elicitable, and does not manifest after the watch is back to running. The strap was basic but not bad.\nAs to accuracy- I set the watch to 1/2sec slow and rechecked it after >24hrs, and it was still about 12-3/4 sec slow- Acceptable, but note that this was with the watch still in box, not worn. So I don't yet know if that will effect it.\nOverall, I'd say, for the money, if you're looking for an inexpensive watch for a younger person or that Eeyore fan in your life, ( who already has a bunch of expensive watches to fall back on, but might want something to wear at work for a lark ) then this might be a good, low-buck gamble, fun buy for a stocking stuffer, which is why I gave it 4-stars.", "summary": "At this price...not completely bad", "unixReviewTime": 1506556800}

This turned out to be a pretty decent sweater after all. In fact, I went ahead and ordered the other color offered.

It has just the exact look that I wanted. I'm glad I didn't go by all the negative reviews. The picture shown is exactly what it looks like.

It's very pretty and I love the bright color. It's not neon bright, just a happy bright pink.\n\nThe card slots are great because they don't go too far down. I had a wallet once where the slots went too far down and my cards would get stuck, but this wallet doesn't have that problem. I fit a lot of cards in the card slots. There is also a large space to put paper money. The only thing this is missing is a zippered coin pocket. I usually don't have coins anyway but it would be nice to have.\n\nAfter I put all my junk in the wallet, it doesn't stay closed, but I just throw it in the middle section of my purse so I don't really care. It doesn't have any kind of closure so if that's a problem for you, don't get this.\n\nI really like this wallet and use it as my everyday wallet.

I have worn it through Chicago with snow and wind and my ears and (bald) head have stayed warm.\n\nMy only complaint would be the bulk at the top of the hat. It has what I would call an \"in between\" amount of material up there. It is too bulky to fit snug to the head and not bulky enough to fold down a bit like some hats (as in the photo). It ends up with this somewhat awkward in between stage that looks a little weird to me. That being said, I still like the hat, love that it doesn't make my head itch, and it is very warm.\n\nI received this product at a discounted price in exchange for providing an honest review.

I'm plus size and it was pretty frustrating trying to find a dress that wasn't huge, matronly looking, or had 20 different layers. I pretty much had given up trying to find an elegant dress that didn't overwhelm me. Thankfully two months before my wedding, I randomly looked on Amazon and saw this very pretty style dress. I loved the light lace overlay on the bodice, the color of the champagne tulle, the cute buttons, and the open arm cut. Since the dress was so inexpensive, I thought \"what do I have to lose?\" and ordered one in my size.\n\nThe next day after placing my order I received an email from the maker saying they had a surprise and asked what my measurements were!! It turns out they made my dress to size. I had no idea they offered tailoring! So I sent them my measurements and (I had seen the shipping might take up to two months since it is shipping from China) asked if there was any way I could pay extra for expedited shipping to make sure the dress arrived on time. I received an email back within 12 hours saying no extra charge was needed and that they would work hard to make sure my dress shipped out as quickly as possible. The seller went above and beyond and I'm so grateful to them!\n\nI received the dress after 3 weeks and it was packaged with a lot of love. They turned the dress inside out and wrapped it in such a way that no damage could have happened to it (there were a couple of wrinkles on the satin lining, but they easily came out with a little steaming. I was so excited unwrapping the dress and feeling the great quality of the fabric. I tried the dress on and it fit like a dream! It was so light weight and even prettier than the product picture. The lining of the dress and bodice is a double sided satin, there are two layers of tulle on the champagne dress (bottom layer white tulle, top layer a lovely beige), the lace overlay was sturdy yet delicate in appearance and trimmed nicely, and then the custom fit just really made the whole thing so special.\n\nI'm so happy with this dress and received a million compliments when I wore it. Seriously it couldn't have been any better. I 100% recommend buying this dress and working with this incredible seller!", "summary": "So beautiful and made to size!!", "unixReviewTime": 1479513600}

Uh oh. Does this mean it's made out of crappy material? Read on.\n\nThe body of the dress is completely straight and not flowy at all, making it difficult to walk. It's covered by two layers of cheap tulle that would not uncrinkle. This is the type of material my kids use in arts and crafts to make bug nets.\n\nThe top of the dress is strapless with lace over tulle and very itchy. The distance from my shoulders to where my boobs go is too far apart. Now, I know I've nursed 4 kids and my tits are headed south, but not THAT far south. Not to mention, its \"padded\". I mean, these\"pads\" were made for a girl with a B cup, at most. Not a double D like myself. It literally looks like I've got huge, hard nipples all the time...\n\nThe arm holes are also too big and gap open. I could alter the dress but I'd have to widen the skirt so it flows, replace the tulle with better lace, take up the shoulders ( which would be tricky seeing how it's got a lace pattern I'd  probably end up ruining), and then, well, it probably would be easier to just get a whole new dress.\n\nThe color was pretty, I'll give them that.\n\nSo I guess if you have a cookie cutter size 5 body, you'll do alright with this.

You can dress it up quite nicely with a high waisted belt and high heels, and it looks especially cute worn with a western belt and cowboy boots. And since this mini dress is a cotton blend, it makes for a simple, yet super cute and extremely comfy swimsuit cover-up! In the colder months, it would work really well with a pair of tights and knee high boots or high heeled booties. However you choose to wear it, one thing is for certain; it's incredibly comfortable and stylish. If you're concerned about sizing, I'm 5'9, 160lbs and a 38DD. I ordered the XL, but could've very well went with a large. It really does fit true to size. And I especially love the cold shoulder detail.\nIn full disclosure, this item was supplied to me at a discounted rate to test and evaluate it for their customers. I was not told what to write, nor was I asked to give it a certain rating. I always give my honest and unbiased opinion of each product.

I should have ordered one more size up. The sweatshirt is 100% cotton and more of a light weight material.

The fabric is somewhere between a traditional sweatshirt material and a spandex workout blend; it's very soft and washes well (I typically damp dry items in my dryer for about 15 minutes on low, and then hang them to dry).  So far it hasn't pilled much and is holding its shape nicely. The asymmetrical zipper is very flattering and slimming.  It is lightweight and layers well.  Typically I wear a S or M in most sweatshirts, so with this one I ordered the medium, based on the fact that I'm curvy, along with other reviews that said it might be long enough for leggings with a larger fit.  I'm only about 5'3\".  The M was actually pretty tight across my hips and not quite long enough to cover my behind, so I think I might have been happier ordering a L.  The only thing long about this is the sleeves - I'm glad for the thumb loops to keep them in check!  Still, this sweatshirt looks great with jeans or casual skirts, and is really comfortable.

The general size is fine, but there really needs to be a \"fits odd\" option for mis-made clothing like this.\n\nLike many manufacturers of plus sized clothing, Ulla Popken seems to have completely forgotten about arms.\n\nMany manufacturers will take a regular sized garment and resize it larger, but take no notice of the size of the arms. We are left with garments that fit our bodies, but are ridiculously snug against the arms.\n\nA loose, gauzy jacket should have reasonably loose arms. This one does not. They are TIGHT.\n\nI am a fairly proportional woman. I do not have popeye arms. The sleeves in this jacket are very, very snug. If you look at the picture, snug arms do not really fit the look of this garment. I am perpetually baffled by this choice in garment designers. Is fabric so very expensive that saving a few millimeters on arm sizes makes a profit difference? Or do they just assume that larger women just swell up in the middle like balloons and maintain slender limbs?\n\nThe arms are also significantly shorter than they appear in the picture, hitting barely below the elbow, with the snug lace making bending difficult. I am tall, though, so perhaps on a very short woman they would be the right length (as long as her arms are much slenderer than the rest of her body).\n\nOr maybe on a tyrannosaurus. The arms are perfect for a tyrannosaurus. If you are carnivorous, green, large, and have teeny little arms, I strongly suggest you grab this right away.

They even feel better in the hours after wearing them. I broke one of my toes years ago and it has caused pain in that foot, these shoes really help alleviate the pain that would run up the top of my foot. Another thing, the shoes have a wide sole that gives you good balance and the padding under your feet the \"boost technology\", is like standing on the most comfortable marshmallow pad you could imagine, sorry best way I could describe it. Also be sure to order your correct size, I think many people are wearing these too small. I would recommend going up a half size from your typical Nike size, if you wear a 10 in most Nikes get a 10.5 in Yeezy 350s. If they're too tight I don't think you get the full orthopedic benefits of the shoe.
