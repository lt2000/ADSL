If you are like me, when you travel you like to have all your makeup along with a variety of clothing options. When evaluating this weekender with others, this bag rose above the rest due to a combination of traits.  More specifically, us professional packers/travelers are looking for a bag that is large enough to fit our over packing needs, comfortable and easy to carry, tasteful enough to look fashionable, and durable to keep up with our many weekend adventures. Needless to say, it is important to be very particular when selecting a weekender style bag.\n\nSize: This tote is deceiving in that you worry that you may not fit everything inside at first glance. However, the slouch design along with the widened zipper opening of the bag allows for ample space. If everything does not fit in the bag, leaving the zippers open is always an alternative.\n\nPockets: The two patch pockets combined with the zip pocket on the interior sides of the bag give you the perfect hiding spot for those smaller items. This allows the user to keep items upright or in a safe place to avoid losing.\n\nHandles: This weekender provides a couple different options to comfortably transport it. The two handles along with the adjustable/removable shoulder strap, allows for you to change positions of the bag while carrying it. The two handles make it easier to transport it short distances or in and out of vehicles.\n\nMaterial: This 100% Polyurethane bag is ideal in the fact it is waterproof, washable, flexible, and lightweight. It is also a cheaper, lower maintenance alternative to leather. The material will scuff, for example if drug along the sidewalk, but there are small feet on the bottom of the bag to help prevent this from happening. The 100% cotton interior also is beneficial so if you have product leakage it is possible to clean it.\n\nStyle: This weekender is a good combination of function and fashion. It is an attractive, affordable bag with a name brand look. The simple design and coloring gives it a timeless appearance. The interior has gold accents, which make it unique in its kind.\n\nIf looking for a weekender style bag, I would encourage taking this tote into consideration for the reasons listed above. Thank you for reading.", "summary": "Great Weekender Style Bag", "unixReviewTime": 1455235200}

It's a bit snug and I ordered one size up.\n\nThe dress actually looks pretty nice on though it has more pleats in the front than pictured (see photo). I didn't expect miracles in this budget so I was anticipating having to make a few minor adjustments.\n\nCons: The zipper was jammed with part of the lace and part of the waistband. Even after carefully unjamming the fabric the zipper continues to stick in that area. At first glance I can't tell if there is still glue on the teeth or if the zipper has damage. The waistband is not attached in the back. This wouldn't be an issue except it is literally hot glued to the fabric. It could easily be pulled all the way off but I'd have to find something to replace it (the glue on the fabric underneath is pretty unsightly). I could try a belt but may need to stitch it into place to prevent it from slipping and revealing the glue underneath. It has a bit of a short train in the back but no built in hooks for a bustle. That would definitely have to be added to wear at reception.\n\nPros: for just over $100 the money I saved could easily pay for the adjustments needed. The dress is plenty long for me to wear heels (would probably still need hemmed and I'm 5'7\"). The ivory I received is not yellowed. Honestly, I wouldn't have noticed it wasn't \"white.\"\n\nI'll probably return it and keep looking.

I did cut off the fringe bec it did look messy. But then every time I washed it, the RSVP embroidered letters shrunk up more than the fabric did, so the fabric got all bunched up around them. I can't wear it in public anymore, so now it's just an expensive pajama top. :(  If you really want to try this shirt, you'll have to hang dry. To be fair to the manufacturer, the instructions do say \"hang to dry\" or dry clean.  I just don't have time for that, so I put most things in the dryer anyway and hope they survive. I will dry clean nice clothes, or hand wash as a last resort, but I'm not going to dry clean or hand wash a t-shirt.\n\nOriginal review: Nice casual shirt, I normally wear a 0X but they don't offer that size in Penningtons so I ordered their 1X. I'm 5' tall, 190 lbs., 44-42-48 and this fits nicely loose (I wish it was a tad smaller but maybe will shrink a bit since it's 100% cotton). It's definitely relaxed fit, not fitted. Top measures 25.5\" from pit to pit and 30\" long from shoulder to hem in back. Sleeves are about 10\" from shoulder hem to bottom hem, not too short like many tops. The material is lightweight but not transparent, feels like it will be comfy. I don't like the fringe under the letters, looks like it's going to get messy over time, so I'll cut it off. Overall it's a nice T-shirt top.", "summary": "Overall it's a nice T-shirt top BUT it MUST be hung dry or the embroidery will shrink up.", "unixReviewTime": 1455494400}

I normally wear an XL so when I ordered I ordered a XXX-LG, it was still too small.  The XXX-LG fits like a medium.  I was really bummed because it is a really nice hoodie.  Luckily my daughter wears a medium and it fit her perfectly.\n\nThe hoodie is a double lining, which is cool. The inside hoodie is grey and the outside pink like the rest of it.  The inside of the sweater is so soft and so snugly.  It is made really well and is thick but a loose moving thickness(if that makes sense).\n\nIt does keep you really warm and is very comfortable. My daughter says it is like snuggling in a warm fleece blanket.  The pockets in front go all the way across.\n\nI struggled on how many stars to give this because of the sizing, but honestly it being way too small is the only thing that is bad.  It is a really good quality hoodie and made well.  If you purchase this, please keep in mind how small it really runs!\n\n**I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.

I have been trying to find a horseshoe pendant that is a little bigger such as this one. I like to wear larger pendants  I am a larger girl (size 16) and petite jewelry gets lost on me and my big hair. This necklace is perfect for my neckline!\n\nThe pendant is encrusted in beautiful faceted cubic zirconias that are PERFECTLY set into the horseshoe. The crystals do NOT stick up and threaten to fall out  they are set IN the pendant and it is almost smooth to the touch. This results in a continuous look that is very flashy and beautiful. The light hits these crystals and since they are genuine zirconas, they are extremely glittery and classy.\n\nThe horseshoe pendant symbolizes good luck and protection. People used to hang horseshoes over their home to ward off evil  now they wear them around their necks! It also protects from nightmares and helps with exams. I need all the help I can get with exams as I am taking my state boards for nursing in a month and need that extra bit of luck!!!\n\nThe pendant comes in a beautiful box suitable for wrapping and gifting and a velvet bag. A very nice, timeless design good for all ages  5/5 stars!\n\nIf you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a free promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Delicate horseshoe design brings good luck", "unixReviewTime": 1450742400}

I bought about 15 pairs with different black on black prints and, honestly, I wear them all day every day. They are super soft inside due to the fleece and sooooo cozy, but yet they also look really good on. I wear them to just lounge around the house with a hoodie. Or I wear them out on the town with a cute top and boots. I've tried many similar looking pants, like ponte pants, but I can't wear them after wearing these leggings because these leggings are so much more comfortable. And so inexpensive! It's great to buy 10 pairs for the same price other brands would charge for one pair of pants.\n\nOnly trouble is that, with certain pairs, the dye rubs off on to other things when you first get them. So best to wash them twice before wearing. That's my only complaint!", "summary": "Love these leggings", "unixReviewTime": 1483401600}

The material is nice and soft and nice quality. I like the way the fringe lays on the front. It's not all wrinkled and going every which way. The bottom on this is flat so this is nice because the purse will stand up on it's own and not tip over on you when you set it down. It has 1 single snap closure which snaps tightly but I keep quite a bit in my purses so I haven't been using the snap.\n\nOn the inside, there is just one main open compartment. On one side there are 2 small pockets which you can put your phone or small things like chapstick/lipstick, keys and things you want easy access to. The other side has a small zippered pocket. All the stitching on this and its construction are done very well. The strap is adjustable and this can be used as a shoulder or cross body which is nice. You also get a small little holder for photo's or cards which is nice. Overall, a really nice, stylish bag that I have had many compliments on.\nI received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

First she said was, it was so comfortable to wear.  It fitted her perfectly and exactly gave her the elegance and the warmth that she needs.  So, it is fashion and functionality both at the same time that she got with this outfit.  This is not heavy nor that light.  It just feels perfect for her.  The length was also just right for her.  Even the cut was exact. I ordered the color black which she said was nice for it can be paired with any other color of her outfits.  It really looked very nice on her as she wore it.  This is really perfect for her as she easily gets cold even if it is not winter time... air conditioned places gives her a chill and she always equip herself with clothing like this.  I think this will be one of her favorites.  She also already tried washing it in the washing machine to test if it will be durable. Some knitted clothes would already have a wear and tear after just one wash and that sometimes the color will also fade.  But, this one did not fade nor showed any tearing.  We are very well pleased with the quality of material for which this cardigan is made of.\nI was able to get this nice product on a discount and I am happy to be able to share as well my fair and honest feedback about it.", "summary": "Comfortable and durable cardigan", "unixReviewTime": 1457395200}

I am nearing 50 years old and I go from cold to hot in the blink of an eye, so layering seems to be the best way to manage that.  Now I am under 5 feet tall so I was worried that it would be too long for me however, it wasn't too long at all. I had just assumed that the model in the photo was tall but again being under 5 feet tall, and yet the sweater fell to just below my thighs. I ordered it in the XL since I always read that most clothes need to be ordered a size larger on line than you normally would wear. I think I would have been fine ordering a large. Although it wasn't too long it was a little to big overall in the width. My mother was happy because it was then gifted to her and she loves it.  I know if I had gotten a large I would have worn it a lot. Material wise, the 30% Australian Wool--Golden Ratio wool blend was really soft and comfortable to touch and wear.  The stitching was done very neatly with no loose stitching noted. The pockets on the front were roomy and had plenty of room to carry a cell phone.  The sleeves are really cool because they just sort of float over your shoulders and a short way down the top of your arms. I had ordered the grey and I really love the color.  It looks grey in some lights but under certain lights it almost has a purple hue to it. I wouldn't hesitate to order from this company again - the quality was great.  I just think that next time I would order my true size instead of ordering up.

After a year of use, i have to say i'm extremely surprised about how great this purse is.\n\nIt has 3 main compartments, 2 with full zipper and 1 with snap button. It also has 3 inner compartments, 1 w/ zipper and the other 2 are just small pockets for things like lipsticks or hand sanitizers. This purse can fit SO MUCH! Whenever me and my husband travel together i'm one keeping all of our daily stuff with me, which includes: my own long/chunky wallet, my husband's wallet, 2 iPhone 6 plus, my makeup bag, set of keys, huge bag of wet towel, external battery, small bag of tissue, some snacks, and believe it or not, it still has space for more stuff!

The strap is at perfect length (i'm 5\"2), and the hardware (zipper/buckle) are still shinny w/o any scratches.\n\nOverall, very satisfied with this purse; very worth of the money!

One of the size 2 bridesmaids got her dress in yesterday and the breast area is above her breasts and then the stomach area is tight but everywhere else is loose. Not a good idea if you need more than one!!! I attached a photo of the orange color I revived the second time next to a pink shirt to show the difference. I also have a side by side comparison of my first dress and the second dress to show the color variation. And then a photo of two of the dresses showing variations in lace. The last photo is to show the way it looks in reality for anyone wanting to consider it. It is well made and requires no slip, but the other issues we've faced have been stressful.

We got this outfit because it was so cute and figured the open leg design would be more forgiving. And it was! Check out the pictures :)\n\nAs a mom, I really love how soft the material is and really warm.  I wouldn't send him out into cold weather with only this on, but as a cute top layer, sure.  I also like that the hood isn't tight around his neck and is super soft as well so when nap time comes around he's not so uncomfortable that he needs to be changed.  And finally, I LOVE the message! ;) We mom's need some love too!\n\nMy son really really likes the hood as well! He's in to hats lately....and pockets! So this is perfect! The pocket is one of those that goes all the way through so he ends up holding his own hand and think that's hilarious. Kids... :)\n\nSo I would recommend this to anyone with a kid 2yrs or younger.  Unless you like the jumper look like I do, if you have a taller kid, you may not be interested in this outfit.  But we like it. It's perfect for snuggling indoors and having a run around outdoors without worrying about getting the pant legs too dirty.\n\n*Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback.

The preview of this \"hoodie\" looked really nice. The characters seemed to jump off of the jersey. So much so that I actually thought that they were patches that were sewn on. NOT the case. IMO The advertised product DOES NOT live up to what was delivered.  The advertised illustration shows a rich deep purple.  The delivered product is a washed out lighter purple.  The characters are not patches or sewn on, instead they are a cheap silkscreen that looks like they will potentially wash off!!! The care instructions direct you to wash the garment inside out (I guess to keep the characters from washing off too fast?).  Additionally I was expecting what I consider a \"hoodie\".  I'm from the northeast and it gets cold in the winter.  So when I hear \"hoodie\" I think something that can be worn say to a friday night fall football game and keep your warm. This \"hoodie\" is extremely thin and is probably only good for temps in the 50's or 60's. It also stinks and needs washed. It has a pretty nasty chemical smell to it. Not sure if that's from the silkscreening process or if the thing were glued on or what. I'm almost afraid to wash it because I don't want the coveted characters to come off.  The real test will be if my kid likes it, in the end though I would not have made the investment had I know how cheaply this product was going to actually be, and would advise all other parents with kiddos who are into FNAF to look elsewhere to buy, or better yet pick out a nice thick warm hoodie and got to a place that does silkscreening and just do it yourself. It will be probably be way cheaper and look way nicer and you won't have to contend with whatever chemicals are in this thing I purchased.", "summary": "DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ~~ YWT Five Nights At Freddy S Women's Hoddie Long Sleeve Cool", "unixReviewTime": 1449705600}

I am 105 pounds, skinny waist, big hips, small bust (32A or 32AA), and 5'2\" (a.k.a pear shaped) I am a naturally tiny person, I have sloped shoulders and fair skin as well. I say this about my skin because your skin and the color of a shirt are very important. There are some colors out there that I just don't look good in! So always try to buy the color that you think would look best on you.\n\nAfter reading the reviews, I decided I would just go with the size I always go with when I'm shopping in a store. Small. I found that a small was perfect because it fit nicely around the hips and waist. And, as I was expecting, it was loose around my shoulders and obviously I'm not going to fill it out with these itty bitty titties and have a sexy cleavage. But that's okay, I don't care. It's a beautiful shirt and I love how it gives a kimono/Japanese look to your outfit. It's also perfect for nursing in. (yes, even tiny titties can produce milk).\n\nI also plan to wear some form of a tank top underneath it because it would look nice, keep me warmer, and it would keep the shirt from flashing people. I am also a seamstress so I plan to figure out a way to keep the crisscrossing fabric from slouching down or moving around so much while I wear it. I will probably gather a little more of the fabric at the waist where the wrap goes across the body and to the side and make a few stitches there.\n\nI will not deny that some people will buy their size and find it too small or too large, that's going to happen to some people, but only you know your own body, so when buying remember two things: 1. never expect to look as nice and lovely as the picture they show, think about how it would look on YOU. Try to imagine where the flaws would be. 2. buy two shirts (or whatever item you are purchasing), each in a different size. That way, you only have to return one (hopefully) and still have the right size with you and don't have to try to buy again and wait for it to arrive.\n\nHope this helps.", "summary": "There are some colors out there that I just don't look good in!

But upon opening it, it smelled very heavily of women's perfume- a coconut flavored smell. And it had a blond curly hair attached to it (mine's brown and straight). It seemed that someone else took it for quite the test drive before I received it. Even after washing and drying the garment, it still smells quite strongly of perfume.\n\nAs for the fit, I'm undecided if I'm going to be able to use it or not. It may be a little too top heavy for me, since I have a large bust and athletic shoulders. The ruching across the collarbone draws the eyes wide, so it can look more masculine if you don't have narrow shoulders. The top is tight at the waist and looser at the shoulders and chest by design. My measurements are 5'4\", 115lbs, 32DD.\n\nIt fits well, but I may be taking it in a bit with my sewing machine to get it to fit better. Otherwise, it is a good quality fabric. It's thick enough to not be see-through at all, and I think it's a good price for the top.\n\nThe sizing was correct for me, I ordered the XS in charcoal. It says to hand wash and then hang dry. I prefer lower maintenance items, and should have checked this first so be sure to take that into account. However, the tag says to machine wash and dry, which is what I did and it turned out just fine.

I have an \"hour glass\" shape where the smallest part of my waist measures 25\". In American sizes, I ALWAYS wear a size 0 or XS. I looked at the Amazon size chart (according to which, I should order an XS), but after reading other customer reviews, I decided to go up a size. I ordered a size small...but they sent me a size medium! I measured the waist of the medium skirt and it is 27\". The skirt has a high waist (over my belly button) and there is no \"give\" or elasticity in the fabric, so the size medium is actually perfect with a thick pair of leggings and sweater underneath. However, it really bothers me that 1) the size chart is so inaccurate (TWO sizes too small), and 2) the seller sent me a larger size than I ordered without asking me. This sizing problem is especially troubling because the seller is located in China and returns with international shipping would be a real pain.\n\nOther than the sizing issue, I am happy with the skirt. It is 100% wool with nylon lining (and lined pockets, too!), so it isn't itchy. The sewing is high quality and the seams, zipper, pockets, belt loops, and pleats are all in the right places with good alignment and stitching. The style of the skirt is old fashioned and I do feel a bit frumpy in it, but I expected that--it looks EXACTLY as pictured. This is a well-made, warm, 100% wool, full-length skirt and you can't beat the price ($30.99).

It is not too tight or loose. It was just right for the fit.

This bracelet definitely helps aids with that.\n\nAs I agree with the last reviewer, I wish the fish charms would have been gold-plated to match the writing, instead of silver-plated.

Not so much this one. The overall fit for me is ok, if I had arms like a monkey. I'm 6' tall, weight 190. Medium build. My sleeve length is normally 34/35. This, as you will see from the picture, comes down almost to the knuckles on my hands. The material itself has a rough feeling to it on the outside.  The way polyester did back in the 70's, before new extrusion methods were learned. And it's also shiny like the polyester of old. So it's a blend of cotton, spandex and polyester, which makes it doubtful the sleeves will shrink enough for me to be able to ever wear it.  I will say this though, aside from the sleeves being too long, the shirt does fit well. It has the right length in the body, it is slim in design. That part they did get right. If you rolled up the sleeves, or have really long arms, this would make a good shirt for working around the home or outside in, as it seems very durable, almost like rip stop. . This would be good for that. Oh, and the inside of the shirt is softer than that of the outside too.\n\n I did receive this product at a discounted price, for an unbiased and honest review.

It also felt average on your skin. I like to dress relaxed casual when I go out, so I fancied this shirt with a nice pair of pants for a weekend out. This shirt doesn't look good enough for a night out, a good gym/weekday run around shirt for sure though.\n\nFit:\nEverything from Emiqude that was Large, fit me - I'm always usually a Large. This shirt was too big, the sleeves were all the way down to my knuckles (good 3 inches too long). I think a Medium would fit me well, I recommend ordering a size smaller. Also I didn't like how the opening around the neck looked. It lay weird on me but it could just be that I have wide/flat shoulders. Perhaps if you have shoulders that gradually increase in height as you get to the neck, it will lay properly on you.\n\nOverall it's not a terrible shirt, the only reason I'm returning because the size is wrong.

This Emiqude Mens Slim Fit Long Sleeve fit was a little large. I bought him both the XL and XXL because with many other brands, the sleeves are too short. This actually wasn't the case for the XL on him, which was awesome! Not a big deal for the XXL, he'll just push the sleeves up. It has an athletic type material, breathable so body heat doesn't get trapped in. It was made pretty well, but there were loose threads that needed to be trimmed and buttons needed to be tightened, nothing major. He's 6' 4\" and it's a nice material, stretchy and forgiving. The style is fun and can be easily worn for multiple occasions. He doesn't find the material to be too shiny or have a weird feel like others have mentioned.  Overall he's impressed with the shirt and very happy with it, considering I ordered it without him being able to try on - something we rarely do. The only reason we gave it 4 stars over 5 was because of the price and the XL was bigger than expected.\n\nThank you Emiqude, for providing this shirt to us at a discount in exchange for our honest review.

I wanted this style for myself and for my younger daughters. The black frame is what first catches your attention, they are edgy cat eyes. Definitely more rock than your average sunglasses. The lenses are a reflective gold finish. These are non-polarized lenses. The frames are made of a sturdy plastic. The earpieces are wide enough apart that they don't apply excessive pressure to your temples. They are 5 inches wide at their narrowest (the ear end of the earpiece) and 6 inches wide at their widest (the face end of the earpiece). These sunglasses provide ample UV protection and aid me in preventing my sunlight-induced migraines. I would definitely purchase these again should I lose these.\n\nPROS:\nUnique design\nFun color options\nGreat UV protection\nDoesn't apply excessive pressure to your temples\n\nCONS:\nNone experienced\n\nRatings (Out of five stars):\nSize: \nStyle: \nComfort: \nUV Protection: \nValue: \n\nOverall rating: 25 out of 25 stars / 5 Star Average\n\nI hope you enjoyed this review.

Of course you can still cut it, but the main reason I bought these was use as a deterrent and to keep the bags from inadvertently OPENING if for some reason the zippers failed. I also like that ONE strap covers all sides of the bag. All-in-all, I really like the design and features of this luggage strap.

I'm just disappointed that it didn't fit the bust even at a size smaller than what I had ordered.

I am going to keep it and wear it but it does not close all the way but I will keep it as an over shirt for layering.\n\nI thought this top had long sleeves and that is kind of my fault since the size chart has the sleeve length I just didn't measure. This fits like a 3/4 sleeve top. I can button just under my bust and that works but this is not even close to closing on my hips which measure 58 inches. If you notice the size chart does not give you a hip measurement and the fabric has no give.\n\nOverall I am not completely pissed with my purchase and would even recommend this dress for someone who has the option of going up at least one size.", "summary": "Go up a size if your hips are wider then your bust.", "unixReviewTime": 1460937600}

I placed the order and this was shipped to me quickly. This material is lightweight but still high enough quality to be a durable piece to wear on a regular basis. I am usually a size medium and I ordered this in a size 12 and it fits me great. I really like the way that this looks with the belt, but you can wear it without the belt too for a more lax sort of look. I have washed this once and I did not notice anything falling apart of fading. The color is very soft and feminine and I think that when the fall comes around, I will be wearing this a lot with boots. It sort of reminds me of a modern day trench coat. What I like most about this is that I can pair it with a skirt for a classy look at work, or even jeans for a more elegant/modern/sporty look. This was a good find and I am really happy with this.

The gray one didn't ship from Amazon so it took longer but there were some physical differences compared to the ones that came in the two pack. The gray one had a less fuzzy suede tag (C.C) in a reddish brown color - the tag on the teal and beige one is much softer and in my opinion a nicer shade of brown. The gray hat's C.C tag just looks a bit cheaper. The gray beanie was also a bit smaller than the other two and didn't contain a care label inside like the others do. The softness of the knit is about the same in all of them. They all aren't very slouchy but still pretty cute.

I use this for grocery-shopping when I need to be on a bike.\n\nOh and the strap - at least my left one: CONTINUOUSLY loosens on its own.  The metal rectangle that holds it in place (where you tighten) keeps turning/rotating 90% so it loosens the entire strap and will NOT tighten.  I have to fix it almost 2 out of 3 times I use this bag (even briefly for 1-2 hours each time).

I bought this item before, which is here:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GOJXY0O/.\n\nNot to mention impressively reasonable price, quality of the product itself is also impressive. The product is light, soft and beautifully silk-screened. It is perfect for spring and early autumn or even cool summer evening. It does not observe water quickly but does dry quickly enough.\n\nThe length of the scarf is not long as shown on the model. You definitely cannot use it as a shawl. If you are 165 cm tall or about 5 5, it will fall flat, tight, and short with an infinity loop. If draping, ; it is long enough to drape generously but short enough to blend it into a dressy blouse and make it look like it is a part of the blouse.\n\nThat was my first purchase. Overall impression was excellent and I decided to order the second one in order to test the consistency and write a review.\n\nSecond purchase was made here:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B016NQ5XCO\n\nThe 2nd purchase was disappointing. While my view on the product has not changed much, my purchase experience as whole was not that great.\n\nFor the second purchase, initial item they sent was a wrong colour: black-and-white instead of khaki (see the 1st and 2nd photo). Seller responded promptly but claimed that actual colours are slightly different. But as you can see in the photo, they are not slightly different as in colour you see on the monitor is not exactly same as the color you see in person. They were completely different colours: red-brown vs black-and-white.\n\nI did not want refund but replacement, to which they agreed. It took a couple of months, but I did get a replacement. However, again, it was a wrong color.\n\nFor this series of blunder, I put down Caveat emptor. Yoyorule product lost four stars from me. But their reasonable price, relatively consistent quality of product itself, and superb customer service got a few stars back.\n\nTo suffice, if you do not care what colour you receive, you will be satisfied with the price and quality of the product, not to mention customer service.\n\nThis product is listed under different / renewed sellers on Amazon, but they seem to be the same business.

I got this because I wanted something a little bit different that no one really had around here. I like the style of the wayfarers but I don't want to be like everyone else and get the exact same kind. When I was in Hawaii I noticed people had wooden sunglasses and I thought they're pretty awesome so I started doing some research. I picked up these because they're made of bamboo which I thought was even more awesome very stylish and yet very different at the same time. It was a little off putting that these arrived in just a plastic baggie but they did include carrying bag and a microfiber cloth. I was little hesitant because I thought that maybe damage but they weren't thankfully. When you first pull out the glasses You can feel the smoothness in that bamboo the legs are made out you can tell legitimately that they are made of real bamboo. The frames fit perfectly around my face which is generally hard because it's not easy to find frames that my nose. Overall I am very satisfied with this product and will probably end up buying another pair but in a different style.

The high polish on the band, combined with the concave shape gives the diamonds a really brilliant look, but it's not a blingy ring.  This is a substantial band, with some thickness.  The inside of the band is not hollowed out. It's solid. The band doesn't taper. The borders have rounded, but very distinct edges. This ring has a silk fit, so it's very comfortable to wear. It's a beauty. I especially like it paired with a solitare ring.\n\nI highly recommend D-Gold, if looking for quality diamond rings set with the smaller stones. I have no affiliation with this seller....other than being a loyal customer.  So often, diamonds set in silver are poor quality, with unattractive to downright ugly stones...especially at this price point.  Thanks D-Gold, I'm impressed. I appreciate your excellent quality at low prices.", "summary": "Excellent Quality", "unixReviewTime": 1329523200}

This is sure to make you feel beautiful and your partner will go crazy to see you in this sexy number.

This wrap has some real highlights as well as a couple of drawbacks, but it's a solid 4 star item.\n\n----The lace is smooth, and not scratchy like tulle netting.  If you set this robe down on a chair, it would slither to the floor in the way that smooth satin does.  It's a slippery kind of lace that doesn't get caught on things that easily, including my many rings.\n\n----It's hits at the knee for me, and I'm 5'6\".  I wear a US Women's Medium in most things, and ordered a Medium here, and the fit is good.\n\n----The best part about this robe is the eyelash lace trim, which runs along the cuffs of the 3/4 sleeves, and along the entire front opening.  It's a nice touch that makes this robe look more upscale. (See photos.)\n\n----However, it really would have been nice if the eyelash lace ran along the bottom hem.  It's a shame that the bottom hem is just straight across, because the addition of the eyelash trim would have elevated this robe up to 5 stars.\n\n----The only part I don't like is the satin belt/belt loops.  They used the stiff, papery kind of satin, rather than the kind that has a liquid drape to it.  So that takes away from the luxuriousness slightly.  I actually prefer to wear the robe open though--like a beach coverup.  I might have to remove the satin belt loops though.\n\n----The bra and thong are throwaways for me.  The string thong is so flimsy, it could be an eyepatch, and the bra was much too big around the non-adjustable string band. (Several inches too big, actually.)  If I had the patience to alter the bra, I would keep it, because it's actually very pretty---it's a simple halter with triangle cups, but it's nice, were it not for the giant band.\n\nI'd love to see a full length version of this--I'd definitely buy that.  Floor length would make a big impact.  But this is pretty too, and if you're a fan of the boho vibe that you see from Anthropologie or Free People, there's no reason why you couldn't wear this outdoors as an open kimono.  I like it, and plan to wear it through the summer festival season.\n\n---Promotional sample provided for the purpose of candid and objective review.---", "summary": "The eyelash lace cuffs are the best part.", "unixReviewTime": 1466985600}

I could have probably gone with a medium and still been fine. The material is very soft and comfortable, love the shirt. I was a little disappointed in the picture though; the colors aren't as vibrant as it shows, but I figure that's just because of my monitor. Love the shirt overall, just wish it would have been a little bit brighter and more crisp of a picture. Color also comes off under the arms. I thought this was only going to happen after first wear because it was brand new, however it has been washed and is still turning my arms black underneath, just luckily the sleeves are long enough to cover this up while wearing it. Hopefully the color will stop rubbing off after a few more washes.\nFollow up: After multiple washes, color is still coming off on my arms as well as my bra, which has now been stained and ruined with the dye from the shirt.

My teen girls both say these gloves fit them just fine. They are into vintage and the swing style clothing. These gloves will be a nice addition to their dance costumes.\n\nSome of the things I likes about the gloves:\nThey are well made and reinforced where expected.\nThey are made from a soft, comfortable knit material.\nThey keep your hands nice and warm.\n\nThe only thing I have for a con is the odor. This may fade with time and more laundering. Right out of the package, the fur has a chemical smell that did lighten with one washing but is still noticeable.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this review.

Not very girly girly, but still fun and flirty. This is a very cute accessory to add to your collection. I don't think that I will run this through the washer at all, with the metal that it has.

So, like any amazon buyer, I hit the reviews and see what people have to say. Lets face it, reviews in the digital age mean everything! It's not like you can just head on down to the neighborhood store and return your item! So, the first thing that I read was that this tunic ran too small. I ordered a size large. I am 5'7\" and weigh about 135. Typically I order medium and it fits me well. The large fit me absolutely perfectly. I means, even if it were a bit large (which it wasn't) it wouldn't matter, because it's a tunic and they are meant to be loose! it hugs you tighter around your chest and then flows out, which in my opinion is very flattering on all body types. It certainly hide the fact that I have had three children! I'll tell you that for sure. the neckline was also amazing! Loved it in fact! I hate getting necklines that are too wide and too low, leaving you no options but to wear a cami underneath. I know that that's the way clothing is worn anymore, but frankly I don't love wearing more clothing that I have to. Next the fabric is not sheer. You do not have to wear a shirt beneath your s***, because this shirt (even the white which is what I got) is not see through! It's a soft stretch cotton material! Match this bad boy with some leggings and I am telling you, it's like being in your pajama's! Seriously, I am going to order one in each color! The price is a steal as well. I mean I can't find this quality of construction, fit, ect for this price anywhere. If I were Oprah, I'd put this on my \"favorite things\" list. I can't say enough. Just order one size larger than you would in American sizes, and you will never regret this purchase. Trust me.", "summary": "I find it very hard to find clothing through amazon that I actually like.

Still, the style looked so great--that sweet spot between man-tailored and feminine--that I finally ordered it.  When it arrived, I loved it, except for one fatal flaw.\n\nPros:\n\n*It wasn't nearly as sheer as I feared it would be.  A good camisole would have made it decent for the general public.\n\n*The material felt silky-nice.\n\n*For the price, though the shirt clearly wasn't fine tailored, the cut looked just as shown.  I prepared for happiness.\n\nCons:\n\n*But here was the fatal flaw: the sleeves were unattractively scrawny, too short and too tight, as if cut for a smaller, shorter person. The picture shows them scrunched up, but they weren't all that scrunchable. They also weren't long enough or wide enough to be rolled up attractively.  And though the end of the sleeves were just like regular long sleeves, with a button closure, they clearly weren't meant to be full long sleeves either.  They ended about 2 inches above my wrist.  I tried it on 3 times, to see if I could live with it, but for me, the sleeves were unworkable.\n\n*Also, except for the scrawny sleeves, the rest of the shirt is pretty big.  I'd normally be a large medium, like a 10 or 12, but the 6 was a bit large, not too large to be a deal breaker, but I'd recommend ordering a size smaller than your usual size.\n\nI'm tall with long arms, so I'm guessing the scrawny arm problem won't apply to everyone.

Fits perfect on smaller breast, not sure how well this would fit on someone with more than a C cup, I'm assuming it wouldn't hold much weight, unless you use the ties to make a halter.\n\nThe bottoms looked huge taking out of the box, they sit a little bit higher in front and back than most of my bottoms but I'm just glad that my bottom is covered. I was worried about the metal rings in place of strings, if you need some extra room you could always cut the metal ring and use the extra ties it comes with to make a string bikini out of it. Luckily I didn't have to, but it would be an easy fix.\n\nIt came with extra padding for the cups, I'm assuming to add a push up effect but I don't believe theres enough support in the band to accomplish that, maybe if you used the ties it came with to make a halter.\n\nThe material is not like any bikini I own, it doesn't look like the print and color will hold up after sun exposure.\n\nOverall I love this bikini for the price, if I get 5 wears out of it I'll be happy. I reluctantly included pictures to give you an idea of what it looks like on an average body. I hope this was helpful.", "summary": "Can't believe this worked out!", "unixReviewTime": 1475193600}

I like the fact that I can use the brush insert or choose not to. It has two elastic pouches so I can put whatever I want in them. I put two big brushes in one side and my toothbrush and toothpaste in the other pouch. I love the depth of the bottom part. 3 inches.  It is deep enough for my powder jars and all of my tubes of cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen. I also use product in small bottles and there is room for them to lay down in the case. I put a mirror face down in the bottom of the bag then put my things on top of it. I like the size of this case. It fits easily in my suitcase/bag. I looked at bigger ones but I am very happy with this size. I could put more in this case if I needed to. I only use it laying down so I don't use the handle. I would love a handle on the top instead of the side but that doesn't change my opinion. I enjoy using this case. Very happy with it!

It had her card and alittle petite card for you to write on. Mind you, I did not pay for gift wrap either. She does this free of cost, so remember that when ordering. No need to choose wrapping, she takes it upon herself to do so. It also came in a little tiny bag that was so precious.  You have got to go under this designer/artists name to see her jewelry!!!

To be honest I have had so many different travel bags and somehow I always end up using zip lock bags to take my goodies.  Not very pretty but practical.  But I saw this bag and decided to kick it up a notch. And I am glad I did.  I was reading from other reviews how small it is........it is but if you are using small containers and traveling with just enough and not a lot of excess (which I tend to to anyway) this bag will hold a lot of stuff.  The fabric is practical, durable and washable.  I think with all the weight restrictions on the airlines now less is sometimes best.  I cannot tell you how many times I have had to remove things from my bag because of the weight and it usually because of the heavy toiletries.  This bag will hold all your small items and it is convenient with two zippered pouches, two pockets and a nice deep pocket.  This would be perfect for backpacking or any day hikes also.  An over nigher....perfect.  For me I ALWAYS take to much so this bag makes me think twice about the excess I always pack.\n\nI received this toiletry pouch at a discount for an honest review.  Durable fabric/easily washable for any spills or soils.  Very pretty looks just like the photos.  Zipper seems well made and durable.  Very glad I had the opportunity to review this product.

I went on a 1 month trip around India and I knew I needed to have very organized bags so I could keep track of everything. This little pouch was a life saver! I've included 2 pics - one so you can see all the pouches and size of the bag (my 19 pound Boston Terrier is sleeping next to them) and another with a close up of the handle and adorable zipper pulls.\n\nPros:\n-It is made for cosmetics but is really quite versatile. I found it held medicines quite well. I also used one for food on my carry-on.\n-It is a very cute color. I have 2 different colors and since they stand apart from each other it is easy to know which bag to grab. That helped a lot and kept me from shifting all over my bag looking for items.\n-It has a removable sleeve that is perfect for holding small items like makeup brushes or lipstick. This can be removed because it is just attached with velcro. I removed it for this trip because I was trying to use as little weight as possible, but I am saving them for use on future trips.\n-It has a net pouch on the top. I found this very useful! I like being able to separate some things for easier access and still being able to see them easily.\n-It has a handle on the outside and very cute zipper pulls (see pic).\n\nCons:\n-None so far! And I used them a lot. In fact I think I may end up buying more colors down the road.\n\nAnything else of note?:\n-I received this product for testing and review. I recognize that a review of a discounted product is something fundamentally different from that of a product for which one has paid full price, but I do believe that such reviews can be useful when the process is respected, and I've tried to do that here.", "summary": "Absolutely wonderful...and such a cute color!", "unixReviewTime": 1460851200}

It is NOT see through (unless you buy it skin tight and two sizes too small because obviously you will be stretching it to the max and allowing it to be see through), lovely color (got the dark red), goes past my knee (I am 5'3\") and extremely adorable on!  I ordered a size small, normally wear a 4-6US.  It fits perfectly, its not to tight or loose.  I was thinking of buying a medium (due to the reviews) but super glad I went with the small.  Medium would have been to baggy in the waist.  I think the sizes are true US sizes.  I would get what you normally would wear (just my two cents!).  :)\n\nI promise you cannot go wrong with this dress for the price.  Its just plain old adorable!!  Very pleased with it.  Note- material is stretchy-ish like a normal polyester/cotton blend so if you do screw up on the size there is wiggle room.", "summary": "LOVE. What can I say", "unixReviewTime": 1452470400}

It was a little deceiving.  I realize it was done to protect the main material, however the folding and turning it inside out had a tendency to cause wrinkling on the front of the dress.\n\nOverall the dress appears to be a quality dress.  The main issue was with the mesh on top and the beading.  Those two components of the dress made it feel cheap and not of high quality; but what can you expect from a $46 dress.\n\nAdditionally, the dress is way too long.  I ordered a small based on the size chart and the dress fit perfectly.  However, the length was for someone 6 inches taller than my wife.  She's about 5'4\".  So, if you're about that same height then you will likely need to have the dress altered.  I didn't have time to alter the dress.\n\nFinally, the ribbon that is supposed to be used to tie the back was not finished on both ends.  Since it is supposed to hang out after being tied you would expect it to have a finished look but it doesnt.\n\nOverall, it is a decent dress for the price but could be better.", "summary": "Decent for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1492041600}

It's such a beautiful piece, and extremely well made. The navy blue color is perfect for any outfit, and it even comes with both a shoulder strap and wristlet to accommodate your needs or wants. You can fit your phone in one of the 3 compartments, and pack in everything you might need for a night out. It comes with : 3 main compartments, 6 card slots, 1 invisible zippered pocket inside for your coins, and 1 outside pocket. All of that in one very sleek and convenient clutch, or shoulder bag if you choose to add the shoulder strap. This is a stylish piece that is extremely functional. It makes the perfect gift , or if you just want to treat yourself to something you know you will use. This is my all time favorite clutch I own! I can't believe the value you are getting when you buy this piece. As a beauty & fashion junkie/blogger and reviewer, I am confident in giving this 5 stars.

I am really impressed by the quality and the coloring of this clutch. It is a dark navy and under certain light conditions, you can see the bright tint of blue. The color is certainly unique and is both understated in low light but super stunning in bright light. I really like the versatility and chameleon-feel of this clutch.\n\nI enjoy the crocodile leather pattern on the front flap as it gives the clutch a unique accent, a contrast to the rest of the smooth leather texture. The quality of the leather isn't the best, considering this is made from split leather materials but considering the reasonable price, this is really a steal. There is a sheen to the leather that seems slightly unnatural, but once you feel and smell it, the leather quality comes through. If you want to give this leather a more natural look to it, I suggest buffing it using a leather conditioner for a more matte look.\n\nI think my favorite part of this clutch/wristlet is its sheer amount of storage space. There are four separate compartments to store all you need. I love the different compartments because it makes it so much simpler to organize your items. There is a zipper that unzips to reveal two compartments and a third zippered compartment.\n\nOne compartment is perfect for storing your wallet and your cards and has a sewn-in tiered card holder. The middle compartment is zippered and is perfect for storing small items and coins. The third compartment has an extra zippered compartment to store receipts or thin items in addition to your smartphone or iPhone. There is also an extra compartment if you open the front flap for any additional items. I seriously love the amount of pockets this clutch has! The clutch is about 8.5 x 5.5 x 1 but the depth can be stretched depending on how many things you can stuff inside it. The compartments are large enough so you can fit an iPhone 6 Plus or a Samsung Galaxy S6 in it, though I don't think itll fit a larger phone such as a Note or a tablet.\n\nThe product also contains two interchangeable straps, a long shoulder strap if you want to use it as a purse and a smaller wrist strap if you want to use this as a wristlet. You can also take off all the straps and use this as a clutch.\n\nI feel that this product is extremely versatile and flexible and is the perfect accessory for all occasions. It can be used while you're dressed up or down in three different styles while still being able to store the maximum amount of items. This makes such a great purse, a wonderful clutch, and a stylish wristlet all in one package. I received this clutch from Belfen for use and testing and this is my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Stylish with Maximal Storage Compartments! Love this!", "unixReviewTime": 1447200000}

This is an item that is mass-produced by a huge Chinese clothing manufacturer, which is why you see it (and many other items) being sold by many different Amazon sellers, with the same photos but different description. So be aware that it will arrive without tags, and possibly smelling a little strong from storage/shipping. Not something that bothers me, but may bother some people.\n\nPROS: The shirt is true to the measurements listed in the product description. For reference, I normally wear an XS/2 in women's, and a size 30DD bra -- my overbust is 35.5\", underbust 29.5\", waist 25\". I ordered the S size here, and thought the fit was close to the picture (though the armpits are a bit baggy for my taste). The photos here were taken before I washed the shirt -- I expect it will shrink a bit in the wash. The fabric is soft, comfortable and reasonably well-stitched - it reminds me of an American Rag henley I tried on at Macy's not too long ago.\n\nCONS: The fabric itself is stretchy and overly pliant - it's the kind of material that gets looser and looser throughout the day as you wear it. The neckline is unfortunately too low for me to feel comfortable bending over - it gapes considerably and flaps open at the notch. I'm also kind of disappointed in the color; the photo looks darker/more ashy than what I received.\n\nOVERALL: Cheap, loose, basic t-shirt. Comparable fabric to overpriced department store brands. Looks cute, but isn't worth paying more than $5-10, in my cheap-ass humble opinion. Sorry for the crappy pictures.", "summary": "As pictured", "unixReviewTime": 1451692800}

I have many watches including automatics like this one.  I also have another same brand K&S watch that looks well and also works well for a inexpensive all Chinese watch. .  This one however is just terrible.  For starters it didn't work out of the box.  After winding it as instructed, then moving it around to get the rotor moving, and pulling the crown in and out, the second hand would not move.  Before I gave up, I rapped it a couple of times into the palm of my hand. Meaning I hit my hand not an object.  On the third rap, it started to work.\n\nAfter taking a closer look I found serval major condition issues and have outlined them in the attached images.  First the lume dots on the hour markers all off center.  Some are on one side while others are on the other side of the center.  It is very obvious even at arms length.  The case had two deep scores or scratches on the back.  Finally the gold plating job is just terrible.  You can see either the plating bubbling or the case was poorly cast.  I may have been able to live with one of these issues, but not all four.  Because it was stuck when new, I felt it would fail prematurely.\n\nThat said, I liked the look enough to send this back and order a replacement. I believe every product can come defective and I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.  So I will update this review when I get it. But if it comes the same way, this review will stay the same.\n\nImages are included for your review.

If I didn't know any better I would think they simply put the \"XL\" label on an \"XS\" garment and shipped it. When I first bought it I thought it was prime, I wouldn't have ordered it otherwise. That was my mistake. It took weeks to get here, and after I tried it on and it was HORRIBLE, I found out I had to pay to return it. So I can either spend about as much to ship it back as I did on the original item, or just have an incredibly tight shirt I guess I can wear to sleep in. My fiance thinks it's sexy - because it's skin tight - so I guess that's the silver lining...

It has very crisp lines and the stitching is very well done and has two features that only my highest quality ties have.  Fist the back side of the tip and tail are lined with matching fabric for a completely finished look, some of my other ties are either not backed or use a lesser quality fabric.  Second the folds are held together with two rows of doubled stitching at both the tip and tail rather than just a single on some of my other ties. There is no logo on the tie itself, the only marking is a small black tag on the tail that says 100% silk.

Packaging was nice to prevent any damage and the gloves were well protected.\nThe seller said that the packaging shown in the video was improved even better. Complete comfort from inside to out. Both inside and out are so soft and lightweight. I personally do not like heavy really thick gloves, it makes my hands feel so restricted and it's annoying to me. Surprisingly, I didn't have this issue with these... They fit \"Like a glove\" without being too tight or loose. Perfect fit. They felt very natural on and lightweight, but yet still very warm for cold TX days.\n\nSo sorry, I completely forgot to mention in the video that the leather is so so soft!\nI mean, buttery soft!!! So supple!\nFeels like expensive quality leather. No bad scent, just the scent of good quality leather. Not overpowering. The seller said the leather is sheepskin, however if I'm not mistaken with sheepskin it's insulated with wool on the inside I think. I believe the leather may be lambskin. I'm very surprised that you can get REAL TOP QUALITY leather gloves for this price. The cashmere is a bonus!\nDefinitely makes a wonderful gift as they are low in cost and someone will think you paid a lot more since it's leather and good quality;)\n\nDisclaimer:\n*Sample provided at a discounted price or at no cost in exchange for my 100% honest review. I am not paid to give a positive review nor do I guarantee a positive review. Please do not down vote just because I was offered to review, I personally wouldn't want you to spend your hard earned money on something bad, just as I wouldn't want to:)", "summary": "Beautiful gloves!", "unixReviewTime": 1449878400}

The bonus is for me has certainly been the quality of the fabric and stitching  things you can not really tell with just pictures.\n\nMy granddaughter is five and I got a size 6.  It fits her perfect.  I would suggest going up one size to be on the safe side in my case that worked.  The inside of the hooded sweatshirt is ultra soft making it a easy sell to my granddaughter. I love the unique 3D effect of the bunny face.  The dark color is as always a plus to hide stains.  One great feature I was impressed with is there are no strings on the hat part like I typically see.  These in my opinion can be a bother and really unneeded.  All the stitching is tight and flawless.\n\nUpon arrival the hooded sweatshirt came tightly bound in durable plastic shrink wrap.  I like the protection of this to keep it safe in transit.  I noticed no smell when unwrapped.  I laundered it without any change in the quality.  I will say that it would be nice if they would include instructions on washing it in English along with the Japanese writing it contains on the label.  The pockets are a favorite for my granddaughter to store things in.  This has turned out to be her new favorite hooded sweatshirt which makes me a happy grandma.\n\nI received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Warm, soft and cute!", "unixReviewTime": 1454630400}

The elastic keeps them in place and prevents them from slipping off. The sole is thin which allows my little one to walk with confidence. It's as close to being barefoot as she can get, which I like.\n\nThey have been through a month and half of wear and tear from an active toddler (lots of outdoor use in the sun, rain, dirt, everywhere!) and while they did lose their luster quickly (the bottoms are also really dirty), they still work pretty well.

Long story short he LOVED it! I did too but probably not as much as him.\n\nFirst of all it looks a little different than it does in the picture. Mainly the top actually covered my body more which is something I really liked. The panties however were a complete different story... the \"crotch-less\" part looked like it was done with a pair of scissors real quick so that would definitely make me knock off a star on the rating but I don't really care about panties in general when wearing such lingerie so it's not THAT big of a deal to me just know it's a little different than pictured.\n\nOverall I liked this, really liked it. I have never worn something with an open cup like this before so I was a little hesitant with it but it ended up being quite comfortable and like I said...he LOVED it! It was super soft to the touch too. I saw another review say something about comparing it to Victoria Secret, well let me tell you I'm actually allergic to Victoria Secret and Fredrick's of Hollywood. The products from there usually give me a rash which isn't unheard of actually, but the point I'm getting at is that this particular product here didn't give me an allergic reaction at all so that's a definite plus to me!\n\nI recommend this to anyone looking to spice up the bedroom. I'm a 34B and it fit great, I think that it'll fit anyone because it's stretchy where it needs to be and there's actually a lot of material to it so it should fit anyone of any size.\n\nI received this product free in exchanged for an unbiased and honest review.", "summary": "He says give it 5 stars!", "unixReviewTime": 1450396800}

This is a really sexy outfit and the baby doll is made of this really soft material that feels amazing on your skin.  The material is a soft mesh, so its pretty sheer, but it really is super soft.  I absolutely love when lingerie is made of that really soft material as it feels great on your skin and just makes you feel beautiful; or at least it does me!

This, combined with designer's seeming refusal to make functional pockets on women's jeans has lead to some, let's just say innovative solutions for keeping my money and ID on me in these spaces. My normal wallet is a bit on the bulky side and sometimes I just want to pare it down a bit for the night.\n\nThis nice little wallet is exactly right for those occasions, It holds 4 cards a zippered compartment for coins or cash and an ID window. It also has a magnet clip for cash but there's absolutely no way I'd trust it to hold anything, it's a decently sized magnet, but if you stuck folded money in there it would definitely weaken it too much to hold itself shut firmly. I think if you want a cash clip you should probably always use a metal one or just rubber band it to your wallet or phone. I don't use cash clips so the whole magnet issue doesn't bother me one way or another. I'm not sure I even like the idea of magnets so close to my credit cards, so I might just remove it and make the whole wallet even thinner.\n\nThe leather is soft and flexible and the overall thinness of this wallet is fantastic. I can fit it comfortably even in my tiny pockets or in shoes or bras (all classic going to concert hiding spots), and it also helps compact things when I'm dressing up and using a small clutch bag too.

The way the card holder feels, you can tell it's made with care and it's true to its word; LEATHER. Most companies when they say leather it's not real BUT this is. When feeling it, it has that smooth leather feeling and the smell is beautiful!! One last thing I love the most about this card holder is this; the snap at the back. It's perfect for holding cash if you have just a little cash you ended up with. It's snaps perfectly good and is very secure. If you don't have cash, you can use it to click the card holder to your pocket or bag. Over all it's an amazing product and is such high quality and made with such care that I would definitely have to say this company thinks of their customers when making these.

Everything else arrived on time at least.\nSo, it finally came today, 1/2/2017.\nI was looking forward to trying it on. So I could wear it into work tomorrow. But that won't be the case.\nTried it on and first thing I noticed was it was tight in the shoulders. Which already tells me this isn't going to work out well. Then the smell kicked in. It's a strange chemical smell, I just can't place. Kind if like watered down gasoline.\nThen I tried to zip it up and the zipper wasn't wanting to go up. It finally went up after some fidgeting. Got to about my chest area and it became supper tight. Which I knew it would already, after the shoulders were to tight.\nThis is meant for more of a ectomorph body style. Us Vbods know this disappointment all to well.\nIt is a nice jacket however. Clean look and warm. The top zippers are just for show. But the top pockets are functional. Same with the inside pocket and the two on the sides. That's a first, for a made in China product. Least the ones I've been ordering from. So that's a huge plus.\nIf you are of slender build, you will fit perfectly in this jacket.\nI'm giving it 2 stars because of the sizing, after following the chart, and the chemical smell.\nHopefully you'll make an \"American\" XL cut of this jacket soon.", "summary": "Strange chemical smell and to small in chest area", "unixReviewTime": 1483315200}

If small, then that means you want it to stay locked on there. Which means you'll have a hard time undoing your jeans. But you get the point. They're slim and fit great.\n\nAnd for the zippers from the legs of your side pockets, they will tend to be a little more slimmer. So you will have a bit of a difficulty bending down all the way or whatever. But of course, it all depends on your POV. I'm not a stubborn person like everyone else. And I am truly honest with all of this and I honestly don't have any issues with these jeans. They're not too tight and they're not too big.

Patches sewn incorrectly and they flip flopped the Army so it's on the bottom and the round patch is on the top which looks horribly out of place. Furthermore, there is loose stitching everywhere on this coat and bunching where the hood was sewn on. Because of this the hood is not securely attached and will fail. Although I appreciate this seller's prompt response they did not offer a return. They told me the shipping was way too much to send back and would not refund my entire purchase.

The fleece on the inside is decent but pretty thin and it only covers about 3 inches of the bottom of the hat. For another .04$ or so they could have covered the entire inside with fleece and had a fairly warm hat but the stitch on top is loose enough that it doesn't stop the wind so the top of your head is cold while your ears are warmish. The hat is also really long so you either pull it all the way down practically covering your eyes or you wear it up and have unflattering cone head. It's definitely not the worst hat I have ever seen but for 25$ this thing should be amazing quality and it just isn't. I hate leaving bad reviews, in fact, I have done hundreds of reviews and there are only a handful of 3 stars but I couldn't in good conscience tell people that this hat is worth the money when it isn't.

I am always on the go with lots of things I carry with me. I have a toddler and I work on the go. I needed something that has plenty of room but I did not want to carry a bigger purse. I thought this backpack would do the trick.\n\nThe backpack had a slight smell when I opened it but is dissipated quickly. The material seems to be nylon and very strong. The quality of this and the way it is designed makes me think this will hold up for a long time. The two straps on the back are adjustable like any typical backpack. There is also a stylish flap that covers the zippered parts on the outside. It fastens with magnetic snaps that lie under leather straps.\n\nThe backpack has plenty of storage. There is a main zippered pocket that is the largest section of the backpack. Inside that pocket is a padded flap to separate a laptop or tablet from other items inside. There is a hidden small zippered pocket on the inside and 2 open pouches that a cell phone would fit in. On the outside front part of the bag is another smaller zippered area. This space is plenty big enough for a standard notebook to fit in with extra space.
