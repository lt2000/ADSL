Other than that, it is a good size.  It has the perfect amount of room to fit an ipad.  My mac will only fit in it vertically but sticks out.  It is heavy but sturdy.  The strap is adjustable.  The metal clips for the straps are thick and silver, which actually makes the bag even more classy.  The clip to adjust the length of the strap has the Harvey name engraved in it.  Quality seems great.  Haven't had it long enough to test its durability.  Will have to write back in a couple months or so.

I appreciated the webbing is a little larger, so it wasn't a really tight fit for the can, but can hold a slightly larger water bottle too. Perfect!\n\nPic #2 = In the main pouch I have my 15-inch laptop, my 10-inch tablet w/case, two(2) trade paperback books, two(2) mice in the extra zipper pocket, plus a full bag of sunflower seeds. There is still lots of room to add more items in the main part of the bag. Awesome!\n\nPic #3 = Rear pocket. You can fit an 8-inch tablet in this pocket or other knick-nacks. It's a good size too.\n\nPic #4 = The middle pocket is thinner than the main pocket but longer than the rear pocket. I have a camera, pockets for other things, and my 10-inch tablet again. The pocket is deep and is great for a notebook for school.\n\nPic #5 = another view of the main pocket down to the bottom. You can see it spread out to allow for a couple of thick text books, in addition to the laptop pocket on the left of the picture.\n\nPic #6 = Zippers have double-stitching and a nice glowy pull string on the end end of the zipper. The nice long pull strings make it easier to open and close the zippers.\n\nPic #7 = Front has the breathable material between your back and the backpack. Also two molle, one on each strap if you want to hang items from it or find another connector to strap across your chest.\n\nPic #8 = Top handle, so you can carry this when it's not feasible to sling it over your back/shoulders.\n\nPic #9 = The handle and straps have extra thick sewing on the inside holding it and the backpack together. I appreciate the extra effort to ensure these items don't split easily. Thank you!\n\nPic #10 = Buckles have extra stitching on the strap too, especially if one is pulling to tighten and release the strap. Good job!\n\nPic #11 = I laid the backpack down in a small puddle for 5 minutes to test if it is in fact waterproof.\nI had a paper towel in each compartment. They were all dry except where I had the zipper was exposed, as there isn't a fold over flap for the middle and rear pockets like the main compartment has a flap. Thus some moisture seeped in. It's enough protection going between classes that your stuff will stay dry in these two other pockets, but having the extra material flap over the zipper on all pockets would be an area of improvement. Otherwise, there is a 'plastic' barrier lining the inside of the pockets and bottom, making this in fact fairly waterproof, not just water resistant. Though it would not hurt to spray this pack with some water resistant spray, just in case. Impressive!\n\nOVERALL: It's a simple backpack that holds more than it looks, has great attention to the stitching and zippers and will save your equipment if you get caught in the rain.\n\nDisclaimer: I received this product free or at a discounted price, in exchange for the purposes of a product review.

Nonetheless, this honest and unbiased review is a result of my own product testing and research.\n\nThis bag just announces one thing: simplicity. It does very few things very well, and I truly appreciate that in a bag. As someone who carries my things with me every day in a backpack, I know that I don't need tons of extra straps, pouches, and pockets within pockets.\n\nWith this backpack, you get three compartments: the small front pouch, the medium pocket with many slots and compartments, and then the main pouch. Yes, this backpack has a laptop sleeve, which is pretty much essential these days.\n\nAs for the quality of the construction, the bag is solid and well made. You know, it used to be that if you weren't buying a Nrthface or Ptagonia bag, you weren't getting good quality. That paradigm has simply changed. Now you can get an off-brand backpack like this one that is every bit as good as many of the name brand bags.\n\nIf you're looking for a simple backpack with some minimalist style, this bag is very nice.", "summary": "Simplicity for Your Back", "unixReviewTime": 1445904000}

It is thicker than I had thought it would be about 1/4 inches thick maybe a slight more my eyes are not really best these days. The tongue is solid brown leather and the buckle is a matted brownish - gray color metal matches well. The canvas part of belt or the back portion is a darker brown with lighter brown stitching ( see pictures below ) the stitching that runs along the seams are also a lighter beige color. I inspected all seams for loose threads or flaws and could not find any. The overall craftsmanship of this belt I would say is very good.\n\n  My husband likes it very much and it fits him well. I ordered a 38 and when I went to show my husband the size I could not find it anywhere on the belt. I would suggest they stamp size somewhere on belt. Other than that he loves it and I'm happy his pants are not sagging.\n\nI would recommend this belt it is attractive, well made and priced fairly.\n\nDisclosure.

If you need a size 7 1/2, this may not be the hat for you so I have given it 4 stars instead of 5. Over all, this hat is perfect for hiking, camping and yard work. It has several vent holes on each side and also has a snap on each side. The sides can be folded up and snapped like a bush hat but you may sunburn the top of your ears if you do so. The adjustable strap is nice and toggle allows you to push the hat back off your head and still stays strapped to you.  The brim is wide enough that it does a pretty good job at keeping the sun off of your face and neck  while still allowing you to easily stow it in a backpack etc. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.", "summary": "it should easily fit 7 1/4 but this hat just fits", "unixReviewTime": 1444780800}

Something weird is going on here, because the quality of the shirt I just received (after waiting 2.5 months for it to ship from China, by the way) is appalling!

Dayton", "reviewText": "Ok let me first start off by saying that the quality of this product is excellent and I really like the large selection of colors to choose from (red and black are my favorites). I will say that the sizes are of course subjective because as we all know each guy is different which makes choosing the correct size a bit of a challenge.\n\nI have a 31\" waste and am athletically built. According to the sizing chart I fit smack dab in-between two sizes which of course worried me because it was now a toss up between which size would be right for me. Because so many peoples reviews said go with the size up if you're from North America of the UK (I'm from the U.S.) I went with the XL size which was 31-34\". As it turned out while the waste line was fine since the material is a soft and stretches but the front pocket was simple not going to cut it and I would not describe myself as \"large\" up front :-), but simply average. I started a return with Amazon, but this particular order was not with Prime so it has to go to the seller who then decides if they will accept my return. This is were my experience hit an all time high!\n\nI can't even begin to express my gratitude for the way this product vendor treated me! As noted earlier the sizes for this product can be very hard for a guy to choose from because we're all different sizes. While I needed to return this product due to the size not being quite right I still really liked the quality overall so I had panned to return the current order and repurchase with the next size up. I was then contacted by Cece (product rep) the very next day (She's in China so there's a time difference) and she took care of everything for me promptly answering all questions. The new order was shipped and she even provided me with a tracking number. I had replacements in I think about two weeks which is very fast considering they're in China and I'm in the U.S. Here's the kicker. Cece would not accept my return and instead told me to keep the original order as a free gift! Ok they're a little small up front, but not so much that they're unusable so yes I will wear them and as such I not only didn't have to deal with the return order process, but got and extra set of briefs for no cost to me! While I can't guarantee everyone would get that same deal (nor should anyone EXPECT it), it was still a very gracious offer and the BEST EXPERIENCE I've ever had on Amazon with any vendor!\n\nOh and as far as the briefs go the material is very soft and hugs your boy parts with a bit of a pouch at the bottom. I do wish that the pouch extended upward a bit more with a seam that creates more of a pouch as I think that would make them fit more men in general if they did that. The back is perfect coverage for me and I think would be for 99% of all guys. Colors in the pics were all accurate except for maybe the brighter green color (I bought another pack of these with that color included) which was definitely more neon green than the image would indicate. The yellow is a bit on the sheer size so while I didn't get white I wold assume that the white is as well. Still I like the brightness of the yellow, but the red and black are my favorites. The packaging is also great with each pair in it's own Ziploc package with a tag that is attached by a small pin (high class if you ask me). And last but not least the sides while narrow are very soft and stretchy and do not feel like they are cutting into my sides at all including the ones I have that are a size too small.\n\nOverall great product and outstanding customer support!", "summary": "If I Could Give the Product vendor 10 Stars I Would.

Not only is it excruciatingly uncomfortable to wear, but the straps are also pretty much guaranteed to break on you within five minutes of wearing it. This thing is made of a thick but pliable plastic with some foam padding on the back part that goes against your face, and then has two adjust straps on each side which snap lock in the back to secure the mast to your face.\n\nThe main problem with this mask is that the sides are not angled back to fit around a face. The mask is flat and the sides only angle back to fit along your jaw and cheeks when they're pulled with great force by the straps. So in order to make this thing look like a mask when put on, the straps have to be tight enough to bend back the sides... and this means the mask is being pulled straight into the very front of your face HARD, with all that pressure going specifically right onto the tip of your nose. It was uncomfortable from the moment I put it on and became unbearably painful in under a minute. Then, before I even had the chance to start taking it off, one of the straps broke.\n\nThe straps are connected to the mask with one little metal rivet each, and the pressure needed to keep the sides bent was just too much for the little rivet and it broke away from the plastic. I looked to see if I could just use pliers or something to put it back on, but that didn't work. To fix it for real I'd need to use something like a small nut and bolt and run it all the way through the plastic. I did not have any so I just used hot glue figuring I could just hang the mask up or something.\n\nFor the second, identical replacement mask I received, the exact same thing happened. After the experience with the first one I had no intention of actually wearing it, but I wanted to at least get a picture of it on my face. I made the straps as long as I could to put the least amount of pressure on my face, but even that wasn't enough. Within moments of putting it on, before I could even get my camera up to take a picture, a strap on that one broke as well.\n\nSo yeah, I would not recommend that anyone buy this particular mask, especially for $30 which is a simply outrageous price for how uncomfortable and cheaply made this is.\n\nIf you found my review helpful please let me know by hitting that YES button below otherwise please leave me a comment letting me know what I can do to improve.

They are both rugged, and easy to care for.\n\nThis purse is a little bigger than I thought when I bought it, but my wife loves it.\n\nI think Saddleback could prosper even more if they gave some additional attention to what more women need in a purse.  Like, right-sizing, for what women usually need.  Examples:\n\n1. I think there needs to be a line of Saddleback purses sized in-between, that carries mainly just a big wallet and a big iPhone, a coin purse, and those other little things women carry. Saddleback's clutch purse is too small for the big iPhone and the women's big wallet, etc., while this satchel purse is too big, in my opinion.  My wife's opinion is that it is not too big; she absolutely loves it.  She can even fit her Saddleback-covered iPad in this purse with everything else, although then the purse becomes too heavy, so she won't usually be carrying her iPad around in it.\n\n2. Maybe Saddleback can take another look at the glorious latch mechanism, and come up with one more option that might be easier to open quickly with one hand.\n\nI hope Saddleback never goes away, and never falls into the cheapening process like so many other companies have (probably because most other companies are run by boards of greedy investors).", "summary": "If Everyone Knew about Their Products, Saddleback Could Become Bigger Than Microsoft", "unixReviewTime": 1451606400}

This is probably my 12th or 13th piece from Saddleback and, by far, it is my absolute favorite.\n\nThe purse is very comfortable to carry, even loaded down with my iPad, wallet, padfolio and lunch, and it is simultaneously absolutely gorgeous! I have no doubt my mind that you could fill this with bricks, carry around quite comfortably, and have it looking better with the wear! It's that good.\n\nI purchased the chestnut purse and the contrast between the two color leathers is even better than I imagined. The bag itself is a deep, dark red, with subtle creases in the leather emphasizing the life and depth of the animal. The dimension is just incredible while the nude suela leather is creamy, pure and untouched. It showcases the chestnut leather beautifully. I can't stress enough how gorgeous this purse is. I love it.\n\nOn another note, this may be just me as all of my Saddleback pieces are well broken in, but the leather did seem a little bit more dry upon arrival than I remembered. This was not a problem for me as I was already planning on conditioning it again when I received the purse.\n\nThe raw suela leather apparently soaks oils rather quickly and I desired a more uniform aging of my purse handles, which is why I treated the leather. The handles turned a very light golden amber color afterwards and ended up looking even better than when it came out of the bag! I had my doubts about darkening the handles but they were all erased immediately when I stepped away and viewed the results!\n\nThe only thing I'm not a huge fan of is the tobacco leather lining. Saddleback recently changed their pigskin to offer a softer quality product with the same level of protection. While I love the fact that they did this, this tobacco leather was definitely more aged than I anticipated. The pigskin lining is extremely soft, but is more of a mottled, dirty tobacco color. Treating it did nothing to effect the color in any way. I'm not a fan of it at all as it creates such a vast contrast from the high-end luxury of the exterior, but at least the inside my purse will never look any dirtier, that's for sure!\n\nOverall, I would buy this purse all over again. I would gift it to my mother, my sisters, my best friend, my colleagues. It's a workhorse large enough to hold everything you need in the day yet it's beauty is unsurpassed. I adore this purse and I'm looking forward to many, many years of using it. Thanks yet again Saddleback!", "summary": "A Rich, Luxurious Workhorse of a Purse", "unixReviewTime": 1442275200}

I figured I could continue paying $40-50 a pop for purses that almost met my requirements, or I could get something that would last until the end of my days.\n\nThis purse is better than I imagined. As you can see from the photos, this thing will hold a lot of stuff. That grey and orange notebook measures 7x9 inches and there's still over an inch of room to spare. It is easy for small things to get lost at the bottom, so I'd recommend using a small pouch for those little things.\n\nThis purse is solid. There is no way that this purse will start sagging and flopping over in any direction. The top grain leather outside, with the pigskin inside, along with some reinforcing along the front flap will ensure that this beauty stands tall, no matter what.\n\nAnd it is beautiful. I chose black, which is stunning with the suela. It's classic and rugged at the same time. Saddleback advertises that the suela darkens over time, and it'll turn to a delicious honey color. I chose to help this along a little when I conditioned the purse.\n\nMany people are concerned about the latch mechanism. I don't know if it's a change for all of their new purses, but mine does not swivel like the other pictures. The latch is still stiff, but I have no issues opening the purse one-handed.

Edwards", "reviewText": "I got a Saddleback satchel 4 years ago to use as a purse. While I loved how sturdy and well-made it was, I always wished it looked a bit more like a ladies' purse. It had a very men's messenger bag look and my husband immediately wanted it for himself. (I'm giving that old bag to him now, all worn in - lucky him!)\n\nBut when I started looking for a new bag, I immediately went to Saddleback again. I'm kind of like a convert to their leather, because it's just SUCH high quality. I was thrilled to see this new design. After months and months of saving up and waiting, I finally got it. Some thoughts:\n\nBEST THINGS:\n\n* Seriously rugged. In other words, it's a Saddleback. If you don't know what that means, then you're in for a treat - go check out the videos on the website and you'll see. This stuff is made with the highest quality full grain leather and it's tough as nails and gorgeous to boot. My previous Saddleback bag only got prettier the more I roughed it up and dragged it around. (Compare that with a high-end designer bag I was given that began to fall apart within a month - and they were both in the $300 range!) It seems the more you use these things, the prettier they get.\n\n* Great design. I loved the original satchel, too. This one is great also though, perhaps with a slight (very slight) advantage of looks to function ratio. That's okay, I wanted the looks. The main compartment is pretty big (my mom looked in it and said, 'whoa! that's like a toolbox in there') - but it's surprisingly lighter than I thought (it's lighter than the messenger satchel I have from Saddleback, which surprised me). The key fob and inner and outer pockets are useful. There's a minimum of interior organization, which means I have to keep it neat, but I can fit more stuff in (including my DSLR camera in it's case, amazingly enough). Also, it opens so wide and has a light-colored interior so it's easy to see into. The cross-body strap and handles make for easy carrying whatever your preference.\n\n* Feels good to carry. This is kind of a big one for me. The saddleback satchel was kind of on the heavy side. Maybe I'm used to that beast, but this feels lighter by comparison. It's still pretty heavy-duty and so correspondingly heavyish, but it's not bad. Also the strap is a bit slimmer, but still strong (has that polyester lining in it) so it's much more comfortable cross-body. Also, the attachments for the cross-body strap are a much nicer hardware set up than my old satchel (that one screwed shut and sometimes came undone. these have a hinge and snap shut - much more secure and easier). The suela handles are really comfy, too.\n\n* Looks amazing. I got the black. I love a good, classic black purse, but a lot of the saddleback bags were such that I didn't like the design when it was in the black color. The suela + black just pops. It's SO pretty and classic. After I got this, I walked through a department store display of designer bags and realized my saddleback was way prettier to me and more classic than all of those.  I just love it. I've only had it a week and already got several compliments of people wanting to know what it was and where I got it. It's very striking, but very classy. It strikes a really awesome balance between rugged and lady-like, classic and unexpected. I love that.\n\nGOOD STUFF:\n\n(Not pros and cons, just what I love vs. what I like):\n\n* The clasp. - Okay, I read a LOT on that clasp before buying this and was really leery of it. Here's the thing: it's not the simplest thing to open. However, I really like it all the same. What else would you use, I kind of want to know? I mean, the clasp really looks nice. It adds so much to the look of the bag. And it keeps the thing shut and keeps anyone from getting into the bag. The thing that I couldn't see in pictures is that the clasp is on a sort of pin that allows it to rotate 360. Now, saddleback hardware is nigh indestructible (stainless steel horse tackle is basically what they use), so I know it will last. The thing is that because the clasp rotates a bit, it's rarely laying quite the way you left it. Sometimes I can reach over and flip the thing open one-handed - and even close it one handed. Other times, it's twisted around to another angle and I need to concentrate and use both hands to get it open or shut.\n\nTo me, that's a pretty minor thing for an overall amazing bag. If you're used to magnetic snaps, it may annoy you at first. But it will last much, much longer. And it looks so pretty. This is my for-looks bag. And also, the other satchels have a strap-and-belt-buckle getup which is also a bit of work to open and close. That's just the price I figure I have to pay for people not getting into my bag easily - I have to take a moment to get into my bag, too.\n\n* Base & feet. I do wonder why the base-plate of suela is not glued or sewn down. I keep wondering if junk will collect in there. I mean, that's a pretty minor thing for an overall amazing bag, but I do wonder about that. For a future design, I wonder if they'll revisit it.\n\n* Black thread on the suela. I didn't realize this until I got the bag, but the thread is the same color throughout. So that means the thread holding the suela down on the bag is black like the rest of the body (and that's continuous poly thread - that stuff does NOT fray, I can tell you that from my previous satchel which I dragged all over the place.) It makes an...interesting look. It's not bad, exactly. It just ... I dunno. It's not peach on black - it's black lines around the peach on black. It's a subtly more western nod than I was expecting. Again, not bad, but look closely at the photos and you can see it. If that's going to totally annoy you, maybe go for the tobacco bag which has a closer-to-suela colored thread? Again, a really, really small thing, but something I did notice.\n\nSummary: Overall, this bag is a workhorse - a lovely, aristocratic workhorse - and I'm super excited to have this become my forever signature bag.\n\nI imagine I may get other products from Saddleback eventually (belt? wallet?) but one thing I won't need to do is get another bag.

If you're squeamish about handling cremated remains, have a friend or family member fill this for you, as you will  have to touch ashes.\nAnother tip is to use crazy glue on the threads of the stopper when you screw it shut.

I guess it's just how the fabric is dyed because I am not even close to overstretching these pants.  Also, while on the fabric looks like there is a splotchy grey stain... I only noticed it because I was looking for defects like that and I can only see it when the pants are on me. I thought maybe I got a bad one so I reordered (still have the first pair here) and the \"stains\" on the second pair are worse!  They are not very dark but look like I have a bad bruise that is visible under the light peach fabric. Maybe it will wash out? And despite being very dark grey they are still slightly see through. I'm not sure anyone else would notice my panty outlines but again that was what I was looking for so it was noticeable to me.\n\nThese kinda make me feel like a sea-world employee, not really a positive or negative, just kind get that vibe while wearing them.\nOverall good pants for the price with a nice design and fun colors.", "summary": "Pretty good for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1463961600}

It's just another Chinese manufacturer using their label. Clue one was the faux wrap neckline which is really awkwardly stitched together just above the cleavage. This makes the neckline sit above the hairline in the back which means a bad hairday is almost guaranteed. Clue two is the crappy pleather buckle straps and the buckle itself which won't stay flush so your left arm constantly snags on it making the situation worse and I'd imagine eventually also causing a hole in the arm. My third issue is with the length because it comes down below my knees which is really awkward for a sweater dress. This may or may not be a sizing issue. After reading reviews, I sized up but I really wish I hadn't because it is WAY too big so it's possible they made the larger size much longer as well. Some manufacturers have a tendency to do that since they think anyone in need of larger sizes must be an amazon.

I selected this one mainly because of the size.  I love hobo bags but hate carrying giant purses.  My current purse was too small for my wallet, cell phone, sunglasses, and my son's epipen.  This one is PERFECT!  The size is big enough for everything I need to carry daily and has extra room for my coupon wallet on grocery day and my iPad when we go on vacation.  And yet it's not so big that I feel like I'm dragging around a beach bag or a piece of luggage.  There are a couple drawbacks that buyers should be aware of.  I bought this bag in the mustard yellow.  It is definitely mustard yellow, not quite as vibrant as the picture.  And there are a couple of very small spots on the suede.  I've opted to keep the bag instead of exchanging it for one that is pristine because it's yellow so it's going to get stains on it and now I won't feel bad about getting the first stain on it.  The other complaint I would have to point out is that the lining is really cheap.  I mean REALLY.  It's a stiff vinyl that sounds like paper crinkling when it moves.  Again, not a deal breaker for me.  But if you expect a nicely lined bag with cute fabric, this is not going to make you happy.  (I'm adding to the original review after carrying the bag for a few weeks)  I still like the size but the lining already has a tear in it.  And the black dye from the lining is discoloring my wallet.  At this point, I would not recommend this product.", "summary": "I Love It But...", "unixReviewTime": 1499990400}

However, the Eyekeeper is Not-foldable sunglasses and since it wasn't foldable, it was bit difficult to store it in my bag.\n\nAnyway, initially, i bought Maui Jim Sandhill Polarized at $275.00 because I just loved the look, titanium, foldable and square lenses.  however, I had to return because it was bit too small for my face.\n\nWhen I saw this Fonex titanium sunglasses, it had everything that I wanted.

Of course, it is not Maui Jim, but it is not $275.00 either.  Titanium frame seems to be strong enough to last few years, lenses are bit thin, but it is well polarized.  Specially, I think that the frame is well screwed into the lenses that I do not think that it will get loose or be broken soon.  Probably it will soon or later and probably it is not as strong as the titanium Maui Jim Sandhill, but for the price, it is really excellent product.\n\nAs far as the quality of polarized lenses are concerned, again, it is not as clear as my other name brand sunglasses, such as Maui Jim, Persol & Ray Ban, but let's say that Maui Jim lenses quality is 9.5 out of 10, and Persol & Ray Ban are about 8.9.

Another things i like about this coat is the opening front because i want to also be able to show what ever i'm wearing under it give it a more flirty looking. Thought i was kinda disappointed with the zipper because it isn't as gold as it\n appears in the picture.\n\nWhen it comes to sizing this depends on your body type so i dnt really follow everyone's advice on the other reviews. I had to order this jacket about 3 times in order to find my size. First time i ordered XXL because one of the reviews said they are usually a med and ordered the biggest size and still didn't fit so i was scared and ordered and the XXL and it was too big it was huge. The next time i ordered and L because i know that by bust size is a 36DD and i don't like things tight on my arm and i like to have a little room for at least a tee shirt or long sleeve shirt all that being said i like my coats fitted. the L was tight on my arm and my back i couldn't lift my arm up. I went back and ordered an XL and i have not received that yet but hopefully that is my size. I will write another review on my XL. I hope this helps. But i would recommend getting 2 size bigger ex: if you wear a M order XL if your bust size is 36D or DD and yes it is long you might want to hem it i am 5'6 or 5'7 even if you wear heels i dnt think you want your coat picking or sweeping the floor. lol Excuse my spellings i rushing as i write this...\n\nMy X-large arrived about 2 weeks ago and i love it. i have room its not snug  so i have room to wear traditional clothes and anything under it. but im going to need to hem it because its still too long even with heels and i want to wear this alot in the spring or fall i think it can be worn even in the winter but with something heavy under it so get two size bigger and give urself room. either way its a nice jacket.", "summary": "First of all i love the jacket because it is different", "unixReviewTime": 1455148800}

The front zipper stops at the waist and the bottom of the coat doesn't zip and actually has about a 2-3\" gap, which I like.\nThe inside is lined, the coat has pockets on the outside which is always a big plus. I think a smaller fit in the torso would be (if I ordered a size small) but then I think the arm length would have been too short, so medium for that reason the medium works.

Unless you're teeny tiny, shoulders will almost certainly be a little tight, and unless you have no chest (I ordered largest size available, have 38D bust) at all the odds are good that you won't be able to zip it up because I can't get anywhere close to doing so despite not being overweight at all.  This wasn't a concern for me though, as I want the coat open at all times anyway, and the shoulders aren't tight enough that it is a mobility issue, but other buyers might not like this.\n\n2. The coat is very, very long, and the length of the coat goes up significantly with the largest sizes, which results in the coat trailing along the ground (I'm 5'7'').  Unless you are very tall you are probably going to want to get it hemmed; I plan on doing that myself.\n\nSo this coat is either for people who are very tall and thin or people who don't mind slightly snug tops they can't zip up and who are willing to get the coat hemmed.\n\nBeyond all this, I think the coat is very unusual and absolutely lovely, and being able to have just the top gives the piece versatility that my wardrobe is in desperate need of. I picked grey because the black read a little too... catholic priest to me, and grey goes with pretty much anything.  It gives me a military vibe that tickles my fancy.  I adore it and I can't wait to get it hemmed so I can wear the full piece.  For me, it is a 5 star product, but it definitely isn't for everyone.\n\nAlso, the tag it came with has some of the most adorable Engrish I've ever seen and I'm going to turn it into a fridge magnet.  <3", "summary": "Bit of an odd fit but I don't care.

It doesn't slip!!!  You have to get used to adjusting it but how hard is it to feed slack through from one side of the buckle and pull it through the other?  Piece of cake.

I find that important so that it doesn't allow the belt loop in the back of the shorts/pants/whatever from curling the belt or, alternatively, the waste of the belt from curling over.  The quality is impressive and you will really love the black cover and quality rivets on the end.  These belts travel well and I actually bought five of them in different colors.  Measure yourself carefully.  I have a 36 waste and use the medium.  It gives about four inches of extra, enough to fit under the first loop for most pants.  The large will be just too large, adding another 4-5 inches if memory serves.  Frankly, some seem to like that but I think it is goofy having nine inches of slack wrapped around your body almost to your backside through three loops.  Ideally, I would have liked another inch or two of slack but the medium works just fine and looks good.  The buckle and the anodized surface are fabulous...and by the way, the little dinosaur skeleton thing is actually etched into the metal...like one of those vibrating pen types of things.  You can feel it.  I've received numerous compliments.  Wish I could find in tan.  That would complete my collection.

A prior buyer wrote a fantastic review far more detailed than I, and included great pictures as one of my biggest concerns with purchasing an alexandrite ring online was that I wasn't going to get to see if it did possess colour changing properties. While lab created, this stone really does change colours in daylight and by candlelight, in soft light and under pot lights. It is a beautiful deep eggplant purple in regular light, changes to a raspberry in different light and has blue/green undertones in different light. The setting is unique with the emerald cut alexandrite turned on its side to be a diamond shape, and the double prongs at each corner are stunning but still lend to simplicity which lets the colour and size of this stone shine through. At 2.75 carats it's not overwhelming in size but is small enough to look \"genuine\" and not just a cocktail ring. The white gold ring itself is fairly dainty, it looks bigger in the Peora pictures but I was pleased with this feature. Came beautifully packaged in a blue box with a small spotlight when u open the box. A beautiful piece with a unique setting, an affordable alexandrite that does change colours set in white gold.

The gem is nicely faceted, well polished and exhibits 100% color change. A natural Alexandrite of this size, clarity and color change would be $20,000+\n\nThe ring arrived in a bubble pack envelope via USPS and had to be sign for. Inside the envelope was a heavier that expected blue box tied with blue ribbon. Inside that box was a blue ring box, that when opened, shines an LED light on the ring, which sits upright in spongy white fabric. As this ring is a gift, the packaging makes for a very nice presentation. (The only improvement in this area I can think of, is a sound chip producing Ooohs & Aaahs and then a burst of applause)\n\nThe ring shank appears thinner in real life than in the product photo but I don't believe there is any deception going on. The manufacture of the shank and mount is clean and smooth. The prongs and surrounding cage appear more than adequate to hold the gemstone securely. The Rhodium coating looks well executed, however time will tell its actual quality.\n\nA downside of the ring is that it only comes in size 7. It can be resized by a local jeweler, but that will be a non-trivial additional expense. You should get some estimates about resizing a white gold ring if needed.\n\nBuying synthetic Alexandrite without seeing it in person is a bit of a gamble. Many vendors misuse terms like \"Lab\" or \"Created\" as well as \"Synthetic\" when they should be using the term Simulated Alexandrite. If the Alexandrite is not color changing Chrysoberyl then it should be labeled \"Simulated\". A common Simulated Alexandrite is heat treated synthetic Corundum laced with Vanadium. It is very pretty in its own right but it does not possess the green color of Alexandrite in daylight. Happily this ring has the real synthetic.\n\nAlexandrite is a little darker than many gemstones but it has nice sparkle and is very durable (8.5 Mohs). These are the colors you can expect to see.\nSunlight:: Green/Teal separated by dark lanes with a sprinkling of pinkish/red flashes.\nOpen shade: Bright teal with intermittent dark lanes.\nFlorescent light:: Teal highlights with Amethyst like dark purple lanes.\nIncandescent light:: Diffuse pinkish/purple with lighter highlights.\nLong wave UV light:: Glows red.\n\nConclusion: Good value synthetic (Lab Created) Alexandrite ring, almost sure to amaze and delight the recipient.\n\nI am going to try to attach some pictures to show what you get and under various lighting to show the ring's color change effect. These were taken with a phone camera and I don't have proper setup for jewelry photography, so if anything looks ugly it is not the ring's fault.\n\n1) Boxes\n2) Open ring box\n3) Open shade daylight\n4) Incandescent\n5,6) Mixed lighting", "summary": "The gem is nicely faceted, well polished and exhibits 100% color change", "unixReviewTime": 1454544000}

I got this for my husband and he really likes it.  I ordered the small (the tag will read XL though), in the light denim wash.  For reference my husband is 5'3\" tall, has a chest measurement of 35\", and a waist measurement of 33\".  This jacket fit him pretty well in the small.  It is a little big but he likes to wear things a little oversized.  I am including a photo of him wearing the jacket so you can see the fit of it.  I took a couple of measurements of the jacket.  From the top of the sleeve to the cuff is 21\" in length with the cuff adding another 2.25\" to the length.  The breadth of the jacket measures 21\".  The only complaint he has about this jacket is there are no pockets for his hands.  I tend to agree with him on that one.  I like pockets on a jacket as well.  Overall he likes this jacket and based on his opinion I recommend this jacket if you are looking for a good jean jacket and don't mind not having pockets for your hands.\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis product was provided to me either free or at a discounted rate for reviewing purposes.

It really is an awesome piece to wear this fall season! I am 5'7, 160 lbs, with a muscular frame (~ 8-10% body fat), and I went with a Medium in the \"blue\" color. I normally wear a small in outerwear for a more tailored look, but this jacket fit me PERFECTLY. An important thing to take note of, is this jacket is tailored to an asian frame. Asian men on average have smaller frames, so I would HIGHLY recommend ordering one size up from the size your normally order, unless of course you have a very thin frame.\nI took some measurements to hopefully clear up any confusion, please refer to my pictures for this. Keep in mind when viewing these pictures that I ordered a Medium, which equates to an XXL in asian sizing.\n\nSome individual's have stated that the buttons on this jacket make a lot of noise. While this is true, this only happens if the jacket is unbuttoned. Once the jacket is buttoned up, they do not move or make noise. The hood on this jacket comes off, however, I think it looks better on. The jacket has kept me very warm on these crisp fall days, and I definitely think it will do the same for you! Just make sure you read the sizing information carefully!\n\nI received this product to test in exchange for an honest review.

They are also a bit tight to push through the button hole but I'm not worried about that - keeps the jacket securely shut if you plan on it staying put. The hood is detachable which is interesting - looks way better with the hood on. The Jean is good quality and so is the jersey hood and sleeves.\n\nI'd give 5 stars if the front buttons were better quality and if it had pockets.

All them, until this order, fit great as a large and are of high quality. I've been very pleased with every other order. However, on this order the company sent me what appeared to be a used tee shirt that arrived with the tag cut off and a stain on the lower front part of the tee. Also, the tee is marked Large, but it is clearly at least a 1X - it's massive and unwearable.\n\n*I originally marked this order with one star, but am upgrading the review to three stars to reflect the customer service I received after filing an issue with this order. While the shirt was not what I had ordered, I have loved all of the other shirts I have received through Joe's USA and their customer service person offered a prompt refund and additional clarification about their communication with me. I will remain a loyal customer of this company and understand that, from time to time, an order does not work out as intended. I would highly recommend ordering from this company - prompt service, excellent customer service, and generally speaking, great tee shirts (I have reviewed other shirts received with 5 stars).", "summary": "Received Damaged and Missized Shirt", "unixReviewTime": 1469491200}

Same quality. Looks elegant. Well made and excellent for displaying various styles of necklaces.\n\nMy ONLY complaint is the base was a little dirty. Not a big issue because is a base...no one is going to ignore the jewelry and turn it over to make sure the base is clean. That is just me being picky.\n\nNo elegant packaging either like a box, again I'm being picky because a display like this (but not as nice) from a craft store will also not come in a box.\n\nI love it.

Based on popular reviews, I decided to order these, and was rather disappointed with what I received.\n\nPros:\n\nCute, fun designs\nWide waistband (preferred for me, maybe be different for others)\nSoft\n\nCons:\n\nThin\nRipped on inside (see photos)\nSmall (despite stretching out)\nEasily snagged\nDoes not stay in place\nRides up\nLine around the legs\n\nFirst the pros. The design was really really cool. Im not one that typically cares about designs on underwear (who really sees it, anyway), but the moment I took it out of the package, I fell in love with the design. The wider waistband was a plus, for me anyways, as it is a reassuring factor.  The texture was really nice and sift, as well, being mostly nylon, I was expecting this, anyways.\n\nThe cons. Let it be known that, for the price, I was not expecting high quality clothing, but based on the reviews, I had higher hopes, thinking maybe the reviews were just a few lemons. Right after noticing the cute design and waistband, I noticed the thin material. It is very very thin, and that raised a red flag for me immediately. When I went to try them on, is when I noticed the snags you see in the photos. Thinking maybe I did this when I started to put them on, I examined the other ones. All have the similar snag and pulls in it as the first.  All of which, mind you, looks like runs in nylons themselves, for those that recognize that. Furthermore, my fingers were catching in the fabric as I was attempting to put them on, just like a pair of nylons would. Important to note, I have bras that are made with 92% nylon (2% more in these underwear), and this is not an issue with those.\n\nThe size was an issue, as well. Granted, it does state one size fits most, but with 34 hips, I was surprised and how snug they were. And, of course, with that, came the fact that they were riding up, and giving free wedgies. For those that may wear pantyliners (whether frequently or infrequently), the riding up of these underwear forced these liners, into, otherwise unpleasant places and at odd angles. Important to note, which is not listed under the description, is that the lining of these underwear were not cotton.\n\nAnother issue was the label that said seamless. There is definitely a seam, which is around the legs of these, that is quite thick, and not something that could be missed under form fitting clothing.\n\nOverall, despite the soft material, colorful design and wider waistband, the snagged material, snug fit, causing riding into places unknown, will have me returning these, and looking elsewhere.", "summary": "Cute, not comfortable", "unixReviewTime": 1468886400}

This bag is made of some sturdy material, so I'm sure it can withstand the elements of your everyday use.

The flare is pretty wide, but the saddles fit perfectly if you can get them in alright. If your ears are still healing from a recent stretch or are just not very elastic, you could have trouble getting them in. One nice feature of these is how wide they are. A lot of stone plugs have thin saddles and sit almost flush with your ear or fall out easily because of it. These are nice and wide (long? whatever), so your lobes will have plenty of room, no matter how fat they are.

Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase. I purchased this particular style in different colors. The colors are vibrant, the cardigans are soft and just the right thickness to be worn throughout every season. The fit is pretty true to size (I am 5'1 , 150 lbs and a 38K and the XL works great!) I am able to button them if I choose but I prefer to wear them open since layers look better on my frame. The only downside is I was sent 5 1XL's instead of all 10 XL's so I had to do a little altering but they fit just fine now. The labels are different as well. Some were BIAGIO  and the others were Cielo but they all were good quality. I will be ordering them in more colors in the future. I was so excited about them that I showed a friend of mine who had ordered cardigans from a website that sold \"one-size fits all\" for only $7.

However, I can fix the smell with some dryer sheets, and inside the purse I have a very big wallet, a small make up bag, a hair brush, a tube of lotion, an MP3 player, Mints, keys, a check book, pens, a passport, and some other random things.

The fit is perfect! The quality of the lace is very nice & soft.  The lining of this top is sown in at the sides & tacked at the top edge so that the lining sits straight & flat.  The lining is stretchy, thin but not see through, & comfortable.  Also, at the bottom hem, the lining is about 4\" shorter than the lace.  The top edge of the lace must be cut from a larger sheet, & there are a few threads that should have been trimmed away better but weren't.  No problem, I will rectify that with a quick snip of my scissors.  The stitching on this top is straight & fine.\n\nAll in all, this top was a great purchase!  I've seen similar tops sold that ship from the US, but were more than twice the price.  I'm happy that I decided to be patient & spend less money.

Maybe most importantly, the back compartment, with slots for your credit cards, passport, and cash, is RFID protected so that they can't be scanned by thieves who can steal your personal information. Electronic pickpockets are on the rise, and this bag will protect you from it!\n\nThe bag has two front pockets with magnetic closures, a roomy back zippered pocket with credit card, cash and passport pockets and a zippered pocket for change or other small items.  There are two side pockets, useful for keys, sunglasses, or even a water bottle.  The main zippered compartment is extra roomy and has two slip pockets and a large zippered pocket.\n\nFinally, this bag is beautiful and well made! I'm a Coach addict, so I'm used to having only top quality bags. This bag, though not leather, is very high quality and attractive. I feel great when I carry it, so I've been using it even when I'm not traveling, and I've already ordered another bag from Travelon.\n\nIf I could give this bag six stars, I would!\nIf you're a traveler, do yourself a favor and look into Travelon products.", "summary": "THE best travel bags are from Travelon!", "unixReviewTime": 1443225600}

Fortunately, I cannot review its \"anti-theft\" properties fully. However, I can say that this bag held everything I needed to carry with me on day trips from the place we were staying, and also it was great for air travel.\n\nThe bag has a back pocket which is lined with an RFID-protective material, which also has a clasp to keep the zipper closed. That pocket has smaller pockets for credit cards as well. I was able to fit four passports, as well as our printed travel plans (8.5\" x 11\") folded in half in that pocket. In the main compartment of the bag, I had enough room for two smaller journals, my phone, external phone battery and USB charging cable, business cards, an e-reader, pens, pencils, mints, and my Sony a-6000 interchangeable lens camera with the smaller lens attached. In the small pocket, I had an array of emergency medicine, earbuds, and lip moisturizer. With all of these things in the main pocket, I was still able to zip the purse closed when necessary and the additional clasp held the zipper in place. The two front pockets close by magnet, but are the perfect size to hold a Travelon RFID-blocking wallet. Because of the shape (the pocket is tapered at the top), it would be difficult to pick the wallet from the pocket, unless you're the one wearing the bag. I used the two side pockets to hold a few water bottles a lot of the time, as our destinations were quite warm.\n\nI like the wider bottom on this bag, and it is a quality I usually seek out in my purses/bags as I hate having the contents of my purse empty out on the floor when I am at a restaurant, a theater, or in my car.\n\nMost of the time when we were traveling, I wore the bag across my body, and the strap adjusted well enough that it fit comfortably. Two things I don't like about this bag:  the nylon (?) fabric is fairly slippery, and so wearing it on just one shoulder doesn't feel secure at all. It wants to slip right off. Also, I thought it would be big enough to carry my oversized tablet in the main compartment with my other stuff, so I could use it as a purse and carry-on bag for the airplane, but it needs to be about 1\" taller for that.\n\nDespite those two little issues, I am very happy with this bag.", "summary": "Good cross-body anti-tip bag with secure pockets for travel", "unixReviewTime": 1476316800}

I ordered a large in this size as I typically wear a medium or large at a store such as Forever21. When I pulled these out of the packaging, holy cow.....they definitely run small. I didn't think at first that they would fit, I was kind of scared to even try to put them on. Much to my shock, I was able to get them on and not only that but they were rather comfortable! However, since the product is super stretchy, that means it sheers out when it expands. You definitely couldn't see anything but I know I would want more of a barrier between me and that creepy guy who stares at me at the gym. However, for yoga at home or to sleep, they were great. The other not so great thing was that they were sort of short. For me, this is no problem. I am 5' 2'' and these landed just at my ankle bone. I am used to pants bunching up a bit, so a short length worked well for me. However, I would say if you are anything about 5' 3'', these might start turning into capris for you. I know the title of the clothing says capri, but it shows a full length pant.\n\nOther than that, it was a very comfortable product. It was super comfy on, the material is soft (if not a little thin), and I am happy with my purchase. Just keep in mind that they DO run quite small.

We ordered a size small and the top fit well and the style of the top would have allowed for up to a large C cup to fit as well.\n\nThe bottom of the swimsuit ran about 1/2 a size too small in the hip and in the butt. My daughter has very average sized hips and butt and it is uncommon for bottoms to be too small on her. The cut of the bottom made the waist too tight and was narrow in the back so that an awkward amount of \"side butt\" was showing. The bottom of this bikini will not work well on women with semi-full or full, hips or butts but will work well on a range of bust sizes.\n\nPros: Website ccurately depicted colors and prints\n  Top fits as expected\n  Top can fit a range of bust sizes\n  Good quality fabric\n\nCons: Bottom ran a 1/2 size too small\n  Bottom not for women who are even slightly full in the hip and butt\n\nOverall we thought this was a very cute swimsuit and had we been able to order the top and bottom separately to get a size larger in the bottoms then we probably would not have needed to return the swimsuit.", "summary": "Very cute but bottoms are sized too small", "unixReviewTime": 1463011200}

This was also verified to me by the seller upon ordering although, the seller told me to order 1-2 sizes larger.  I went ahead and ordered 3 sizes larger which put me into the Plus Size, XXXL (3X).  Indeed these tops fit way small!  I typically wear a size large (due to my bust size) but the 3X fit me like I'd expect a large to. It still has a very feminine fit around the middle so this top is not designed to wear as a baggy, loose garment.\n\nI received the tunic enclosed in a plastic bag to keep dirt or debris off during shipping and handling.  The material feels great, it's super thin but drapes well.  I wear tank tops under everything so this would be very comfortable to wear even in the summer.  The seams are simple with a long seam running the entire length of the back, from neck to tail.\n\nOverall, if you get the fit right with the proper size, add a scarf or a long necklace and wear something to conceal your undergarments this is not a bad top.

I've been eyeballing this one for quite some time now, but hesitated, as I know sometimes those \"honest reviews\" aren't so honest. I was also worried it would be itchy--I have sensitive skin so even slightly rough textures irritate me--but it's not. It has virtually no prickly feeling whatsoever... and I like to have my scarves nicely tucked up against my neck! The colors are as vibrant in the photos too. It's not a thin material, so it's rather poofy when you wrap it up around your neck. I've been looking for a perfect blanket scarf and this is it. My only gripe about it is that the threads pull really easily, so you have to be extra careful with it. However, I've washed it several times now (with like materials) and it's still looking like new. Doesn't shed or anything either, which is nice. So glad I bought this scarf.", "summary": "Awesome blanket scarf!", "unixReviewTime": 1454198400}

I finally wore these for a run the other day and was pleasantly surprised.  Prior to this I had just lounged around the house with them.  The fit is good and they are just the right thickness for running in cool weather.  I wouldn't recommend these for cold weather but they did fine in below 50 degree temps.  My only real difficulty with these is how loose they are at the ankles.  From mid calf on up they have great compression (not enough for medical purposes but great for staying in place and keeping the material from shifting) but below that they are so loose that they just hang there...almost to the point of being uncomfortable. I did have to add a drawstring since the waist is very loose as well but that is typical for pants of this style....not sure why all manufacturers don't automatically add a drawstring.  I've only worn these to run or while lounging around the house so I can't speak to their fit during other types of exercise.  The color scheme is nice but the panels don't really add any value to them for exercise purposes.  In general the loose ankles and the need to add the drawstring keep these from being 5 star pants.  However, for the price point (get them when they drop to about 20 bucks) you can't really go wrong.", "summary": "Good for running", "unixReviewTime": 1457308800}

Thats a feature you don't often see these days.\n\nThe cut is on the relaxed side. I have it in large and, while I would not call it baggy, its certainly not a trim or fitted cut. That works fine for this shirt since polo shirts are casual wear by design.  I have it in gray, and the color is a nice, medium gray that looks very similar to the color depicted in the product listing.\n\nThe one area where the cut could be improved is the sleeves. They are cut really wide which in and of itself is not bad, but they also have a cuffed hem on them. The wide cut would look better without a cuffed hem (or, conversely, a tighter cut with the cuffed hem).\n\nOther than that issue, zero complaints.

I used to get compliments on my old ones every time I wore them.  These are no where as nice and twice the price!", "summary": "Purely for Looks, not functional!", "unixReviewTime": 1485475200}

Being rather large on top it's almost impossible to ever find a swimsuit that both provides adequate coverage and support.  This does both!  The swimsuit top sizes match perfectly to the bra sizes of this company.

I would not wear without something to cover the butt and underwear. I like that they are so thin and lightweight because I plan to wear them in the summer. I wouldn't want anything too heavy. The fabric is very stretchy but it's not nylon like tights or leotards. It has a thin cottony feel to it. It says it is modal. I am very pleased.

The strap on the first one is ripping due to high use over the last 4-5 years!

I get more complements and curiosity about it.  And I love being able to express myself with color - plus I can actually see it inside my purse.  It holds my drivers license, debit card, 3 most-frequently used credit cards, auto club, Costco, medical insurance, and Good Sam cards - these are the ones I need to hand the most.  I don't carry money in the zipper pocket, but I do carry all of my punch cards for coffee stands and stores that I frequent so that they are handy.

After wearing them for awhile I am finding them to be a lot more comfortable than my boxers.

Another note is that I believe the \"C\" curve of the necklace would be more attractive as a solid shiny piece as opposed to having the blue square print on the exterior side.\n\nNotes about the necklace. The charm is a little over an inch in length. It is heavy for a necklace (weighing in a .75 of an ounce) but not heavy enough to be burdensome. The TARDIS does spin, which made me very happy. Some reviewer commented that it gets stuck, mine does get hung up occasionally (not with every rotation) but it can be pushed through and continuously spun.\n\nOverall I'm happy with the necklace. It is a good piece, but not fine jewelry. I recommend it to serious Whovians.\n\nI received this necklace at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

I have 4 MayriDresses (this one, Peacock, Tree Branches, and Blue floral) and this one is my favorite. Fit is very comfortable, though if you have a large bust the bodice isn't the most flattering style (the undefined squareness of it kind of makes your chest look like you've got bread box stuffed underneath), but it is stretchy so can easily accommodate a bigger bustline. The length may be a problem for some. I'm 5'9\" and in bare feet it touches the floor to pool with about an inch still to go - in 1\" heels it skims the floor - which I actually really like, a 2\" heel would probably be the safest to eliminate a possible tripping hazard but I can't really do more than a 1\" heel. I'd definitely have a tripping issue in flats though, so take that into consideration. I thought about cutting and hemming it, but chiffon frays like crazy if it's cut and I'm fine wearing it with the 1\" heel. Excellent workmanship, it really is a very pretty dress and manages to be both casual and dressy. It's chiffon so it's sheer but there is a white under lining (no matter what color the outer dress is) that ends approx mid-calf and I haven't found it to be immodest at all.

She is going to school to become a dental hygienist and it has been intense. Even though she isn't working right now and school is the only thing that she is focusing on currently, it has been tough. Every time I talk to her she seems to be consuming some kind of caffeine to help fuel her late night, early morning study sessions. She has taken a lot of chemistry and biology classes and I know that she will appreciate the slightly nerdy nature of this necklace.\n\nThis necklace arrived promptly and in a small felt jewelry pouch. I was a bit bemused to find that it was inside, not one, not two, but three little plastic bags. I still haven't figured out why it needed so many. The necklace looked to be a bit more yellowy than it did in the product description photos. Not by much, but enough that I noticed. This might bother me more than it would other people because I am not personally a fan of yellow gold, it looks atrocious on me, but keep that in mind if the color of the gold is something that is really important to you or whomever you are purchasing this necklace for.\n\nThe molecule is really solid feeling and I think that it would have to be abused fairly spectacularly to bend or break. The chain that the molecule is on is very nice and dainty. I would like to add that I don't think it would be toddler or baby safe though. I think about jewelry this way ever since I had my daughter. She is now 2.5 and has learned to be careful when looking at mommys necklace or earrings, but it definitely wasn't that way early on, and even now she can accidentally be rougher than she means to be. This necklace, or rather I should say the chain of this necklace, would not survive a solid toddler tug, so keep that in mind if you are buying this for someone with small children.  The part of the chain that would be directly at the back of the wearers neck is slightly different from the rest of the chain. It has about 2 inches of larger, but not thicker, gold chain than the rest of the necklace. I don't think that this should be an issue because the fixed nature of the pendant should ensure that the back of the necklace won't inch around to the front like chains that have loose pendants tend to.\n\nMy one big complaint is that I wish it had better packaging. The felt bag is okayish as far as presentation goes, but I wish it came in a box or had something like a little card that explained what the necklace is. I suppose this wouldnt be an issue if you were giving this to a chemistry major, but most of us have slept since chemistry class. I certainly don't recall the precise molecular structure for caffeine, or anything else for that matter. Maybe this just bothers me because I was an Advertising Design major and I feel that good packaging is at least half the battle in designing a good product, but I really think that a nice instructional card and gift box could take this to a higher level.\n\nOverall, I think that this is a lovely necklace and I definitely recommend it. I am considering by either the rose gold or the rhodium plated silver serotonin molecule for myself some time. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.\n\nPhoto Note: I will have my friend send me a picture of her wearing the necklace once I give it to her in about a month, and please excuse the cat hair on my necklace display. No matter how hard I try to keep it hair free I have three cats and the fabric the display has on it is like a freaking magnet for any kind of hair, and it doesnt like to come off.  And grr! My photos keep uploading sideways. I don't know how this happens and I can't seem to fix it! If anyone can tell me how I can fix it or keep it from happening in the first place, please tell me in the comments. It drives me up the wall.", "summary": "Necklace is awesome, but I wish the presentation was better!", "unixReviewTime": 1457136000}

Their clothes are fun and quirky and wonderfully comfortable! It is within the last three months that I have discovered the absolute joy of wearing this oversized clothing! I love it, love it, love it! Not only is the clothing very unique, but it is well crafted. I have yet to find any flaws in the garments - not even a loose string - and I have purchased at least a dozen of their garments.\n\nI've done a lot of shopping of their clothing for summer-weight garb, but it was time to start thinking about fall rolling in, so I purchased this neat quilted top.  I purchased this in blue, and the color is gorgeous!  This top is so warm and snuggly and cute! Not only does it look fabulous with loose pants (like those featured on the model), but it will look great with jeans!  The fabric on this top is very soft inside and out. The bottom of the top has a neat detail of some extra fabric hanging out, that is a bit uneven.  It really just adds a bit of subtle flair to this top.  The applique on the front is sewn on very well.  When I inspected it, I couldn't see any places that would come off, fold, or be problematic.  The sleeves came to just above my wrists, and the bottom came to right above my hips.  It is a wide boxy fit.  The fabric has enough softness and movement that you don't end up looking like you are wearing a cube, though.  This top will be very warm and cozy all winter!\n\nI am 5'3\" and 130 pounds, usually wearing US size 4 / small. I ordered the small in this top, and it is perfect. When you are buying these clothes, always read the size charts provided by the company in the garment details section. I have some of their clothes in a small, medium, and large. I am always careful when ordering clothing online, especially Asian sized clothing, and order up. Because this top is supposed to be large on you, I was not worried about getting them too large. I feel like in clothing that is supposed to be huge and flowy like these, too big is okay. The measurements of the fabric are true, so you can make an accurate judgement as to what size to order. Don't just assume a size, and you'll be happy every time!\n\nI love the detail work on this top! The applique, the quilting, the notched collar, and the fabric trim at the bottom of the top all add up to a fall / winter weight top that is really neat! I really love that this top, as well as their other garments, is made with quality fabric. These garments have a high price point, but you are definitely getting your money's worth. These clothes will last for a long time!\n\nI enjoy wearing clothes that have some sort of fun pizzazz to them - something others don't own, and can't be bought at the mall. This top definitely fits that bill!  This also looks cute over a loose longer dress, over a T-shirt, with long or short skirts, and a variety of pants. Very versatile!\n\nI have included some pictures of how the top fits, include a more close up selfie, so you can see the applique work and the color.\n\nI know I am gushing over the clothes by this company, but I am not affiliated with them in any way.  I just really really love their clothing!  This top is fabulous!  Five stars!", "summary": "I love the detail work on this top!
