The material is thin, polished, basket-woven paper straw which has a soft flexibility and is actually quite tough and water-resistant.  The comfortable elasticized headband holds it securely even with the headband tucked inside, which is how I wear it in all but the windiest conditions.  My headsize is 22-1/4 inches or 56.5 cm diameter, and there is room for someone with a larger headsize, perhaps an inch or more.  The brim is adjustable, and there is a wire sewn into the edge so you can flatten or increase the roll.  Along with the light weight, I most like this hat for its venting, which is very effective.\n\nAnother reviewer seems put off by the fact that this is a product made from paper.  I have produced handmade papers in several workshops over the years.  I  can assure you that many fibrous materials are used to make all kinds of paper, and some of them are extremely strong ... stronger, even, than natural straw.\n\nUPDATE 2017: Four years since I bought this hat, and it has held up amazingly well.

We generally order up to be sure that the length is ok for her, especially with the top.  It fits her a bit loose, but snug enough - and most importanly, long enough to cover her mid section when she moves around!  Definitely size up when ordering.  We love the print - but are unfortunately not as pleased with the quality of the fabric.  There are generally two ways to make garments with prints -- one where the fibers are woven of different colors to make up the print, and the other where the fibers are woven of one color with a print applied to the finished product.  This PJ is the latter - wherein the print looks great until you actually wear it and it stretches, and then the print becomes distorted because the knit rows pull apart and show the plain white knit of the fabric in the middle of the print.  Anywhere that the PJs bend at all - think bottom, knees, elbows -- ends up looking worn out and faded just because of the way the print is applied to the cotton knit.  But, other than this, our daughter loves them -- they are comfortable for her, and she loves the print.  She doesn't notice how bad it ends up looking after she wears them for awhile.  Other than this issue with the fabric/ print, the quality of the product is just fine.  The cotton is not super thick, which is actually good for our daughter.  Overall, the product is fine - especially for the relatively low price tag.

It arrived earlier than expected and fit well across the chest.

For the 3/4 length, I was disappointed that Amazon did not have the women's size 7 - 8.5 as I order a fair amount of other things on Amazaon, and had to order these elsewhere.  I have received them from another source, and will comment that the front edge could be a little thinner for a more comfortable feel and transition beneath the ball of the foot. I measured that thickness to be about 1/8\" or 3.5 mm.  The height of the arch support reaches just over 1\" without a foot in it.  Length measured from the middle is 6 3/4\" front to back, widest part of heel cup area measures 2.5.\"  The Birkenstock 3/4 length orthotics are thinner at the front edge, so there is a better transition there.  But they are more expensive than Powerstep.  The Powerstep insoles have the leather on top, which creates a very comfortable feel.  They seem to be quite sturdy.  They work well with a 1/2\" to 3/4\" heel lift that I have to wear in one shoe, and that is with a low-heeled dress sandal, no built-in orthotic support, with a \"gladiator\" type of heel back (no ties) to keep the orthotics in place without adding adhesive or velcro.

I dislike shopping for bras. I'm understating my disdain to keep this review professional. I found a brand I love for work and dress, but they are very expensive and I have been looking for a good comfortable moderately priced bra to wear when I'm working from home, gardening, doing yoga, walking or running to the store. Did not want a sports bra because they smash in and give the appearance of a unibosom. I saw an ad for Coobie bras in a little magazine, was intrigued, looked up reviews on Amazon which were mostly positive, took the plunge and ordered some. I have it on right now and love it. Could easily sleep in it. This one is my absolute favorite of the different styles I ordered. I don't know why other reviewers thought the shape looked odd because on me it's as natural look as I had as a perky younger woman, sans bra. There may be a slight teardrop shape to it but not noticeable at all under clothes, and I think that's a natural look anyway. I am very average weight to height, ordered a small and normally wear 32-34D, depending on brand, size 2-4 clothes.

Holt", "reviewText": "The laptop pocket fit my Dell XPS12 easily and I appreciate that it has a separate padded pocket for my tablet.  I was specifically looking for a bag without a lot of bulk as I like to travel light.  It has lots of pockets: one on the flap, one zip up pocket and 3 open pockets under the flap (2 of which are padded), and a pocket on the back.  That being said, other than the pocket for the laptop itself all the other pockets are very flat and won't hold a lot of bulky items.  If you're looking for a laptop bag that can carry around a few other items this is a great bag.  If you're looking for a bag that can carry everything plus a laptop then this won't do to the job.\n\nMy only real concern is that the plastic buckles on the front of the bag and the strap feel very flimsy.  I can see that they would wear down and possibly even break with a lot of rough use.  I also wish it had side pockets for things like water bottles or an umbrella, but like I said, this isn't a bag that holds everything.  I bought it specifically to carry my work laptop between home and the office so I think it'll be fine for that application but I'm not sure it would stand up to lots of heavy use.", "summary": "Nice for the price, but doesn't feel sturdy", "unixReviewTime": 1414627200}

These are FANTASTIC sunglasses and for the price I paid they are even more AMAZING. The sunglasses are polarized and fit perfectly - they even have hinged arms that can flex out so they don't fit too tightly on your head. True story, this past weekend I went to a beach wedding here in Florida and wore these glasses. No fewer than 5 people grabbed them from me at some point during the day/night and put them on and told me they were the clearest glasses they ever wore. This actually got annoying later on in the evening when multiple people grabbed my shades and took them to the dance floor. You see, I was going boating the next morning and wanted to have my polarized sunglasses with me - normally I would just walk away from a $15 pair but NO...I stood there like an idiot and waited for these glasses to make their way way back to me. Glad I did because they were ideal on the water the next day and I still love them today.

The grommets are just fine, the belt hasn't come apart in any places, and the \"missing holes\" that others complain about don't look bad at all--in fact, I never even noticed it (on my belt it's about 3\" or barely three sets of grommet holes which would normally be covered up with the overhang--see photo). That said, it is starting to get slightly worn where I usually place the buckle, but that's to be expected with pretty much any belt.\n\nAnd I'd say that it runs big. I originally ordered the XL when I had about a 42\" waist and it was big enough to wear 80's style. Now that I've lost weight and have a 38\" waist, I have about 8\" overhang and it's annoying so I'm back to order a smaller size (I could just cut this one down but for the price I'll just order a smaller one) so I'll be ordering a Medium which I hope fits correctly.\n\nThe XL is 50\" long from tip of silver buckle to the end of the leather.\n\nEDITED 3/19/16 TO ADD: I received the Medium belt and it was way too small. The M is 40\" long from the tip of the silver buckle to the end of the leather. So, size 14 jeans, 190#, needs a size Large.\n\nEDITED 3/24/16 TO ADD: I received the Large belt and it's actually just about right. It is 45.5\" long from the tip of the silver buckle to the end of the leather and once buckled, there's about 3-4\" of overhang. HOWEVER, the holes are spaced ever-so-slightly differently than the XL belt! I thought I was imagining it at first BECAUSE WHY WOULD THEY BE DIFFERENT? But when I placed the belts next to each other it became obvious (see photo). For every nine sets of holes in the XL belt, the L belt only has eight. That might not seem like that big of a deal, but it was enough for me to notice when I tried to buckle the belt for the first time. Also, as you can see in another picture, the L belt has MUCH more \"empty\" space (space without holes) on the belt than the XL did. I could barely notice it on the XL belt when I was wearing it, but it's much more noticeable on the L belt.\n\nAll that said, it's still a great belt for the price. But because of the inconsistencies I've lowered rating to four stars.", "summary": "Great belt for the price! Still looks good after wearing 2-3x a week for 6 months.

Mine came in good condition with no pieces missing. There is some glue residue on the bigger plastic beads, but nothing too noticeable. The reason I'm returning is because in person, the piece looks like a watermelon. The turquoise stones read more green than blue, and the bigger stones are definitely red and NOT coral. The previous reviews were correct in stating that the beads are RED. But you should also know that the smaller stones are more green than blue. Given the shape of the piece, I would just feel like I was wearing a bedazzled watermelon around my neck. Looking at the picture on my laptop, I see the pretty bluish turquoise and coral beads, and even though I was warned that the beads were RED, watermelon wedge never crossed my mind. I'm kicking myself for not seeing this before I checked out. It's not a bad piece, just not for me.

My size before that was a 10 1/2 EEE.\n\nOne of my big problems with diabetic neuropathy is that my shoes easily slip off my feet since I can no longer feel them.. it's amazing what happens when you lose your feeling - shoes, and socks, just slip right off your feet without you even knowing it.  Anyway, I needed a shoe wide enough to handle a 7E width on one foot, while staying on a 3E right foot.  Though about one size too long, they stay on the majority of the time and fit both feet comfortably.\n\nMy biggest problem with the shoes is the design.  Due to the curvature of the shoes, it is very difficult to tell which is left and which is right.  In fact, they look rather like a pair of big ol' clown shoes, as one person said.  Other than the goofy look, they work for me at a price that didn't break the bank!  I recommend them.\n\n**** UPDATE (10/15/2014)****  The heel is as loose and torn up as a 40 year old pair of elastic briefs already.

There's already a wax comb in that pocket taking up space, and a few more standard pockets for keys, wallet and phone would be nice. Not everyone is actually going to wear these for surfing.

But, for 12 bucks, I have no complaints.\nA couple things to note, the metal links are mildly darker than they appear in the picture. Also, the pictures posted by the seller are a little misleading. In the pictures, the watch looks like it has a solid black face that then lights up to give you the time. It actuality, you can see the 12 outer quadrilaterals and 4 inner white triangles at all times. These then turn blue / red when pushed to give you the time.\nAnother reviewer mentioned it running small. Im a pretty chunky guy and it fit on my wrist with space to spare.\nAnd, thank you to oldgoldone for instructions as to how to set the watch because instructions are not included.\nFinally, it took about a month to get the states from Hong Kong.

Then offered  me to choose another item from her link products.  There are not many items that i like from her products but one dress.  So i took the courage to replace it with that item.  The item I chose is a brand name Miusol and once again when seller shipped it to me, it was not miusol brand.  The item she sent me is another cheap material see through dress.  It has loose threads all over and a spot in d front of the dress and awkward put together dress.  VERY CHEAP!!! i want  my money back.

This bag is soft and supple and not a stiff bag for being man made material. Tablet fits perfect in the bag. One of the featured I really liked was the Top Flap zippered compartment. I ended up using to put my sunglasses all the time. The zippered partition style compartment at times felt in the way when I really wanted to load the bag for traveling.  Another featured I liked was the the flap covered that hid the main zipper. So even if you use it as a backpack someone can't just stick their hands into the main interior of the bag. (not a failsafe deterrent for expert but helps).\nThis bag was a temp solution for me while I was using crutches but love it enough to continue using it. I looked at other comparable bags but you would have to pay twice to three times as much for a similar style. So far it's been able to take the abuse without losing stitches or tearing.

First is that it is not designed to fit all luggage well, when you use the pull-out panel that allows it to grip the bars of a rolling bag's extended handles.  If you have a non-Briggs & Riley bag, it won't line up well and isn't very secure.  Which brings me to issues #2:  the pull-out panel just pulled completely off, so that I can't attach it to my luggage at all.  Now I have to send it back in for repair (there are no stores to take it to in Austin, which isn't a small town.)  I have to do this at my expense.  Poor design.\n\nI really liked my previous Briggs & Riley rolling computer bag, but I started a new job and wanted something a little slimmer.  Overall it's a very well-built and well-designed product with only one complaint.  The lining gets caught in the zipper almost every time I zip up the main compartment from the sides.  I've learned to be extremely careful, but still it's a hassle when you're zipping up at and airport because they're boarding a plane.", "summary": "Update:  Wish this were better", "unixReviewTime": 1432080000}

I can't complain about the price, they are very affordable, and they were shipped quickly. I got one of each color, with some that had slight variations, such as three different shades of pink. Overall, I got a light and a dark of each color with a crystal, an AB, and a hematite. The bar is a bit long but i have a nose that can accommodate that. I wouldn't recommend these for folks with thin nostrils or a septum that extends below the outer edge of the nostril. The bar and curve will be regularly visible, and metallic boogies aren't really cute.\n\nMy main issue is with the stones. They are glued on, but some are glued on at very wonky angles, looking like they will fall off at any minute, sideways, crooked, off-center. I am also super bummed because my favorite color stone has a large dab of glue on the outside of the metal cup, the part that rests against my nose. I had a HUGE allergic reaction to the glue, and I tried on 3 separate occasions to make sure it was the glue I was reacting to. The skin around the piercing became red and inflamed, painful to the touch, all that other good stuff that looks like an infection. That didn't happen with any of the other pieces which didn't have glue on the outside. If you don't have sensitive skin, or you get pieces without glue spills, you should be fine. I haven't had any reactions to the metal itself, which was my main concern.\n\nAll in all, it's a good bargain and the stones are pretty, but there are a couple things to watch out for. Definitely don't expect to get 20 pieces in pristine condition.", "summary": "Bargain price, but crooked stones and allergic reaction to the glue", "unixReviewTime": 1439510400}

The actual holsters were just small black tubes where i guess your guns are supposed to go..a really small set of guns. When I slid the holsters up on my thighs, it had a nice caterpillar effect going on. I am athletically built and fit but those straps really just dug right into my skin. I could tell I wouldn't have been able to wear them very long without chaffing or having constant elastic band pain. I ended up putting together my own costume for less that looks way more badass. I would suggest to skip this costume option and make your own. Saves money and you will look better. You can even find real thigh gun holsters that are decently priced on amazon that are delivered through prime.

Both have kept immaculate time, the function buttons are easy to use and having standard hands for tracking time on a heart or respiratory rate, along with a stopwatch for tracking I.V. flow is excellent, as is having the digital 12/24 hour clock (easily switched between) gives me a perfect snapshot (seconds are clear and in the center digital box) for writing down times of procedures. I have tiny, tiny wrists for a man, and this watch both fits very well and is unbelievably comfortable. it is also adjustable to a much bigger wrist as well. Overall build quality is excellent, rear battery cover is screwed on with four phillips head screws, I can easily submerge the watch for handwashing without any concerns. Lots of compliments as well. Overall, I'll be buying this watch every couple years (on the whole, cheaper than a $200 watch that lasts ten years)  until I can no longer buy it, because there is literally not a single complaint I have about it. All the digital displays are crystal clear and the illuminate function illuminates all the digital displays. If this watch came with a proper sapphire glass face, I'd argue that it would be easily worth $80-100. I've been buying cheap chinese watches for a while since I'm just too hard on watches to spend any more, and this is the only one that truly has no \"quirks\" inherent to the idea of a dirt cheap watch.", "summary": "Fantastic watch, long term review.", "unixReviewTime": 1448841600}

As for the paint it is pretty good I wouldn't say it is top notch gold plated either but decent as can be. The black on it is like acrylic pain and dosent scratch as much the pyramid itself is holding up for me ive scraped it here and there and so far i don't see any problems with the paint. The thing that kind of disappointed me was the actual band of the ring the part that stretches around your finger. It kind of feels cheap and not as comfortable when you have medium sized fingers. All in all it is an ok buy the only problems i have with it is the price i feel like thats way to high then again free shipping, and the quality of the band feels like i could have made it myself. So i will give it a 5/5 as the first reviewer would i buy this again maybe if it was cheaper.

The 2014 version has an easier plastic clip action for the buckle, which is even more comfortable.  Also, I like the latest \"pleather\" look.  It's the only belt I ever wear - no belly bulge and adjustable.\n\nUsually I skip wearing a belt, as the buckle just makes my stomach look fatter - and who needs that??  But this belt is awesome - a perfectly flat buckle, no extra bulk through your jean loops.  Great for anyone who wants to look 5 pounds thinner, no dieting required.  It even comes with adjustment tricks so you can size it perfectly.  I highly recommend and plan to order more to give as gifts.  Note:  The sizing isn't as straightforward as it looks, since the belt is unisex.  I didn't realize this when I ordered off the website. Since the belt is adjustable, it wasn't a problem.  But next time I'll be aware that a medium-sized female can order a \"small\" in this belt size.", "summary": "Only belt I wear!", "unixReviewTime": 1370563200}

Its tall official leather straps are very comfortable on the underside on your hand and well polished on the outer  the studs are firmly attached as well. the display is not as disappointed as i taught from the sellers pictures, its just the right size and has a professional design and feel, the straps are not too tall or short  either  its actually the right length for adjusting on different wrist size. it basically works with all my wardrobe and is going over 8 months of use now and still looks and feel the same as brand new and the nice brown shade on the straps  has not  neither has the bronze color on the face change either  which is most important. I would definitely recommend this product to any female wanting a simple and professional look", "summary": "Awesome product", "unixReviewTime": 1374019200}

The \"waist\" stitching is very flattering on my figure.\n\nCons:  Cheap zipper - it takes several tries to get the connection so the zipper will close.  After that, it's fine, but it's difficult almost every time. (This is what disappoints me/ticks me off the most about this sweater.  For the money, give me a YYK zipper and no hassles!\nThe VVK zipper is a cheap knockoff.  A quotation below is from the VVK zipper webpage.  Having just looked this up, I'm getting more and more disappointed.\n\"Stock Zippers! Nylon and Derlin Zippers for only 2 Eur / kg; Metal Zippers for only 5 Eur / kg ... VVK production is tested and gained I class OEKO-TEX sertificate.\"\n(Read: Authentic Irish Sweaters with cheap Chinese zippers.)\n\nThe cost of 2.2 pounds of VVK zippers is about $2.36.\n\nA single 18\" YKK zipper is $6.25 and is top quality.\nThis cheap zipper is outrageous on a piece of clothing this expensive.\n\nColor: On my monitor, it looks like it's brown.  It's actually charcoal.\nAlso, there are random red plastic pieces and random white threads woven into the pattern.\n\nFit:  it fits quite well in the chest and is true to size.  However, it looks like a *bell* around my hips.  It's far beyond the measurement it should be.\n\nI am 5' 11\", 200 lbs, 46x37x44 (approximately).\n\nPattern:  Looking at the photo with the white turtleneck sweater below, you can not see the white turtleneck through the pattern.  That is not the case and the white clearly shows through.  I am not pleased with that. I think the elbows will wear out faster than you would expect.\n\n\"Coat\" is wayyy to generous a term for this sweater.\nI thought it was a sweater coat, but the fact that the pattern is loosely stitched and you can see the top you're wearing underneath makes the statement \"sweater coat\" untrue.\nIt may be fine for an evening chill while sitting on the deck, but I would not trust it to be sufficient to wear throughout a fall football game in its entirety.\n\nMerino wool:  The tag inside touts the history and softness of Merino wool.\nThe history may be correct for what they thought was soft hundreds of years ago.\nI LOVE wool.  Love it!  But...\n\nThis is scratchy and if you are sensitive to touch sensations, you won't like it.  Do count on wearing a turtleneck under it if you decide to take the leap.\nI did expect it to be much softer that it is.  It feels like the wool sweaters I bought in Greece in 1994 that were made 100% by hand by women in remote villages.\nThat being said, this is authentic wool.  It feels like those sweaters do.  That feeling is not for everyone.\n\nThis has a more rustic look and feel than you would expect based on the refined look of the model in the photo.\nIt is not soft.\nIt does look like light colored dog hair is all over it (it's the wool, not dog hair, but that's what it looks like).\n\nI began this review at 3.5 stars just because I love the style so much. Then as I wrote my review, I dropped it to 3 stars.\nAfter looking up the zippers, I'm dropping it to 3 stars.\n\nWhy all this fuss about zippers?\nIf you're in a rush, this will slow you down and you will get frustrated.  I would end up giving up if I were in a hurry and leave with it unzipped or swap it for a different outer layer.\n\nIf your clothing gets stuck, cheap zippers are harder to correct and more likely to tear up your garment.\n\nNo, I don't work in the zipper industry or own any stock.  I like excellent products and am so tired of the \"Big Mac\" affect where the photos look great but you end up with a slipshod version of what was pictured.\n\nOverall, that's my impression.\n\nRemember, I love wool. I have a lot of it - I'm always cold.\n\nFor the kind of money being charged for this piece, you could look up a boutique in Ireland and get the real deal for a comparable price and get way better quality.\nThat's what I'm going to do.\n\nHappy shopping...somewhere else.\n\n***Updated:\nI did shop outside of Amazon.  The sweaters sold here are authentic.\nI think the one I ordered may have flaws that others don't.  I love the design and will return form an exchange.", "summary": "5 stars is a better rating.

It's all in one piece... and if you don't lay it on your face perfectly the very first time (almost impossible) then you will find it's horrible to try and reposition it. It got stuck to my eyelid so I tried to reposition it because being able to see is kind of important and while trying to adjust the product, it stuck to itself, my face and fingers resulting in a wadded-up ball of Xotic Eyes crap.\nI tried with this product..  I've had great success with other Xotic Eyes items... but this was a difficult ridiculous mess that I ended up throwing in the trash.\nI saw one user who recommended cutting the product in half horizontally and I would absolutely take that advice if you purchase this item. Cutting the two large pieces into 4 will help you avoid some of the extremely frustrating issues associated with this item.

The best I've ever owned. I really wasn't into upscale wallets in the past, but was getting tired of my obsolete-trend design wallet that was also very thick and wide for no reason. I used to keep it in my back pocket but it would give me pain on my opposite butt cheek, so I have sense switch to front pocket wear indefinitely. I also use this technique to ward off pick-pocketers, because nobody in their right mind is going to try to reach inside of your front pocket to gain access to your wallet.\n\nThis slim fit, front pocket wallet is excellent because it has a hard leather outer shell. I have owned the wallet for a couple of months now and unfortunately it is bending a bit on the corners, but with the cards inside it keeps the middle crisp and firm. I am glad they did not go with a softer and bendable leather as the wallet would not look as sleek and also be harder to remove from your pocket since it would contour to your thigh, and also generally would not withstand the trials of daily use. The interior leather--I got the eye-catching orange version, which has unfortunately seemed to have been discontinued--is a bit thin and soft for my liking. It is great for being able to easily remove and insert cards, but it seems they may be able to tear more easily and not have enough tensile strength to really grip onto the cards so that they don't accidentally fall out. So far this has not been a problem, and it surprisingly grips the credit cards better than i originally expected.\n\nThe money clip is \"money,\" aka genius. It has a locking mechanism that is quite satisfying to click open and shut, and it is just tight enough to hold all the dollar bills you need. The lock is a sense of security and that it will hold every time. I have not dealt with money clips before, but used to think they were tacky or for old guys. This money clip is sexy and modern and minimally elegant. It makes the wallet even lower-profile, since most of the time I am not carrying cash anyway. It is truly the design for the future generation: more credit card dependent and no cash, and not too many \"loyalty cards\" or coupons.\n\nSophisticated design and quality product. I also like that it was designed in Australia, because I feel Australians have good taste. I'm not sure where it is made, hopefully in the same country but I doubt it, since it does not advertise specifically.\n\nThe gift box is one of the best gift boxes I've opened: comparable to the quality craftsmanship of the iphone box. The presentation is really half the product, and I must confess I bought it because I thought it would be fun to own a small piece of astroturf/synthetic grass. My complaint here is that the grass is cut a bit small and leaves negative space in the box, and seems like more of an afterthought.

I mean, it was the same shirt with the same colors (heather gray, with black and yellow stripes), but the way that the stripes were arranged was very different. It looked almost NOTHING like the shirt I was interested in, and I didn't like the new look AT ALL! And to me, $27 for a shirt is only reasonable if it's EXACTLY 100% the size, color AND design you're looking for.\n\nSo it sat in my list for a while until I finally decided to take the risk and grab the shirt anyway. I'm glad I did!\n\nThe shirt is not EXACTLY like the first picture I'd seen, but just barely. The weirdest thing, though, is that once I clicked the \"Purchase\" link, there was a THIRD photo, different from the previous two, that showed up in my order confirmation page! Same colors, same design but different (and uglier) layout.\n\nAnyway, I'm pretty sure the shirts are kind of randomly put together, regarding the orientation of the stripes, and I just lucked out that I got one that was very close to what I was actually looking for...I don't know.\n\nI would have given this 5 stars if not for the whole issue with the product photos. Maybe I'll post one myself of my shirt.\n\n[EDIT: I guess they don't want customers posting their own photos because that feature is not available for this product]", "summary": "Cool shirt!", "unixReviewTime": 1377475200}

Just keep on doing it!\n\nREAL CONS:\nBecause they are soooo light and form fitting, they will not protect you from morons that will cleat you--ouch on top!\nLikewise, if you're an enforcer type player and are brutish in dispensing hard tackles and getting stuck in on 50/50 balls, these won't punish the opponent as well as real cleats... (but if you were such a meat head you probably can't read reviews very well and aren't viewing this part of my comment)\nIf you compete and get cleated a lot by a**holes in the competition (see above), these will likely not last a full season (but I've not seen any evidence of seams splitting or tearing at the construction welds in my previous pairs) because these shoes are not as durable as real leather and will tear on top or wherever you take direct and consistent abuse.\n\nAnd this means even though you want to hold the ball and touch it 30 times with these on, don't dribble like a ball hog and get dispossessed all the time...\n\nGeez!

I will have to disassemble them and torque the nuts correctly to avoid premature wear on the internal bearings. I will need to buy a special tool to take them apart or have that done at a bike shop.\n 2) Shoes have holes for both mountain bike and road bike cleats. My left shoe had the metal Mountain Bike cleat receiver lose and since I am using Road bike cleats it was rattling inside the sole like a maraca (very annoying).

But rereading the description, I think I'm justified in finding it inaccurate.\n\nI have these pants from Express that I love. They're jeggings, in that they are totally comfy and stretchy, but they don't look a thing like leggings. They just look like jeans. That's what I wanted out of these pants too.\n\nWell, heads up: These pants do not look like jeans. They look like leggings. The fabric feels and stretches like leggings. The stitching screams leggings. The button at the top looks like the cheesy plastic buttons on children's clothes. There is nothing jean-like about them. Fake pockets and zip flies are not unique to jeans, and therefore, in my opinion, do not give you license to say that something is \"like jeans.\" For something to be like jeans, it needs to be able to imitate the defining factor in jeans, which is *denim.* If you say \"like jeans\" and don't mean \"like denim\" you're deliberately misleading people. These are not jeggings. These are leggings. Let's call a spade a spade.\n\nI was so appalled at the cheap look of these pants that I didn't even try them on. However, I did notice that they appear to be very low rise as well. I don't tend to find pants that sit on or below my hip bones comfortable to wear, in the sense that they are very restricting in the crotch area and I'm constantly hiking them up. Such a low rise in pants with this kind of fabric makes me think that they put the wearer at serious risk for camel-toe.\n\nGiven that I am a self-respecting human being who does not wear leggings out of the house pretending they're pants, I could not keep these. I had to send them back.", "summary": "These are nothing like jeans", "unixReviewTime": 1398384000}

I would give it 5 stars, but there were some minor set backs, all in all it's a great skirt. The image displays the real life one pretty accurately, but I'll go into some brief details about it:\n\nPros: It fits as expected, I wear a size 4 in women's jeans and bought the medium knowing it'd be snug based upon the style. It's a great color that you can pretty much wear with any top if you're willing to experiment with some bold colors! The frontal bow design was a bit flat from packaging, but starting to ruffle out once I wore it a few times.\n\nCons: I wanted to give this a 5 start rating just because I really love this skirt, but I want to be realistic and honest. These types of skirts are supposed to zip up to your upper hip, pretty much meeting up with your belly button. But I noticed when I walk in this skirt that it gradually starts to slip up and eventually turn into a super mini skirt. So it can get awkward when you're trying to walk around in public and tugging at your skirt the whole time. Also, the material is pretty sheer. I highly advise not wearing anything black under there and recommend wearing a light colored thong. If you want to wear nothing under there, go for it, not really my cup of tea but be ready to flash a few people as the skirt starts to rise!\n\nSo to recap, the skirt is great, fits as expected, matches the image, but rises when you walk and is made from a pretty sheer material, so be ready to hide those undies.", "summary": "Love this skirt.", "unixReviewTime": 1400544000}

Why do they look green in the picture? Because it is totally photoshopped to change the color of the suit, and not an actual picture of the \"green\" suit. However, with this in mind, the jewels were actually much prettier in person. They have little diamonds in them and are so delicate and girly. Probably my favorite part of the suit.\n-the green color is actually teal. It is so pretty, if you like teal then you will not be disappointed. But it is not green at all, it is more blue than green.\n\nThe cons:\n-way too small. The cups are very very close together, and the bottoms are realllllly little. I am 5'1, 125lbs and I had way more booty showing in the back than I was comfortable with. Also, the cups are rigidly formed, so if your chest doesn't line up with them you end up looking very strange, with lots of side boob and too oddly fitting cups hovering in the middle of your chest. This top will NOT work for busty women, it is simply too small and rigidly formed.\n- the worst part, and the reason I am returning this rather than giving it to a friend, is that the plastic liner that is in the bottoms (the sanitary liner they put in all suits for when people try them on) was obviously in there for a very long time, because when I tried to remove it all the advise stayed behind on the suit. It was like baked on. It was very sticky and I couldn't think of any way to get a giant strip of adhesive off the bottoms, so I'm returning this. Almost immediately after trying to remove the plastic liner the bottoms started to get stuck in the adhesive left behind and get all gummed up. Not cool.\n\nSo, three stars for the fabric, jewled accents, and for any girl petite enough to pull this off. But ultimately a bad fit for my body and a defective product.", "summary": "Nice material, defective product", "unixReviewTime": 1383436800}

Looks just like the picture! Wore it the first day to work. I work 12 hour shifts. The chain with the clasp stretched and came apart once, but I was leaning on the back of a chair and putting pressure on it. Easy fix with some needle nose pliars. What I love about this kind of jewelry is that it is not stretchy. I bought a chocker necklace at Hot Topic for about 5 times the price of this and the lace was elastic and after the first time I wore it I have to tie it then clasp it to make it sit on my neck correctly now. It's such a hassle that I rarely wear it. But this holds its shape. I do a lot of paperwork/writing/typing so the chain that makes it the slave bracelet bothers me. I am thinking about taking it off and use it as a separate ring and bracelet. I have several pieces of this jewelry so far and I can mix and match it to my hearts content. The price makes it worth it as one piece or two. I have not had the problem of the 'gem' separating from the rest yet, but a dab of good glue that you probably already have laying around your house would fix that. In my experience with cheaper jewelry, this is worth it. Whether you buy it to wear once with a costume, or like me you wear it on a more regular basis, I would recommend it. (I can see, however, if you have a very skinny wrist it might be too big. Or if you have a very wide wrist it may look a bit odd if you wear it as jewelry instead of a costume. It is crochet though so for a skinny wrist it can hook through that. And it has a long chain at the clasp so it could potentially fit a very wide wrist.) One thing to bear in mind, it takes several weeks to arrive. So if you want it for a special occasion order early.", "summary": "I love it! Looks just like the picture", "unixReviewTime": 1429056000}

They claim it have an internal 8G harddrive, every one know before you add data to a HD it have to be format first, then add the data/file ETC. this did not happen, here is the kicker, reading the instruction this sunglasses 4in1 Dv88 was manufacture in 2012.\nI was shock after reading this information. I call Amazon informing them I need to send this piece of crap back to the seller, after a few email from me, and Amazon to the seller they decided for me to send the item back to them, however, I have to pay the postage, which again I did not mind,you loose some you win sum, pack the item with all the accessories it came with, went to UPS to post item back to seller, another surprise.\nIf I want to send the package back to the seller it will cost me $60: 92, I almost had a heartache, I pay $67:95, for this lousy piece of junk,,I will end up loosing over $128 plus, here is where I draw the line,there is absoutely no way on this green earth am paying to ship this junk back to CHINA, maybe tomorrow, but NOT today.\nThe sell is not here in the states which they claim to be. Plain and simple, if there was a way to give this product a minus star, it will received the MAX. I almost forgot, the control next to your ear, the few minutes it is on it get very warm, Words to the wise stay away from this company  Sherryshop. Am still waiting on a reply from them through Amazon for them to pay the postage. I hope my review will be helpful to future buyers.

They don't work for me. These seemed to be very well made (good stitching, no errant threads, felt very cotton-y), fit almost exactly like the photos. I won't be buying them in a small because the fit was far more stiff, not stretchy or more form-fitting. It literally fit quite like the picture. It has proper stretch, but it is definitely more of a woman's shirt than it is a junior's, too much cotton, not enough polyester or something. It was fairly soft, again, given its cotton nature (I did not check the tag for the exact ingredients), though not as soft as I'd like. I also like my sleeves to be more 'capped' than this typical short-sleeve - I expected the fit to be different on me because of the not-stretchy fabric and size of the not-junior's shirt. The shoulders were almost constructed in my opinion (like they'd been on wire hangers or had padding in the shoulders); I didn't think it was very flattering. The shirts were extremely long - almost a dress for me (5'7\") and I don't care for that. It's one thing to cover your behind in jeans when you squat down, it's another to be nearly a dress but not long enough to wear with jeggings, etc. I didn't see the point of having so long and cumbersome a shirt. Also, some shirts cost more than others; I'm not sure why.\n\nI returned them and received an email saying that I would get my refund, but I did not have to return the shirts because it would cost me to ship them. So I got my refund and got to keep two of three shirts!\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: I attempted to return these shirts FOUR TIMES. After their promise to get back to you within 48 hours, which never happened. The second time, I was refunded for the two shirts (and got to keep them). The third time, I received an entirely differently email with an unpaid returns label. The fourth time, I sent a specific, polite email through Amazon, detailing my problem. I said that I was confused and irritated and simply wanted my money back ($6 for shipping on a $9 shirt?). I informed them that I had not yet posted a review on Amazon. I HAVE NOT HEARD BACK!

If you are more straight up and down it should fit nicely.\nAlso the material in the top is somewhat stretchy so it's flexible on fit through the shoulders and bust.  Nice touch there.  I'll really enjoy wearing.  It did come wrinkled and the wrinkles haven't fallen out so will need ironing with a cool iron (iron carefully with low heat, from the back side, given the fabric).  I don't mind that for such a cute costume, and it's not unexpected so I didn't count off for that.\nOnly minor negative was the headband seems small and pretty useless, but I wasn't planning on wearing it anyway.

Its easy to see even in bright sunlight for me, and the night light is great at night.  This watch is VERY COOL.\n\nUPDATE:  I had one issue.  One of the new band's attachment screws came loose during use, and fell out.  The screw that came with the original band isn't the exact right length for the accessory rubber band, so I contacted Suunto (yes, Finland) through their website, and requested a new set of screws.  They sent them, and I just received them yesterday.  It took about 5 weeks, which they informed me up front.  During my wait, I used the original bands screws, but couldn't tighten all the way, as tight length is too short for the accessory band.  I have now used BLUE LOCTITE on all 4 band screws, and have not had any issue at all with loosening...Therefore, if you do get an accessory band, my recommendation is use Loctite.  AND, by the way, all the features of this watch work great...I use the barometer function with storm warning, and works very well.  Also, the compass is great.  However, this is one of those products that you need to understand how to use it to get the most benefit.  If you are willing to study a little on its use, it becomes addictive its so good.

Well i finally have made it a reality, i bought mine at ben bridge because i want warranty and paperwork, plus im assured it is new and not refurbished and only genuine parts. This watch is BIG im 6ft 195 and it is almost too big for me . Cream dial is classy as all hell and revokes its almost obnoxious size. The warranty \"card\" isn't a card at all like i got with my tag heuer rather a ipod sized lcd screen sporting object which is turned on and has all the info stored in it from purchase date through your lifetime of service. The chronometer certificate is also a amazing document im proud to know matches the movement in my watch.. i was considering other models. Superocean heritage cream dial green bezel diving bracelet (just wasn't as impressed with the overall stature though the bracelet is pure sex) and an iwc portofino cream on leather, also the gmt avenger which is alot more cream than this watch which officially has a \"silver\" dial in person its much less eggshell and more silver than the images from breitlings site and online. The gen 2 has a diff bracelet than gen1, wider center links. Also the inner bezel the is in direct contact with the sapphire crystal doesnt have those \"slots\" that gen1 has, i like this its a much cleaner rendition of a already iconic watch and this color dial is the classiest imo... if u are considering this... please do urself a favor and check an authorized dealer... ull pay 1500$ more...easily. but enjoy the satisfaction on genuine warranty and full documentation. I almost went for a white dial milgauss but decided it was too reserved for me....i love this watch and you will too", "summary": "classy dial color", "unixReviewTime": 1413072000}

I unfortunately, did go by the amazon charting because at first I did not understand the sellers sizing chart because the measure unit was not labeled. I suggested they label the measure unit because in the US, inches are mostly used for clothing and by not labeling it, it is not obvious to some (it was in centimeters). The seller took my suggestion and did just that immediately. The seller provides excellent customer service. He will email to make sure if you received the item. I ended up not exchanging the item because it cost double the bathing suit price to ship it back. I emailed the seller and told him I changed my mind and won't return due to the shipping price.

The gemstones are very similar, but the silver has different tone, so I am not sure the pairing will work. The topaz is a pale blue, which could pass for clear depending on the light; this makes it easy to wear with different outfits.

It just looks plain. Kinda like just a t-shirt you'd pick up at Walmart for way less. I just personally don't feel like the price is worth the shirt. It's more like a $10 shirt. Also it's a little short in the front so if you are a big girl with a little bit of a lower belly that you like to keep covered - it just barely does it.\n\nThat being said - I won't be returning the shirt.
