I had high hopes for this shoe and I will probably never wear these for any reason. One of the most uncomfortable shoes I have tried on and I love boots but I have to be able to wear them for an extended time. First of all there is absolutely no cushion or padding of any kind for the feet. Big let down there. Second the bottom of the shoe is rounded so when you walk forward it almost rolls which is terrible for easy and comfort of walking. The sizing is way off. Normally I wear a 9 wide to a 9.5 regular I bought the ten and they are very constricting in every direction and the toes are really short as well. I held these up to my size 9 tennis shoes and the tebbis shoes were longer. A disappointment all around. I recieved this item at a discount for my fair and honest review.

Underwear was packed in a separate, smaller cube I already owned, and shoes, socks, hair styling tools, etc were packed around the edge.  I was limited to one rolling carry-on plus one personal item that would fit under the airline seat, and with the cubes I managed to organize and pack everything efficiently.  Wrinkling was held to a minimum and only required a slight sprinkle of water and temporary hanging to look fresh.  It was easy to pack and repack at different locations, and because everything was so compact and well organized, I never misplaced anything, nor did I stress over inspections by airport security.

It's almost a coral and the wide black zippers and black mesh makes a nice contrast.  The fabric has a diamond pattern which gives it a glossy, shimmery finish. Very elegant.\n\nI also like the sizes.  You get two large bags (15 23\" x 12 3/4\") and two medium bags (13 3/4\" x 10 3/4\".)  Since all are a generous 4\" deep, you can pack plenty of stuff without having to cram it in.\n\nThey're well made.  Rip-stop nylon holds up to a LOT of rough wear and the wide, double zippers are sturdy.  They also have substantial pulls so you can easily locate and use them.  The interior seams are bound, which is a nice touch.  Each bag has a handle on the top.  The handles are fine for me, but they are smallish.  Take note if you have large hands.\n\nAnd the twist?  Most packing cubes come with a partial mesh panel (usually in two or four corners.)  Two of these (one large, one medium) have a full mesh panel and two have no mesh at all.  I was surprised at this, but I can see that it could have some advantages.  Obviously, the advantage of mesh panels is that you can see what's in the bag without opening it.  The disadvantage is that everyone else can also see what's in there.\n\nSo it comes down to this.  If you decide to leave your heavy suitcase in the truck and just take a \"cube\" with your overnight necessities into your room, do you mind if everyone in the parking lot, lobby, and hall sees your underwear?  If you're of the \"if you've got it, flaunt it\" mindset, you'll use the cubes with full mesh.  If you think that's too much \"sharing\" you'll be happier with the closed ones.  With this set, it's your choice.\n\nActually, there's another consideration.  Many of us now use packing cubes to store out-of season or infrequently-worn clothing. The bags with no mesh are better for that purpose because they keep out dust.\n\nI think being able to choose the mesh or non-mesh is an asset. It's a nice set of sturdy, well-made, roomy packing cubes at a bargain price.\n\nFree sample provided for review.", "summary": "Very attractive packing cubes with an interesting twist", "unixReviewTime": 1455321600}

I was surprised to see that two have a mesh side (great for seeing what is in the cube) and two are solid. (One of each type in each size.)

The material is polyester and the zippers seem adequate to the job. (I haven't used the cubes for traveling yet, but I am going to take them on a trip in February and will let you know how they worked.)\n\nThe reason I gave this four stars instead of five is two-fold.\n\nFirst, I was disappointed that there was not a see-through mesh for all of them. That is important when you are rooting through your luggage looking for a particular item.\n\nSecond, these cubes feel flimsy.\n\nHowever, they are reasonably priced and roomy.", "summary": "A Nice Set for the Price", "unixReviewTime": 1453161600}

The teal color also known as \"Lake Green\" looks incredible on! But, looks even better with a great tan! I not only love the color but the option of wearing the top with or without straps is also a great idea that I really like! It's better to have options when wearing something like this because it gives the person two different looks that they can work with anytime they may choose. I like that the top can be adjusted to fit the person or activity! I personally would never want to wear this without the straps when jumping into a pool or doing something that is more active. But, if I were to just layout to catch a sun tan, I would wear this top without the straps.\n\nThere's a lot that I like about this bikini but there are also some other things that I didn't like as much. This is my reason for giving this suit 4 stars instead of 5 but I will definitely come back and update this review over time. The main thing that I noticed right away was that this bikini wasn't really sized properly because the top didn't fit the bottoms at all! Some people have a bigger chest size and require a bigger top but a normal sized bottom and here that option is not available. I do wish this was something that we were able to choose from because I think this bikini would be even better than it already is!\n\nI received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.

I really love the look and colors. The black online on the blue suit is perfect, in my opinion.  I ordered a small (size 4-6) since most of my clothing is a size 4 or small or x-small.  The top fits me perfectly, it's nice that it has the straps that can be added or removed. They don't offer a lot of support, but I imagine that they would keep it from falling off if you were actively swimming or diving into the water.  The bottoms on the other hand are WAY too tiny. I honestly can't guess what size it would fit. Maybe a size 0? I included 2 photos. One photo is the bottoms from this size small over a pair of bottoms from a size Xsmall that I wear occasionally. You can see that these small are considerably smaller than a pair of Xsmall swim bottoms.  Since the top and bottom come as a pair it may be difficult to find the perfect size unless you are a larger size on top and smaller on the bottom.

Another fact that i did not know about this necklace is that it is made of recycled items.  I absolutely love this piece.  It is so beautiful and light.  I love the story behind the company as well.

The suit arrived and its HUGE!  Boobs are way too big (and I'm a 38C), the torso's way too long, and the rucheing in the middle gives me a pear shape as opposed to enhancing my hourglass figure.  I'm assuming the suit is just too big and maybe I'm a 14?  But this was so unflattering on that I didn't even want to try to order a 14.  I ordered another size 16 miraclesuit style and I had the exact same fit issues with that one as well, giving me a pear shape, etc..  Many women just love these suits but they are not for me.  I tried on a Magicsuit at Macy's and the 16 fits more like a true 16.\n\nAll that said, I love Amazon for easy order, easy returns and am grateful I can order online and not be committed to my purchase.\n\nHope this helps!", "summary": "Beautiful suit, weird fit!", "unixReviewTime": 1516924800}

I haven't used a regular wallet in years, these wallets force you to keep the wallet clean and light. My old wallets would have all kinds of cards, receipts, etc stuffed into it. So I basically buy these wallets for the convenience, no the RFID protection. So the previous wallets I purchased were cheap, lasted about 6 months or so, got dented and dinged, and would eventually fall apart. No big deal they were cheap, just bought a new one. Well, the time came that I needed a new wallet, saw the SHARKK and thought, nice, but way too expensive for one of these wallets. But after looking at all the cheap ones I decided, what the heck, I'll give it a try. I'm so glad I did! It is noticeably heavier than the ones I had used in the past, good sign, seamed sturdier. Well, 9 months later and it is holding up great, it's very sturdy. It closes very tight, nice and secure. The finish can take lots of abuse. I keep it in my pocket with my keys, but some how it is not all scratched up like my previous wallets. It has one tiny scratch on the front, and the paint has worn off around the edges, but it still looks great. So the question I've seen come up a lot is how many cards can it hold? I have 9 cards in it and it closes nice and tight, no bulging. I can probably get a card or two more in it before it would start to bulge. If you are considering a wallet like this, pay the extra money, so worth it. Well made, great latch for a secure closing wallet. So I've commented about it closing well, that is because over time, the other wallets wouldn't close properly. I highly recommend this wallet, stop wasting money on the cheap ones and buy this one.", "summary": "Spend the money and get a quality, well made wallet...

For reference, I'm usually a size 10 in the hanes brand of girls underwear, the L size in these is pretty similar size-wise, if not a tad smaller/snugger. These are basically a \"hipster\" cut pantie. Overall these are quite comfy and well made. No loose stitching anywhere, the elastic is not rough but very smooth and soft. These are pretty cute as well, and have very faint polka dots that are not visible in the picture. They came in a nice re-sealable bag with some roses on it too, and a bunny hair-tie was included as an extra gift, how nice!\n\nAlthough the directions say to buy a size larger for \"growing girls\", I might recommend against that if you're buying these specifically for \"that time of the month\", as a snugger pair of underwear helps menstrual pads stay in place better. I wasn't really sure at first why these were specifically mentioning periods - but there's actually an additional liner that covers both the crotch area and a good portion of the back of the pantie as well to prevent break-through bleeding.\n\nUPDATE: My periods are irregular, so I recently had a \"surprise visitor\" overnight, luckily I happened to be wearing these, and although admittedly I didn't bleed all that much, the blood spots were not visible from the outside... so, the liner does work! I could see that being useful to prevent embarrassment in the gym locker room, etc. should a young girl have the same issue with irregular periods.\n\nI would have liked for the secondary liner to extend further forward. I also felt that the buttons on the front, while cute, cause a little discomfort due to the thread sticking out quite a bit on the inside where they are attached.\n\nOverall, these are great, pretty comfy, cute, and made well - I'd definitely recommend them.\n\nI received this product in exchange for writing a review.", "summary": "Cute, comfy, made well, contains additional lining on inside to prevent bleed-through, recommended", "unixReviewTime": 1465776000}

You can wear this as a dress if you're short. The problem is that its so warm, I cant see wearing it in hot weather. It might be a nice spring or autumn dress. I tried it with leggings and it looked funny cuz the dress itself is a little long on me to be a tunic.\n\n- i sent a message to the seller for a possible return/refund.

The \"FLY\" logo on the shoe can be a turnoff (corny) but not that noticeable because these are in off white (manufactures/designers have a need to put a signature stamp on fashion these days).  I was tempted to skip ordering them after asking my daughter if she like the style (a quick NO with a head shake...she's 23).  Anyway, after contemplating clicking the \"submit\" button...I decided to do it, and I am glad I did.  I typically wear a size 10, however, I ordered these in the 40 (9-9.5) since that was the only size available.  They fit perfectly and are so easy to walk in.

Many women recommended going up in size. I measured and measured and measured again, just for good measure. (Ha ha.) I followed the recommendations of going up in size. Following the chart, I should have been able to fit in a size large easily. I purchased an extra large. Felt like it would take team effort just to get the extra large on but no way was I going to ask someone to help me squish all my extra baggage in. Finally after a lot of effort, I was able to get all the hooks done up. That was a work out in itself. But it was on! Not for very long though, it was very uncomfortable trying to sit down. If I could stand up all the time it might not have been as bad. About one week later I tried it on again. This time it was much easier to get on and it felt a lot better. Actually it felt kind of good and it did make me look slimmer everywhere except at the top in the back. It appeared to move my muffin top to my upper back. This was with a tighter tank top on. Maybe with a looser top, it wouldn't have been so noticeable.  Either I lost a little weight or it stretched out a bit or maybe it was easier to get on because I'd done it before and just had it figured out. This waist trainer is very well made. It has three rows of 10 hooks that would need to take a lot of abuse to get one of the hooks to pop out. They are put in very well. There is 2.25\" between the first row of hooks and the third row. All of the seams are sewn very well. All in all this waist trainer is made with quality in mind. Even though I don't know how long it will take for me to wear it comfortably for more than an hour or so, I am glad I purchased it and I do like it. Maybe one day I will grow to love it. For now liking it is ok.\nI received this waist trainer at a discounted price for my honest review. I take my reviews serious because people count on an unbiased opinion of a product. As a consumer myself, I look to these reviews to receive more information about a product I am considering purchasing and I know I want to read the honest opinions of others. This is a perfect example of how important honest reviews are. Had I not read that a lot of women recommended going up in size I probably would have followed the chart and purchased something that was way too small for me. Buying something sight unseen makes honest reviews even more important.", "summary": "Very well made, suggest going up a size from what chart says.", "unixReviewTime": 1467849600}

Out of all the waist trainers I've tried, I like these the best because it did give me the hourglass waist shape and made my tummy look really flat. The best part?!?! It is VERY comfortable. The first wear, I had it on for almost 3 hours!!! As you wear it more, the rubber smell lessens and is more tolerable it's not a big deal. Other concern would be that if you wear something tight, the hooks are kind of visible so just be aware of that. Other than that, I really loved the product and wear it often!!

I found this one and I think it's the perfect solution. I haven't traveled with it yet, but I have blown it up. I was thrown off by the big whole for the air but it really just took 2-3 blows and it was full. When you want to deflate it you open the cap and push the flap down & it's instantly flat. It also comes with an eye mask and ear plugs which, for me, makes a complete travel kit!! It also comes in a small bag that fits all of it, so I can easily attach it to my backpack, suitcase or purse. As the picture shows it has a pocket for your phone, but doubles as a whole for when you fold the pillow up. The outside cover is REALLY soft. I'm really looking forward to when i travel so I can use it! I honestly think this is the perfect solution to having to carry around any other typical travel pillow. I've always thought they were kind of a nuisance to have to worry about or keep up with. If you like to travel, but hate to carry around a travel pillow, this pillow is the solution!!\nI received this item at a discount or for free in exchange for my honest opinion.", "summary": "Perfect solution for long flights without the hassle of typical travel pillows", "unixReviewTime": 1462924800}

I am 5 foot tall and weigh about 130 pounds...a little chunky.  I normally buy a medium top.  I was advised before I ordered that clothes from this company run small, so I ordered an extra large.  It is a little big, so if I had it to do over again I would get a large.  The material does stretch.  The sleeves are just the right length.\n\nThe material is very soft and drapes well.  The red color is rich and has an orange undertone.  The seams are well finished so they will not unravel.  With the give in the fabric the style will hide a myriad of figure flaws.  The cut outs at the shoulder give the top some va va voom, so it is sexier than a t shirt,  The fabric also has some subtle ribbing to add a little more flair.\n\nI purchased this top at a discounted rate in exchange for my fair and honest review.", "summary": "Perfect for a night on the town!!", "unixReviewTime": 1452470400}

It wasn't unbearable but uncomfortable. About 2 weeks later I had red scares under the sides of my breast. I applied Bio Oil and Ambi and kept wearing it because by now, a month after buying it I was losing inches off my waist and I could tell, so I started pulling it down further to avoid it being underneath my breast, meaning it was no longer covering my back bulges like before. Then one of the PLASTIC rods came out, I threw it away, but about 6 weeks later a metal rod came out that I kept, mind you you this is suppose to be a steel waist clincher, not plastic. What really turned me off is when after wearing it only 2 months one of the fasteners loosened, then another, and after 4 months off wearing it 2 fasteners came off and 3 were hanging on by a thread about to fall off.  I am not that big, I did purchase the extra large but as it became more and more loose I would move it from the first set of hooks to the next, which is the purpose and I was exercising and dieting so losing inches rapidly, therefore, after 4 months I had moved all the way to the 3rd row but isn't that reason most of us buy these waist trainers is to lose inches and if it's not we are waisting our money. This is a poorly made product. I ADVISE YOU DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, try one of the others. End of 9/23/17 update, by the way, I haven't worn this item since June, I just ordered another brand and remembered to update my review for this one.***\nI'm only giving this a 4 star instead of five because I've only had it for a week and not sure if it's suppose to or if it can realistically make you lose inches in your waist and stomach, but as far as clinching in your waist and stomach IT DOES THAT! It absolutely does that and it is not uncomfortable. I can sleep in it and wear it 8-10 hours at work (I don't do both because you feel like you need a relief if you wear it all day) and move around comfortably. However, it is not comfortable to sit while wearing it, I walk around all day at work so it's okay for me. You can definitely sit but you wouldn't be able to sit comfortably for 8 hours. It is not noticeable under your clothes. I have a short torso so it is perfect for me because it covers my back fat as well as comes down low enough to cover my lower stomach. I exercise but I would be comfortable exercising in this because the inside has a felt type lining which means you would have to wash it often and that may cause it to not last as long, meaning I don't know how well it would sustain constant washing. In my option this is only a waist clincher, that does just that, and not a product that would help you lose real inches. After taking it off, initially my stomach looks flatter but eventually it returns to it's true shape and size.", "summary": "UPDATED REVIEW after 4 months***Works as a waist clincher...not for weight loss", "unixReviewTime": 1486512000}

I purchased this bag in a cognac/whiskey color (I don't remember the actual name of the color) and it is a gorgeous neutral that goes with everything.

The croco embossed leather adds beautiful texture without too much flash.  This bag is structured, which makes it a good work bag if you don't have a ton of things to carry.\nI can carry a few files, pens and a resource manual for work; my personal essentials, two sets of keys, small cosmetic bag, phone, and ipad mini (or even a full size ipad) and a book to read on breaks.  This is a bag that is not quite \"large\" but is a \"large medium\" sized bag.  I'm definitely a small to smallish-medium size bag girl; I feel large bags are too cumbersome, heavy, and just plain don't flatter me.  This is different; it tapers at the top and isn't so wide at the bottom that it displaces the arm if carried over the shoulder.\nI always remove key tags from all bags and I did with this one too; its a little to flashy for me and I like to detach anything that adds weight if it isn't necessary.\nI'm very happy with this purchase and I think I will have it and love it for years to come.", "summary": "This is a beautiful and very functional bag", "unixReviewTime": 1455494400}

When I opened up the package and put it on my desk, the mat looked a little longer than 30 inches so I measured it. Despite being advertised as 30 inches in length on Amazon, the mat I received was actually 35 inches in length. This is weird since another user complained that the mat they received was only 30 inches.\n\nSince I couldn't use the mat, I had to return it. Buying this item seems like it is a waste of time since the manufacturer cannot get the mat to be measured the right length. I do not recommend this mouse pad whether you want a 30 inch or 35 inch because you might get the one that you don't want.\n\nAside from the sizing error, the mouse pad does look okay.

I'm pregnant and wanted something that looked similar to my wedding ring, and also would not turn my skin green or cause any allergic reactions... (I have issues with nickel in jewelry a lot).

My mom couldn't even tell it wasn't real!\n\nSecond, it's made of stainless steel, so it's not turning my finger green or causing any allergic reactions on my finger, which is awesome!\n\nMy ONLY complaint (And it's really not a huge deal) is that the included wedding band sits higher than the diamonds that match on the main ring. It doesn't sit higher than the center stone or anything, just a little higher than the band of smaller diamonds on the main ring. This may not bug most people, but I'm kinda OCD and I like things to match... and this bugs me...\n\nHOWEVER, the main ring is so beautiful, and it's thicker by itself, so I just don't wear the wedding band with it, and it's fine.

For a lot of people that would not be an issue, but I really don't like any shade of pink... Otherwise the top seemed OK quality, I did not see any issues with the stitching, and the style looked the same as on the pictures.\nI received this product at a discount in exchange for my review.", "summary": "Blouse is pink, not red.

I was looking for a nice Santa hat for the holidays, and spent a long time looking? I have a small head so finding hats that come in sizes is difficult. I thought I wanted a plush faux fur hat and found one that came in sizes that was lined so it wouldn't be itchy but, when it arrived it was too small and cheap looking. I then spent more time looking and found this one. It wasn't exactly what I was looking for, or thought I was but it turns out to be the best Santa hat I could've found, and it came in time for Christmas. It arrived sooner than expected and was a very nice looking hat. It is well made/high quality, and extremely comfortable to wear. I was nervous that it may not fit as my measurements fell in the medium category but, because of the ages they listed I decided on the large (which was 8-12yrs)  and was glad I did as it fit well. There is some give to the fabric so I think a medium still would've fit but, it might have been been a little snug. Most adults would probably fit in the large--I don't remember if they had an XL which would be good for someone with a larger than average head if they make one.\n Also because it is made out of a dense weave of cotton with a very soft fleece around the rim it is both warm, and yet breathable. I could wear it in the house all day Christmas without overheating, but found it to be very warm when going outside.

I have never tried one of these sticky type bras, so I was looking forward to it.

I have read other reviews of women of similar size saying they had problems, but this worked for me very well.  They came in a zippered pouch with a strap, so they can easily be stored without getting any dust or other stuff on them.  I have tried strapless bras in the past and have given up on them because they are too snug and they always feel like they are going to fall down.  I didn't experience that with this invisible bra at all- they stayed on well, were comfortable,  and did not feel like they would come off.  I did have to find the right position to put this on so that they were not noticeable under my shirt.

The curve of the cup is very, very mild and shallow, so it would fit even normal A-cup ladies.  This is not like Victoria's Secret sizing.  And band size has no bearing here.  So if you are a small-to-average build female, and you normally wear an A, B, or maybe a smallish C cup size, just do yourself a favor and order the \"D.\"  If you are normally a full C or larger, it's going to be really tough to fit yourself in here.  I'm a full C, and I can tell you exactly why you'll run into problems:\n\na)  The cups are shallow, and you don't want to give yourself that double-boob look that happens with a cup that's too small.\n\nb)  The cups are very, very close set, and that's not adjustable.  The separation is roughly 1 centimeter.  Most women I know have more than 1 centimeter separation on their ribcage, which means that this is going to give you a very unnatural, pressed-together look, which is not the same as the relaxed, full cleavage you might find with a Victoria's Secret push-up, for example.\n\nc)  The connector is very flimsy.  It's essentially just a plastic popper snap fastener (two plastic rings that click together) and I've found that they unsnap with relatively little pressure.  Can you imagine having your bra unsnap in the center during a night out or formal event?  (....BOING!)  It would be inconvenient, at least.\n\nOn the positive side, it adheres fairly well, while shielding the nipple.  I read that the manufacturer mentioned this was a 5-time-use item, and that's probably the most wear you'll get out of it.  I've found that you can extend the life by a couple more wears of you \"clean\" it with a small dollop of hand sanitizer gel.  I know that sounds weird, but the gel has enough slip to spread easily, but controllably, and it mitigates a little bit of the body oil that degrades the performance.\n\nI have the black lace version, and it's actually real lace, made out of netting, not just printed fabric, which is nice.\n\nI like the concept, but the sizing is misleading for western world women, and the materials could be a little better.  I think a metal popper would have been better than the plastic one used, and the foam could have been a little more flexible, which is why I only give this a 3 star rating.\n\n--Sale price accepted in exchange for a candid and objective review.--\n\n--------Update Jun 2016:------------\nCame back to upgrade my rating to 4 stars, based on the fact that the seller proactively reached out directly to try to understand each of my issues with the bra.  In the end, I had to trade up from the lace cup to the black solid bra with side wings.  The side wings go up higher and wider on the sides of your chest, so they lock things into place a little better.  The center clasp is an actual proper hinge clasp, so it takes away the fear of a popper coming undone.  The cups are also wider set, so the clasp sits closer to the top of the ribcage and doesn't create such an unnatural look.  This is a bra I'd feel comfortable wearing under a formal dress, rather than self-conscious.", "summary": "If you wear an A, B, or smallish C cup, just order the \"D\".", "unixReviewTime": 1462924800}

I love the lace detailing on it and I also love the cross back on it. It has adjustable shoulder straps to fit it properly. The length was perfect and the whole thing fit well. The only thing that didn't fit was the g-string. It was way too big and very high cut. I could pretty much pull the g-string up past my belly button which of course does not look attractive. I wish the g-string was a bit more low cut because it would have went well with the outfit so I have to wear a different pair of panties with it. I ordered this in purple and a size large and I'm 5'5, 36C, and 133lbs for reference. I could have went down to a medium though but it still fit comfortably and not too big. I've already washed it and it washed perfectly fine. I did use a lingerie bag though as I didn't want anything to happen to it. So far I'm happy with it. I love the vibrant purple color of the satin.

As a very flat-chested woman, that's a huge plus (and why I bought it to begin with).\nNo straps. No clasps. I can actually BUY a backless dress now or one of those cute 'cut-out' dresses!\nNot nearly as uncomfortable as I expected it to be.\nI have a feeling that peeling this off at the end of the day is going to be much more relieving than unclasping a bra at the end of the day.\nIt holds really well. I haven't been in an environment where I sweat a lot (others have said the adhesive doesn't hold when you sweat), but I've been carrying around boxes and stuff today and it's stayed fine.\n\nThe cons:\nI was kind of hoping for more 'upwards' support with this bra, but because you have to position your boobs to make sure the inside nipple covers do what they're supposed to do (otherwise ouch!), it's more of a 'together' support instead of 'up' support. Which works out fine! It just would have been nice to have some 'up' support.\nIt's a little bit itchy. It took some getting used to, and for the most part the itch went away after a little while. But occasionally I do feel a little itchy along the edges.\n\nFor the price, this is great just to have as a bra that you can wear with a backless/strapless dress.

The Cufflinks are made really nice and I've worn then a number of times. I wear them for work in a very nice blouse and I also wear these with casual shirts and a pair of jeans. I love that these cufflinks can be dressed up and down but no matter what, they look great and make the shirt look great as well. I love the color. The black, grey color goes well with all of my french cuff shirts so no matter what I wear, These cufflinks work with it. These cufflinks are easy to use. Just put in the cuff holes of the shirt and put the fasteners in place. The fasteners work very well and stay in place. The cufflinks have nice weight on them. They are not just cheap and light. I am happy with these cufflinks and will continue to wear them.\n\nI received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.

Which is great! I am size 12 or 14 in jeans (depending on brand, mostly a size 12 though)  and a size medium to large in shirts. I wear a bra size of 36C-D. I am 5'4 and currently 190lbs. I purchased this shirt in a size 12 and it fit very well for me. Just right! Very loose, but not baggy or boxy at all. Love this! Looks dressy, but I will attempt to make it casual. I think I could even go down a size if I wanted a more snug fit. I will wear it a whole day tomorrow and see if it loosens up a bit. If it does loosen up, than I will repurchase another top one size smaller. I have included pictures. I am curvy but small waisted and I felt this flattered my body type very well.\n\nI give it four stars for one reason: my only problem is the white lace that hangs loosely by the armpits. It looks a bit odd, especially when you are moving your arms up and down. But I can get past this because I love the shirt so much. Other than that the material feels very nice, not cheap like I was expecting. Hoping it holds up well once in the wash.\n\n*UPDATE* Very loose after wearing a day and the sleeves are long, I would get a size 10 next in another color. But it still looks good. Very simple to make casual with some jeans and cute booties ;-) I opted to wear a very popping matte lipstick with mine. ;-)\n\nIf anyone has tips on how they have dealt with the loosely hanging lace by the armpits please let me know.

When you did, they were at the rare men's suit shop and they were priced according to how 'rare' they seemed to be to find. Now, they are everywhere. Needless to say, it is a good time for those men who like to adorn their french cuff shirts with a little extra 'jewelry'. Cufflinks exude class, style, and not overly conspicuous.\n\nPossessing a good number of cuff links from all brands and all prices (no-name to luxury) I can tell you that roughly, they are all very similar. While the most expensive use real stones or a variation of a precious metal, you don't really need those. What you need is a none 'coloring' metal, good ends that won't bend, and a cuff link that won't lose its shine.\n\nThis pair has done that. Firstly, they are made of metal -- and are heavy to accompany this. They are solid and hard. The ends give some resistance when turning and that is a good thing. The end's 'weld' point is strong and I could not bend it when trying with most of my strength.\n\nThese are a normal size for cufflinks. The ends are subdued and subtle. They fit well with dress and casual attire.\n\nOverall, though, these are as good as will get sub-200$. If you don't care about stones or precious metals, then you could not really make a cuff link any better.", "summary": "Heavy Cuff Links With an Artistic Outlay", "unixReviewTime": 1453593600}

Most others a too short to cover the real problem areas, but this one extended from just under my breast area to my hips. I was also pretty impressed that it actually gave me a little bit of curves. I ordered my size according to the size chart and when it arrived I was able to get it hooked on the second set of hooks with no problem and comfortably. If you want to \"grow\" into this, I would suggest one size down. As you wear it, you are going to wear it in a bit and eventually be able to wear it at the smallest setting. It's a gradual process and you should start by wearing it for an hour or two per day and increase the length of wear as you go until you can get use to wearing it all day. It's supposed to be tight, but not so that you can't breathe or comfortably get through the day with it on.\n\nThe hooks seem a little on the cheap side. The reason I say that, is because as I was attempting to hook the trainer together, a few of the hooks bent fairly easily. I can bend them back, but too much of that is going to cause them to eventually wear and completely break off. This is the reason I gave it 4 stars. Otherwise, it's a great trainer!\nI was provided a sample with the request that I thoroughly test the product and give an honest review of it.

I was nervous about purchasing these headbands because I couldn't feel them but I am so glad I did! A headband that I will buy needs to be soft, not scratchy on her head, not too tight, and must not have any type of hard glue or anything else to hold it together that will leave a mark on her skin- especially because babies heads are so soft. These headbands are great! They are super soft fabric and fit very well, honestly these are probably the softest headbands I have seen. The material is a nice soft material and doesn't seem cheap, it seems like a good material that will hold up nicely and looks great! I love that there are so many different cute designs! We already have plenty of solid color headbands so the cute designs are a nice change up.  I am seriously so happy with this purchase!\n\nThe only flaw I've found is that these headbands say they go up to 3 years, but they fit my 7 month old wonderfully and don't seem to me like they will grow with her for that long.\n\nI received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

However, due to my undefined waist and larger chest (34DDD), it made me look eight months pregnant (empire waist silhouettes tend to do this if the fit is even the slightest bit snug) . Sure, I could put it on and tie it, and the length hit right where I wanted it to, but after a second opinion from my boyfriend, I couldn't keep it. This decision was not an easy one. Sure, the fit was a little off, but the blue-gray complimented my fair, cool-toned complexion, the sleeves weren't too long, and the jersey fabric felt breathable enough to be a perfect staple in my summer work wardrobe. The price-point was good for my wallet too (comparable cardigans tend to run $50 or more!). Quite disappointed, but not the end of the world.\n\nImmediately after dropping off my return at a UPS drop-box, I parked at a nearby fast-food restaurant, opened the Amazon app on my phone, and ordered the next size up (10/12). Two days later, I had my dream cardigan! Flawless fit. Figure flattering. Flowy, but not frumpy/oversized. Appropriate for the office or lounging around the house. And best of all, machine washable! I have washed it in my washing machine three times (with like colors, cold water, Tide liquid detergent, no fabric softener), laid flat to dry, and it is still as soft as the day I received it (not sure how it would hold up in the dryer but I'm not going to take any chances).

Con: It would require a new hem. Do I like it enough to spend $$ to have that done? (Not usually, but in this case, yes.) Would a new hem have the same light, fluttering look that the original does? (Some risk.) Pro: The 20 pearly pink buttons down the front are beautiful, and, by themselves, would cost about as much to buy as the cost of this dress. If all else fails, using these buttons to replace the simple white ones on my current favorite dress (also with a long button down front) would make it look even prettier ... and more expensive.

It is kind of a midnight blue, not the navy-black that it looks on my screen, but it is pretty and the style is cute. My only problem with it is it does run really small. I originally ordered my usual Large and could not even come close to buttoning the top (as a smock, the waist and hips were quite roomy). I had checked reviews for another similar dress from the same company and should have heeded the ones (multiple) that said it ran small and 'this is not made for girls with boobs'. I have those and, while they are not huge by any means, have run into that situation. However, it was also too narrow in the shoulders, which is very unusual for my pear-shaped body, meaning it was just generally too small.\n\nSo, I returned that one -- with no difficulty -- and ordered a 2X, which fits fine. It is obviously made on a different scale than standard US sizes. Just be aware of that when ordering, check the bust measurements in the size chart, and maybe go up an extra size if you are small-busted and have broad shoulders. Lastly, keep in mind that it is tunic length; the model pictured is probably not ridiculously tall.

I imagine that this one will be worn often enough. It isn't my favorite, but it is nice looking and the design will make a nice accent to several outfits.\nThis scarf is pretty nice, with fairly regular and straight hemming and not much puckering, which can be a problem with light weight fabrics.\nI got the animal print, and it says on the tag that it is 100% polyester. It does feel like a poly but with somewhat more body than most poly scarves.\nI plan to wash it by hand and hang it up to dry. I believe it could also be washed in a garment bag on the delicate cycle in the washing machine. Being polyester, it is very unlikely to fade, but I would err on the side of caution and wash it in cool water, with similar colors.\nThe colors of the scarf are browns and black, deep, dark colors.\nIt is a rectangular shape and long enough to be double wrapped if you like, or any of a dozen or more ways that you can find online or in books with scarf tying suggestions.\nI have tried it on with several tops and it looks best with ivory, browns, and black, but also orange, brick, and golden yellow.\nI like it.

I was excited to find this one because of the unique feature with the straps (backpack straps pull out to become shoulder bag). I've never seen this before and really like it!\n\nI received the bag yesterday and here are my first impressions. Overall, love the look of the bag! The description says leather, and in the reviews, I saw some people didn't think it was leather. If it's fake leather than it looks really good. It does not have that beautiful leather smell, but it also doesn't have the awful chemical smell that a lot of fake leather has. I actually think it is leather. I ran my fingernail along a spot on the bottom of the bag and it did not scratch.\n\nThe straps are great! I love the handle strap - makes it easy to hold the bag when you want to get something out of a pocket or to quickly pick up the bag. The backpack straps are easy to adjust for length, and it's easy to put the bag on and off. I don't really like the look of the bag as a shoulder bag because it looks so much like a backpack, but I like the option.\n\nThe pockets are a bit tighter than I was expecting, but it's probably due to the bag being so slender. The front pocket can hold only small items or very slender items. I have a tube of chapstick and lipstick in there. In the large zippered pocket, I can fit my A5 planner (which was the whole reason I wanted a backpack), slender (but full size) wallet, my iPhone, sunglasses case, small hairbrush, and small makeup bag. My iPhone did not fit in the smaller inside pocket which I assumed was for a cell phone, but it fit in the larger inside pocket. Everything fits in the main pocket but it is very tight! When I'm not going to work, I'll probably end up taking my planner out so there is more room in the main pocket. I have a toddler in diapers, and I could easily fit his changing pad with a small package of wipes and a few diapers in the bag if I took my planner out. I don't see myself using the back zippered pocket very much. The pocket is deep and wide, but the zipper opening isn't as big as the pocket so it's hard to get my hand in. A nice option for a small wallet while traveling, I guess.\n\nOverall, I love the look and functionality of the bag! I wish there was a little more room in the pockets, but I love the slender look of the bag and I wouldn't want to give up that look. I love being hands-free! I've been carrying a crossbody bag for years, but they tend to swing to the front when you bend over, which is really annoying. A backpack does not do that.", "summary": "Great backpack with lots of functionality! I recommend this bag!", "unixReviewTime": 1489449600}

As you can see in my short video, it is boldly striped but they are at an angle that lines up well with the sleeves when your arms are down.  The drawstrings on the hood are also intentionally off-centered.  It's a cool looking effect.\n\nThe sweatshirt itself is fairly thick and I like the fact that the sleeves are long enough to cover part of my hand as well.  Too many times I get tops that don't cover my arms all the way.\n\nI also like the coverage that the hood provides.  When on, it completely covers my head and then some.  Great for keeping warm!\n\nThe elastic bands on the sleeves and bottom help it to stay in place without being too tight.\n\nIt's important to mention that this is definitely a ladies cut sweatshirt.  It tapers in the middle.  I usually wear a size medium top but I like my sweatshirts big and bulky.  I ordered an XL and although it fits well, it isn't as large as I had expected.  You can see how it fits in the screenshots at the end of the video.  Just keep that in mind when deciding what size to purchase.\n\nThis sweatshirt provides great coverage and the pattern is definitely unique!.

I was one of 5 bridesmaids that ordered from  Milano Bride. We all ordered separately at different times. Although we all received our dress in a fairly timely manner some did take longer to arrive than others. After placing my order I received an email requesting my measurements and preference on a zip back or corset back. I sent in my measurements and asked for the corset back. One of the other girls did not send in her measurements and got her dress in standard sizing. My dress fit beautifully while the other bridesmaid needed some additional altering. Also since we all ordered separately there was some confusion where one of the dresses arrived with a zip back instead of corset. That particular bridesmaid contacted the company and they exchanged the dress with no major issue that I heard of. As for the quality of the dress I was highly impressed! I'll be honest we were leary about ordering our dresses online but working on a tight budget it was our best option. Don't be confused these ARE custom made dresses. The construction of the dress was very good. It even came with some extra  built in support which was nice. Since we had 5 different body types I was surprised that we all looked nice in the dress but we did. The color for all dresses were a good match as I know they were not all cut from the same bolt of fabric As for the fabric itself, it was of high quality. Not cheap feeling or costumey.

Otherwise, it won't cover your butt (unless you like it hanging out and showing LOL.) My daughter is 5' 9\" tall and this was not long enough to be a dress by any means.\n\nI ordered her an XL and she is a size 12-14 and it fit her for a beautiful sweater. It was not tight around her chest or arms and fit nicely. Ordered the white which is a very bright white. The listing makes the white (as listed) look cream, which it is not. The knit pattern is very pretty and well done. There were no flaws or loose stitches or anything like that. The knit and sweater is a thinner material so I would recommend also wearing a lighter top or a camisole under it. This is made very well. Overall, a very nice sweater \"dress\" that I would recommend for a sweater.\nI received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

It's extremely comfortable and light weight. I would definitely recommend wearing a tank top under it because it's pretty see-through, especially if you're busty. Because of how light weight it is I wouldn't recommend this for winter wear. Maybe if you have a jacket that pairs well and very thick jeans.

I normally wear an XL, as I like my shirts comfy but not hanging off of me.  Although it is incredibly comfortable, the material sucks to your body and is a bit small.  The XL states that it fits a US size 12-14, but it's more like a 10-12 -- so it's off by a size or so.  It's very lightweight and wouldn't keep you very warm in the really cold winter weather, but perfect for our Arizona winters.  It's actually quite thin, so you'll probably want to wear a t-shirt or tank top underneath it - because you can sort of see through it.  This is pretty stretchy and has a tiny bit of sheen when I took a picture with a flash, but when seen with your eye, it's a solid brown color with no sheen at all.  I do love the A-line flare at the bottom of it and you could totally dress this up or wear it with a pair of jeans!  There was a snag on the bottom front of my shirt and I'm afraid that if I snip it with a pair of scissors, it will start a horrible unraveling effect that would ruin it completely.  Washing this may be a bit tricky.  There isn't a tag inside mine that states what it's made of or how to wash/dry it - but my guess is that it would have to be hand washed.  It just seems too delicate to throw in with other clothes, but MIGHT work on a gentle washing cycle.  I've gotta say, it's a lot cuter on the model in the picture listing, probably because she's a tiny lady - but it gives me inspiration to lose more baby weight so it fits better.  Overall, it's ok - but doubt I'll wear it a ton just because it was sized wrong and I'm not particularly keen on hand washing clothing items.

The fit is usually spot on and the clothes wear very comfortably. This dress however I did not fall in love with.

I do prefer my dresses to be a bit more on the conservative side though. The only other complaint I have is that it's a little thin in the chest area so I need to wear or slip or under shirt underneath the dress. Although it is thin it still keeps you rather warm. Not hot, but also not cold. So it would be perfect on day/night that is cool. I have to admit that I got a lot of compliments when I wore dress, so the flaws are mainly a self preference or maybe a little insecurity.

For that, I'm grateful. I got the opportunity to review this item at fifty percent off the listed price on Amazon. So for me, that was about five or size dollars. Even with the half off price, I am so, so disappointed. The description says \"imitated wool\". Since I am unfamiliar with that texture, I guess imitated wool means \"similar to cardboard.\" This hat literally feels like it came from a costume shop. It was also folded in half when it came in. So there are creases and folds through out the hat that I can not manipulate back in to its original (or what I think the original) shape (should be). The ears are about the only thing that I like about the hat. There are adjustable strings on the inside of the hat, but that doesn't matter because the smaller you get the hat, I'm sure an infant would be able to use it. This hat, without the adjustments, fits a four year old. My four year old. If the hat didn't come in folded, especially because of the material it is made out of, and it actually fit my head. I wouldn't rate so harshly, but because it looks and feels like it came out of Party City, this hat did not work out for me. There was no product guarantee with the product itself when it was delivered to me, or in the product description, so please keep that in mind as well. If this is something you're definitely looking for, the quality isn't there, but the color is. The pigment is just as what is displayed in the photo description.\n\n-I WAS NOT PAID OR SPONSORED BY THE SELLER OR BY THE COMPANY FOR MY UNBIASED REVIEW. I STAND BY MY ASSESSMENT AND BELIEVE IT TO BE TRUE BY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT SAMPLE AT A REDUCED PRICE FOR MY UNBIASED REVIEW.

These polarized day/night glasses from Jaky have lenses that transition from gray tint at the top, to yellow at the bottom; giving you a great solution for sunset and late evening driving.\n\nWhen the sun is low on the horizon, the tinted portion of the lens does a good job of reducing glare, while the lower amber portion brightens objects on the road, and increases contrast.  Although this dual-purpose lens does take a little getting used to, they become second-nature (and a welcome benefit) in no time.  I have found that the day/night lens is best suited for dawn or dusk usage.\n\nThese stylish glasses are constructed well, and I haven't had any issues with loose lenses or screws, through months of usage.\n\nLike you, I base my purchase decisions on the experiences of others.

The hat is good quality and it is adjustable so it will work for a wide range of head sizes.

First of all I am disappointed in how the hat arrived; it arrived in a mailing envelope. I receive a lot of things from Amazon so when this package arrived I opened it up and was like what is this?? I had no idea it was a hat! I would assume that it would send it in a box or something similar so it would keep its shape. I am not quite sure if the hat will regain its shape. I bought the hat for my daughter so I think that my daughter will be happy with it and it does fit on my head but I think if someone had a bit bigger head that it would be a tight fit. So again, make sure you really want this hat because it looks very cute but it really is just like felt with very little structure in it. I really cant say may good things about it but it does look cute with the cat ears. I think my daughter will like it. It does not look like the picture at all because there all kinds of lines on the hat that you will probably never get out. I am very disappointed in. I have received a discount for my honest review.

It fits my small one well too, by the way. The spandex-type material stretches well. Not my style, but it looks fantastic on her.

Thinking of buying some more for stocking stuffers during the holiday season for my family of fishermen.\n\nThe stitching is good. It is very durable. I stretched it and tugged on it to test it out. Works very well. As I mentioned before, it is a sort of spandex material that is not to thick, but keeps you pretty warm as it fits tightly. I wore mine under my hood and it was fantastic. Could be used any time you want to keep the sun off of your head, neck, and face. I have used mine to mow the lawn before. My wife can wear it as a headband on runs. They wash easily.

The fabric seems like quality stuff and I can't get over how cute the floral pattern is, especially for this style of swimsuit. I do think that this suit runs slightly small, as I generally wear a 4-6, and according to the size chart that equates to a Medium, so that's what I ordered. However, the bottoms are slightly tight, which is alright because it helps to shape, but it is a little uncomfortable around the legs and the waist kind of popped when I first put it on. At least I don't have to worry about the bottoms coming off in the ocean waves! On the other hand, the cups in the top are a little large, or at least aren't great push-up cups, but it is really comfortable. I'm excited to use this swimsuit all summer.\nI purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review; I hope it helps with your purchase!", "summary": "I really like this swimsuit", "unixReviewTime": 1459382400}

It was a little difficult to pull up, as it has very little give to it. I have a longer torso for most one pieces and tend to buy suits specifically geared towards that. However, length wise, this fit fine. It did not pull, even after I tied it. The cups have a little more padding at the base to help push you up and they are a little thicker than some suits. The bottom up the suit is sewn to the back, or it is one piece in the back. However, in the front the bottom is attached to the liner, and not at the edge of them. Which I thought a little unusual compared to other one's made similarly. It was a little snug at my tummy, which made the front of the suit ride up and you could see the white of the liner, because the bottoms are bikini like in the front. I'm 5'3\" if that makes a difference. My husband liked the suit on me. My sister and I did not like the white liner showing. That would make me uncomfortable to keep pulling down the top.

Usually suits with such a quality bra included are Super expensive! So for me, that's just an extra bonus. The straps aren't quite as flattering on me, they are in the middle of the cup rather than the side as I expected - but this is where the slight smallness of the suit really shows on me so I imagine once I get back down to my regular summer size, this won't be a problem at all.

I am not complaining, I don't mind the extra help! It does have under wire in it and quite a bit of padding in it. The material is very soft and comfortable to wear.

It has a underlying fabric, so no stomach is exposed. It is in the ruching, so it just adds to it. It flatters and hides any extra tummy bulge you might not want to be showing.\nIt fit great! The sizes are not your typical sizes. I normally wear a size 14 and ordered a 4x. It fits like an XL.

I really liked that aspect of the packaging because reuse the bag when I go destination swimming. This allows me to change and not worry about getting the car wet, or where to put the suit once I take it off.\n\nThe swim suit is beautiful. The colors are vibrant.  Although it's a one piece, the front has two layers. The bottom layer is a nude color and is attached to what would be considered a bottom on a two piece suit. The top layer comes down far enouth that the second lay won't show. I really like this aspect in in bathing suit because it acts a little like a gerdal (Helps suck in the the tummy a little, and helps give shape). The top part (or bra like area) comes with two lays of cushion. One helps keep the bra like shape and the other seems like it's meant to help act like a push up. Not the best fit if you have a bigger chest/breast.\n\nSize wise, it's true to the number. I ordered a 14-16 and it fit like I expected it to fit.\n\nAll in all it's beautiful, it's supportive, and the package is reusable.\n\nDisclaimer: This review is my honest option and view on this product.

I was very excited to try it when I got it. The material is very nice and moves well. The cut is super cute and definitely reminds me of the '50s style bathing suits with a new age addition. However, I was slightly disappointed by a couple things. As I was putting it on it was slightly snug going over my hips (I thought it might tear, but luckily it didn't). After getting it on and tying it up I realized that not only was there underwire, there is also padding in the cups. I had chosen this bathing suit because there was no mention at all whether there was wire or padding. This is a bit of a problem for a girl with a slightly larger than average chest. I am able to make it work by some adjusting, but it's not as comfortable as any other suit where I have the option of no padding.\nThe single strap behind the neck does hold well with a good snug tie done up. I noticed after having it one that the top part is actually partially disconnected from the bottom piece. I'm guessing this is for a better feel of the bathing suit. There is still netting under that piece, but it's nice how it moves.

Kind of what I remember like the 50s swimsuits used to look like.  It fits comfortably in the rest of the body. Not too tight on the butt, stomach or over the neck. It is relaxed fitting in the stomach which makes it comfortable to wear and not embarrassing as I do get very self-conscious in a bathing suit. There is this underneath layer that is on the suite as well which is also why it is relaxed in the stomach because there is a slit that allows it to be two connected pieces.

I purchased a 3xl and the bottoms were a great fit.  My problem came with the top.  The top is not made for a DD cup size.  No matter how I tried to position it I was either spilling out the sides or popping out of the front.  The padding was ample, which is nice, I just wish there was more fabric around it.  The workmanship was good quality...no crazy or loose stitching anywhere that I could see.

It felt great and was very flattering. I love halter neck lines because it makes shoulders and my whole top half look more slender. But sometimes the straps cut into my shoulders from the weight. Not so with this because of the actual bra support built into the suit. I could undo the straps to nurse my baby and the cups would not fall down because of the fitted underwire bra!!!

If I hadve been with a crowd of one piece swimsuit friends or ladies much less curvy than me I might've felt uncomfortable with such accentuated boobies. But I was with family and all the ladies were slender and were wearing bikinis and I felt like my busty tankini was great for my mom-body but still looked cute and not old and boring. :)\n\nOverall the fit is great and very secure. It hides tummy fluff and makes the girls look great. I also like how it comes down lower than I expected and almost gave a slight skirt/A-line look to distract from my untoned chubby upper thighs in the crotch area, but the back was still short enough to show a bit of my butt so you could tell it wasn't a swim dress or one piece.\n\nI got the matching bottoms which I also love!

I did not want to take the chance as most non- gold or silver turns me green.\nI did not expect these to last more than a summer or two from the get go.\nThese are just a fun one or two season purchase to complete a look.

It fit relatively well which I admit was unexpected. This is because i am 5'1 and about 108lbs so my torso is fairly small. However the small fit very well. It wasn't too tight or too large.  I also really appreciated the material. I have purchased button up shirts before that have horrible stitching and quality to them. This was not the case with this shirt. i am pleased to say that the material was really good quality and not too thick or thin for a plain shirt.\n\nIt was a pretty soft cotton feel which I  did not expect but I am very pleased to have. It does seem like the type of top that will shrink a tad after washing and drying it so just keep an eye out for this, because I know i will. I honestly had no drawbacks about this purchase. It also came in a very nice package with a zip like top so i assume this could be reused technically. I love when the packaging to times has its own style, It lets me know the product has the potential to be good quality.\n\nI have a lot of plaid shirts in my closet from different stores like old navy, target, and Jcpenny. I will say that the quality of this shirt definitely aligned with theses stores if not better because of how it was packaged. The only thing i will add is that initially I was afraid they sent the wrong size because the size in the collar had an \"L\" on it, but it definitely fit like a small given I am a fairly small person. I like to think i am a pretty picky shopper as well since i have a small torso but large bust size. It is always hard to wear clothes that accommodate me. Usually a top is too long or too tight around my chest. This top fits the bill perfectly though which makes me really happy!

This fit me even though I have glasses on. Which made me happy. It fit my 4 year old pretty good and it fit me pretty good. I also really like the color of the mask and the detail of the math. The headband has little lines and markings which makes it very detailed also the chin is indented and the cheek bones are indented. It was also easy to breathe through which I was surprised because it looks like there aren't many holes. The rubber band around the head fit me pretty well and was comfortable.

I would have given 5 stars if the over-the-shoulder strap wasn't so long.  Even on the smallest adjustment, the purse hangs to mid thigh on me, making it uncomfortable to walk.

Here I am reviewing UNDERWEAR.  Yup, underwear.  But if you're reading this right now you know that the struggle is real when it comes to having a nicely shaped perky booty.  I've been working out like crazy but my butt just hasn't quite responded to my endless squats and lunges, at least, not as fast as I've hoped!  Enter butt lift underwear stage right.  I'm not going to lie, I've been researching special underwear to help out my backside for quite a while.  I was between these and the padded kind but those sort of look dated and really unappealing.  I'm testing the waters on these first!  I did do what they suggested and ordered a size up, based on other reviewers experiences.  Good thing, because my normal size would've cut all all circulation to anything under my butt.  I'm usually a small or extra small and I got a medium.  So yes, definitely go up a size so you've got the proper fit.  Heck, maybe even two sizes!  I've seen some reviewers say these are sexy.  I'm gonna say no on that one, though my husband does think these are funny, entertaining even.  But sexy? Nope.  Not my thing!  They're black and sheer so they aren't unfortunate looking, just not like your traditional sexy lingerie. But whatever, these are for FUNCTION, not looks, at least in my book.  Onto the pros and cons!\n\nHere's the good: They DO work.  They lift your booty, yeahh!  They're surprisingly comfortable - I was definitely shocked on that one. They're black and I simply like black underwear.  (I think they have nude as well, by they way)  They arrived a day earlier than expected, so that was an added bonus!!!\n\nHere's the not so good: They run small, though as long as you size up this isn't really a drawback.  They aren't seamless, at least on me, so you can see the line under certain types of clothing: mainly leggings.  This is a big drawback for me because I'm practically the president of the \"Leggings are Pants\" movement.  I don't want people to look at my butt and see the big circles or a muffin top or my thighs bulging out from the bottom.\n\nThese undies do look good, however, underneath regular old jeans, and even under dresses provided that they aren't super thin or made of that awful thin jersey material that shows EVERYTHING. (That material should be banned, by the way.)\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend these butt lift underwear because they do what they claim and that's what I was hoping for.  The price is fair, which makes them even more of a power buy.  Quick disclaimer: I was offered a discount to try these out and provide a HONEST unbiased review, so here I am. :)  Four out of my stars in my book.  These are a good buy and worth the money.

I really enjoy wearing earrings and its hard to find earrings that work for everyday use but these are perfect.  Theyre lightweight and absolutely beautiful.\n\nDont get me wrong, these would work great for special occasions too but they work great for me for everyday wear.  Theyre absolutely beautiful but I feel like some earrings are just a little too much for everyday wear and these are perfect.  As you can see they are no larger than the size of the dime but what they lack in size they make up for in sparkle and shine. Theres one large stone and then its studded with tiny stones all around the large stone.  They really are very pretty.\n\nThe presentation of these are also fantastic.  They came in a super cute jewelry box and inside the box are the earrings AND the cutest little pink velvet pouch to store your earrings in.  They also have a little cleaning cloth too.  This is a really nice set of earrings and they're one of my favorite day to day earrings!\n\nI received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.", "summary": "Beautiful, lightweight earrings I can wear everyday.", "unixReviewTime": 1464480000}

I used a steam iron and most wrinkles disappeared, but the fabric wrinkles very easily.  Ironing it wasn't easy. Also, the tie does not tie at a natural waist line, more like six inches above and it is a thin piece of fabric. I normally wear a regular size 16, but based on size chart ordered a 16 W or XXXLG. The fit is good. I am posting three pictures for others. Picture (1) right out of the bag; (2) after being washed/dried; and (3) after ironing.

It looks more like a rainbow on your wrist in person - not what I was going for.  The stitching was crooked, the holes were unevenly sized and crooked.  Got a different model band from Clockwork Synergy and it was even worse. That one was too wide and the material didn't compress at all, so it would be extremely difficult to remove once it was on your watch.  The inner edges of the band where it is burned to seal the edges has sharp corners and had to be nipped off with scissors, even then it was *itchy and scratchy* against the skin.  Couldn't just drop it off at the UPS store with my other returns either since UPS is a ripoff for small, low value items.  Had to go to the USPS which is only open when I'm at work, and I work 7 days a week and pay for my own return shipping.  All in all, it was two bad experiences out of two purchases and a hassle.  The straps I would rate 2-3 stars but the overall buying experience is 1 star. Would not recommend or buy from again.\n\nMy suggestion is to get a nato strap from Zuludiver / Geckota.

I love that much, for sure! I was disappointed that it is so small. I wear a large and ordered XLarge to make sure it would flow nicely; however, it was still too small. It was just too snug across the bustline and arms. Too snug to wear in public anyway! I'm losing weight, so I'm going to hang on to it a little longer before I pass it along to a smaller person. Aside from the fit, I love the dress. Since it is plain, it leaves lots of room to dress it up or down with jewelry, jackets, or scarves. I might try to pull it off with a jacket. It is comfy enough and the jacket would hide the tightness in the bust and arms. I would recommend this dress....but in a larger size than what you normally wear.....two sizes up is what I would select next time around. If the dress fit as the given size or one size up, it would get 5 stars.... I double checked the post and sizing chart. If they had given more accurate sizing instructions, I would give them 5 stars... The sizing chart says to order XL for 16-18 US sizes. There is no way this would fit a 16 to 18....I was a 16 and am now a 12, so I know how 16s fit.

This dress accentuates ALL of your features. Whether that be your muffin top, love handles, fat sticking from the panty line. EVERYTHING! But that IS polyester for you. Too bad the black color isn't available in an XXL at the moment. I ordered this on sale. It was like $4. It doesn't go too well with my skin, It's almost close to a neon color in person. The picture I provided did no justice. There was also threads sticking out of both sleeves. Like they kept sewing and didn't stop at the end of the fabric. They passed it completely for about 4 inches. I guess that's why it was on sale. Overall, it is true to size and is quite long, which I like. I don't find Maxi dresses appealing if they show your feet. What's the point of wearing a Maxi if it did? I am also 5'3 so it could be because I'm a little under the average side of \"short\".

The picture is not deceiving at all.\n\nI am currently in the middle of a weight loss journey. When you've lost 75 pounds and have 45 more to go, you need to find clothes that fit. However you can't afford a new wardrobe now and again in 45 pounds. This dress was a perfect addition.\n\nThe fit of the dress was what I expected. Chinese manufactured items like this tend to run small, so I always order a size up. I'm currently wearing an xl in most clothes, so I got a 2xl in this.\n\nThe material reminds me of a dry fit spandex type feel. It is very stretchable, but extra lightweight. I love that it is quarter sleeve as well. I like to hide my bat wings, and this dress does that nicely.\n\nThe length of the dress is also perfect. I'm 5'7 and it falls right at my ankle. I wouldn't want it any shorter or longer.\n\nMy one complaint about this dress is that the material does not hide any imperfections. As you can see in the photo, it definitely shows the bra bulge. You don't even want to see my back fat. I think with an appropriate sweater though it will be fine, since it isn't tight in the stomach or below. If possible, I'll order an extra size up next time.\n\nOverall, I can't complain about a dress that I only paid $4 for.\nIf you need a cheap maxi dress for daily use, I definitely recommend grab if this one.", "summary": "Doesn't hide back fat, but is still a good dress for daily wear!", "unixReviewTime": 1455494400}

They apply a hard glue to the stitches and the ends where it touches your wrist, and on one side it scratched me to where I looked like I had been mauled by a cat. I bled for this watch band.

It includes red, light blue, yellow gold, purple, gray, navy blue, and two styles in black. The purple and gold colors are the his school color so my friend was really happy those were included. He actually wore the gold one on his first day of school. It was a real hit because who doesn't love a sharp dressed kindergartner?  They all have subtle white polka dots except for the navy, red and one of the blacks which have polka dots that are the same color as the bow tie.  They bow ties are pre-tied and made of a nice quality polyester.  The neck band is adjustable on them and the clip is easy to open and close.  He can even do it himself.

The crest on top also curls over and I don't know if I could honestly make it stand up. I am going to try ironing it with a towel over top to see if I can give it some lift.\n\nBottom Line: For the price, you can't beat it. I don't think you could get the yarn for that cheap..

I've always been more comfortable wearing pendant style necklaces, and this one was a little bit grand. It is a beautiful necklace, but unfortunately I don't have much in my closet that I can quite make this work with. The yellows and ambers, maroons and reds are very earthy, almost autumn colors. They don't lend to a spring or summer wardrobe very effectively. The necklace length is about right, but a little long. In the picture you can see one of the strands that hangs a little lower, and that is precisely what I received. I've actually adjusted that strand to not droop, which, I imagine, is probably going to ruin the look of it, but it makes me feel better. The gold necklace is more antique brassy than a true gold. I believe the whole necklace was designed to have a retro look to it, and it achieves a quite nicely. The beads are nicely designed, and the variety is well-balanced. Like I said, this is a necklace more designed for a fall winter wardrobe and for somebody who doesn't mind making a bit of a statement.

But I had expected a flowy, relaxed construction, deep v, 3/4 sleeve skater mini dress... The dress I received was made of a very stiff fabric in top, then several layers of tulle underneath (think tutu or petticoat  material) which made the skirt very puffy and stay in place when moving around/feel very structured.  The sleeves came just above my elbow, and the v was just mid- chest/a couple inches past the collarbone- nowhere near the picture where it extends passed the bra line, and came down to just above my knees (I'm 5'7\"). To be clear, the dress wasn't ugly, but it wasn't what I wanted. I possibly could have made it work for what it was, but unfortunately the fabric was so stiff, it wasn't just uncomfortable, it was painful to have on while trying it on, there was no way I would have survived a day wearing it.

We always order at least a size bigger than he would need for his weight because of his height, especially because he is tall through his torso. So in this we got him a XXL. The length was good for him and it fit similar to other shirts we have that are the same size (it is hard to find tall T-shirts!)\n\nThe quality of this T-shirt is very nice. The fabric is very soft. The fabric is thinner- which we love because we live in South Florida and heavy T-shirts are reserved for winter (ha ha). It is light enough that he has worn it to ride his mountain bike. Speaking of, it washes up very nice. I do not dry his T-shirts so I can not say how well it dries. But it has become one of his favorite shirts and I have wasted it at least 10 times and it is still holding up great.\n\nThe graphics on this are printed on very well and have also held up to multiple washings. This shirt is especially perfect because we eat a diet very similar to paleo.. which is often called the caveman diet. He wore this to a biking club get together and received several compliments on it- there were even a few people that suggested he ride with a loin cloth...I hope that was a joke!

Smith", "reviewText": "Purpose:  Senior Prom, Spring 2017 -- ordering early for senior pictures.\n\nOverall:  Material, quality and craftsmanship are excellent and on par with boutique dresses we have tried in the $300-$500 range.  The beading is delicate, sophisticated, and beautiful -- photos do not do it justice.  Absolutely gorgeous dress overall.\n\nAlterations Needed:  Extra midriff liner, trim train.\n\nShipping:  Fast, but not accurate -- we ordered burgundy but received red.  Returning and reordering.\n\nSizing:  Like many other posters recommend:  when in doubt, size up!  We measured carefully and used the size guide as instructed and although the dress fit, it is quite tight in the arms and across the neckline.  She could wear it, but it would probably not be comfortable by the end of the night.  Since we have to return to get the correct color, we are going to size up.\n\nModesty/Appropriateness:  The fit is lovely and elegant.  The built-in bra is supportive and the mermaid fit through the torso and hips is feminine but not body-con.  The overall look is age-appropriate -- grown-up but not \"old\".  The skirt is fully lined.  The top is somewhat sheer on the midriff and back.  There are a few small areas in the midriff detail design where there is sheer fabric against skin that in some lights can appear slightly see-through.  Our dress code is particularly conservative; to be on the safe side, we would have a seamstress insert a second liner in that part of the bodice.\n\nColor:  We ordered burgundy but unfortunately, were shipped the red.  The red is actually quite lovely, a cross between crimson and cherry, but it's not what we wanted so we are going to reorder and hopefully will get the right color this time.\n\nLength/Weight:  We measured carefully as instructed -- hollow of the throat to the floor with heels -- and the length is exactly what the website said it would be.  However, the train is VERY long and VERY heavy.  My daughter really wants a lot of train this year but even she thinks this is too much and so the other alteration we'll need to make is to trim the train.", "summary": "quality and craftsmanship are excellent and on par with boutique dresses we have tried ...", "unixReviewTime": 1473120000}

My daughter fell in love with a dress at a boutique, but I didn't love the price, it was $245.  So, I suggested that she get on Amazon and try to find a similar dress to that one of the boutique.  Well, she chose this one, in royal blue.  The color of the dress is beautiful and the beading is exquisite.  Her usual dress size is 7 , but I didn't want to order the size 8, for fear of it being to big.  Well the size 6 fit her like a glove.  The material is somewhat stretchy, so that helps give the mermaid illusion as it hugs every curve.  She is really going to enjoy wearing this dress for her prom.  Also the seller was really helpful.  I needed this dress in less than two weeks and I messaged the seller as soon as I ordered it and they responded very quickly.  The seller said they hand make the dresses as they are ordered, so the dress wasn't even made yet.  The seller said they would put a rush on it and try their hardest to get it done quickly so they could ship and it get here on time.  It was delivered yesterday by DHL.

It also has an exterior pocket that I don't see on the ad, I did not consider this a negative  just unexpected.\nThe wallet that arrived area wise is slightly bigger than my worn-out old eel skin wallet but is thinner.\nThis wallet (bill-fold) also seems like it doesnt open as youd think it would. Though it's working smoother/wider as the leather gets worked.\nSo when I received this wallet I was disappointed as it wasn't what I thought it would be.  I considered sending it back for not being what was depicted. However, after sleeping on it, I figured Id try it out and moved my contents from my old wallet to this one.  It is thinner and that felt better, everything from the old one did fit  so functionality was achieved and I became more satisfied.  The aesthetic appeal from the ad was meant and the construction/workmanship is worthy/durable looking  a big appeal to me.\nIve been using it now a few days, and I like it.

It's very utilitarian/rugged.\n\nI did have a small issue with the window on the inside of the wallet coming unglued and my card corner poked out the side. I remedied this temporarily by lifting the flap and re-tucking the window under the flap. I will need to use some super glue and apply with a needle point and that should fix it back. I considered sending it back but I just like it too much to send it back so I will make due.\n\nThe description is a bit off but there are 6 slots for credit cards, 2 windows (front/back), two inside slots (either side), double bill separator plus a zippered bill compartment, and there is also an exterior slot at the spine. Very nice set up.

Honest what girl doesn't need a heart necklace? I know it is one of my go to shapes, and this is is no acceptation. I love wearing this on different occasions , mostly more \"formal\" ones that I do not want my necklace to stick out since it is rather subtle which I enjoy. It is so pretty, and truly goes with any outfit that you would wear. It is sterling sliver which I love,since I won't break out or get a green neck from wearing it to much even if it isn't gold. The chain is honestly the perfect length for me, so no complaints at all. I also want to talk about the packaging, which is so fantastic! it comes in a square black box, then inside of that box is a triangle shaped black glittery box. Then the necklace is  is plastic, the heart piece separated from the necklace so it doesn't get tangled. overall I truly love this necklace and it is so pretty and defiantly a part of my almost everyday jewelry wear.\n- I did receive this product for free in return for my honest and unbiased opinion.

It took me a minute or two to figure it out. You'll probably end up referring to the seller's picture for referencing :-) The bottom is high waisted. The style is definitely aligned with this year. In terms of the fit, the top is long enough to cover your beauties to an extent. You'll notice in my pictures that there is a small area that shows. This is a call out for those that are more body conscious, but then again, this is a sexy swimsuit. The bottom was a bit on the smaller side for me. Didn't have enough stretch to it where I felt comfortable or where I felt that I could get away with wearing without someone else calling it out. This is evident in my pictures. Again, I have to stress that I am a curvaceous woman.

All three were made differently, which doesn't reflect it in the images.\nFirst off, the white - the bottoms were seriously just granny panties. The garters in the waistband and the legholes were too tight, but the material ballooned on me. And it fell about an inch below my belly button. The white top was the only one of the three that was double layered.\nNow, for the black suit - I think out of the three this was the one I liked best. The bottom had an almost seamless look once you had it on. This had the best fit without being too loose and it covered up to my belly button. Unfortunately, the top was just a long price of cloth that was cut out. They didn't even bother sewing in seams on it. The length though was long enough that you could have played around with it in order to find different ways to tie it.\nAnnnd the red - the material for this had a shine to it and it was very stretchy. The bottom reach all the way under my breast. After putting that on I didn't even bother messing with the top. The top's seams were sewn too tight that it looked like it was ruffled. It was also shorter in length than the other two tops.\nAs much as I loved the look of it in the images, it just didn't work out for me.

When I put them on, I don't have to worry about it slipping or coming loose.  The bar might become slightly askew from time to time, but I don't think that's avoidable.  Also, they look nice, even though they aren't very expensive. Lastly, the back of the tie bar is very wide so that it can fully cover the tie and stay in place.\n\nTHE BAD\nThe designs are very basic and they aren't all that great, but for the price, I'm not very upset about it.\n\nTHE DOES-THIS-THING-EVEN-WORK\nYes, they do work well.  They are entry level, but they will still turn heads and get you a thumbs up for passing masses.\n\n*Disclaimer: I received this product at a reduced rate for my unbiased opinion.

I was also very nervous to spend money on this, seeing that it had not been previously reviewed by any other customers. When it arrived, I was so excited about how the material felt, and opened each compartment and just marveled a bit. I sat down and wrote a quick email to the company letting them know that I was already happy with my purchase, and asked a few questions, but never received an email back, which I was slightly disappointed about. I hope when they get the chance, that they can answer me back.\n\nI finally had the opportunity to use this, not on a hike, but on a trip to Seaside, Oregon that I just took this last weekend, so I got to wear it while I walked the beach, and went geocaching with friends. It is very comfortable! I was able to fit my 2L Hydration Bladder in the elastic flat inner pocket inside of the main zipper area. There is a top zipper compartment which also has a smaller netted zipped area inside. A vertical zipped pocket in the front center. There are two adjustable elastic hooks on either side of this pocket which allows you to pack rolled up items outside of the backpack. I actually love that part the most. There are two yellow loops at the front base of the backpack (as you can see in the ad here). I have seen these on other hiking backpacks before, but have only ever seen elastic bands. These are just a regular material and have no stretch. I suppose I could use the loops for any tie downs or carrying rope, etc. That was actually my question to the seller, asking them what they intended for those loops.\n\nFinally, there are two water bottle/beverage pockets on the side. (Yes you can see one of the wine bottles I carried around with my girlfriends on our trip). They are elastic edged, with netting, and then have two buckle clips right above to assist in holding the water bottle (or wine bottle) into place while moving around. I love this feature as well.\n\nThe part of the bag that rests upon your back, is pretty thick foam padded, with a soft nylon/spandex type gray material. Very cool to the touch and soft. The entire backpack is lightweight and comfortable on my shoulders. There is a chest buckle connected to the two straps, for extra support. If I could make an improvement to this, I would have liked to see a lower back padded support, that can be buckled around the waist. Adding that would make this perfect!\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this for anyone wanting a good hiking backpack. This may not be considered the best quality for people who spend most of their time hiking and backpacking, but if you're like me, and only hike with a backpack a handful of times per year, then I'd definitely recommend this one.\n\nI purchased this at a promotional price to test it out and then share my thoughts, experiences and suggestions for improvement. My opinion, rating and stated experience is in no way affected or influenced by the promotional price.", "summary": "Perfect for what I need! Photos here!", "unixReviewTime": 1468368000}

I am not sure I would call the color brown but maybe dark purple. Either way it looks beautiful when combined with the yellow zippers. The three main bags are perfectly sized.\n\nThe main compartment has a divider in the lower half that would easily take any odds and ends that need to be kinda organized.\n\nThe top compartment has a nice mesh interior pocket to hold small items like earplugs or chapstick that might otherwise fall out.\n\nThe front compartment runs about half the length of the bag and is great for storage of any items like a jacket you might need access to quickly.\n\nI can't say enough good things about this backpack. I was expecting a much lower quality than the backpack I had from Lowe Alpine aND have been using for a decade. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this bag might last that long.\n\nThank you for taking the time to watch my video or read my review. If you found it helpful, please click the This was Helpful Button. To be 100% fair, I received this product at a free or reduced price in exchange for a fair and honest review. If I find that a product does not meet my minimum expectations for what it was designed to do, For Example a medical Kit that does not have the proper equipment to do what it says it can yet at least has some value, it is generally a 2-3 Star. As far as the review, if for example its a phone case that won't really protect your phone, you will hear about it here first. I like to show all the pros and cons in my videos of a product. If something does what it is supposed to do, its worth 4 stars in my opinion. If its an Excellent Product, then I like to reward the company with a 5 Star rating. If a product utterly fails while I am testing it, it receives a 1 star.", "summary": "Perfect for day hikes and every day use", "unixReviewTime": 1468195200}

It also has two side pockets which is perfect for water bottles. It also has a top compartment that has a zipper compartment inside of it which is perfect for me I'm a nurse and like to keep my nursing supplies separate from the rest of the bag.\nThe back straps are padded as well as the back plate area- it's also not solid to allow for ventilation. It has two it has two elastic bungee cords toward the top to attach key or whatever.\nI have no negative comments about this bag at all- so far I think it's perfect for me.", "summary": "Great bag- I'm impressed- a LOT of room", "unixReviewTime": 1468022400}

My husband is in the military and as this is a military shirt I figure I couldn't go wrong. I also love the variety of colors to choose from each with its own unique design. I received the shirt in the mail and at first look my husband loved it. The problem we found was  this shirt fits small. My husband normally wears a size large. I was not sure of how this shirt was going to fit so I bought x large just incase. He was not able to button past the third button from the bottom up. If you are skinny this shirt is for you, however, if you are muscular(gym stud) buy a size or two up, depending on your bulk. He is not able to wear this shirt but that does not take away the fact that this short is beautiful. The material is made from good quality and will last for quite a while.

It hardly covers the nipples! Way too low. I plan to detach it from the garment and sew the straps shorter to hold \"the girls\" in. I have DD girls so they're not particularly \"high\" breasts.\n2) The dress fits very small, which I knew in reading other comments. I truly recommend going 2-4 sized up. In the photo of the model, it fits loosely as a shift dress and hangs in the back. As a true size 10 I'd need a 14 to accomplish a similar look.\n3) It is far from white! It's a vintage cream (in my opinion). See photos for comparison on my true white bedsheets\nIt's very cute. The price is low and I like the look so I won't be returning it.

Most \"vintage style\" items usually run slightly smaller than the sizing states, but luckily for me, that wasn't the case at all with this dress!\n\nI opened the package and tried on the XXL and was happy to see that, although it was slightly snug in the chest area (but NOT uncomfortable/unwearable), it FIT! - And it was GORGEOUS on!  I received the dress in the Royal Blue, but I'm sure it is gorgeous in either color - the Royal Blue is a very dark blue...almost to the point of being black.  The dress is also comfortable, which is a nice plus...I can't wait for an event to provide an opportunity for me to show off this dress!  I was also impressed that the dress came with a camisole to wear under the lace - the camisole was also comfortable and fit great...what a nice added bonus!\n\nOverall, I was definitely impressed and would love the opportunity to try more from this company in the future.

This was not like that at all.\n\nSUPER flattering for a curvy figure. This fits like a glove and I feel like a magazine model on Better Homes circa 1950.\n\nThe dress is very well put together. The stitch work is beyond impressive. The buttons are tight but not too tight. The collar is elegant and easy to work with.\n\nI love the midsection; the gold buckle accent really helps give the illusion of a smaller waist though I do wish this part came with a belt or some kind of stretch belt just to add more to the illusion but this is impressive.\n\nThe skirt is beautiful. Big and full and there's pleating around the whole skirt. Made of thick fabric so could easily be worn in cooler weather.\n\nAn undershirt comes with this that's the tank top you see which actually is a lot longer than just a shirt. Could work as a short slip.\n\nYou have the option to button the whole thing or some or none and it still looks classy and tasteful.\n\nThe sleeves don't go down all the way, I love that. Has thick cuffs which you can leave down or fold up.\n\nIt's not a short dress by any means. I'm 5' 3\" and this goes just past my knees. Would look super cute with a kitten heel.\n\nThis could be used for a fall/winter occasion or even for Halloween. Would also make a great theater costume so you've got options as to where/what this can be worn for.\n\nThe lace isn't rough at all. It's very soft and not totally see through either.\n\nThere's a small zipper in the back almost unnoticeable.\n\nI'd recommend machine washing in cold water the first time and air drying it.\n\nI definitely probably could've ordered my regular size instead of one size up. It's pretty stretchy except for the middle part.\n\nOffers a lovely feminine silhouette. It's much nicer than I expected in quality and fabric.
