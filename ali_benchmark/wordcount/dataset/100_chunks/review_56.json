I thought that by the picture that his fingers would be all narley but he has dimension and he just looks awesome. One thing that I can say is that Jen here in the other review has a point, it looks like his right arm could snap off pretty easily, and the ring from the chain to the charm could be a little better quality, but the chain itself is hot as hell, but you better be a tall or fat mo fo, cause 36in is long!

I think that's why the model is wearing boots in the picture instead of sneakers or anything else shorter. Plus, I wear leggings all the time. I have purchased cotton leggings, printed leggings, fleece leggings, all different kinds... and I always fit in a large. Straight across the board, I have a size large lower body. I ordered these in large and you would've thought I ordered a small. I couldn't even get them up onto my calves.

Suffice to say, this was by far her favorite gift this year - score one for dad's awesome gf!\n\nFirst, the material... as other reviewers have said, I was really impressed with the quality of the material. It is VERY thick and plush - definitely pj's for fall and winter months (in the summer only if you've got the AC running), and I could certainly see wearing this out for trick or treating as a costume and being totally warm and cozy inside. I cannot overstate just how good the quality of this material is. I really was expecting something thin, more like flannel pajama pant thickness (especially since I got it for such a low price - $24.99), but this measured almost a full inch thick, and is super soft!\n\nSizing. I know this is a hard thing to figure out when ordering online, so I wanted to include mine to hopefully help some people ordering in the future. This item is made to be worn baggy, so with the hood you really want to make sure you order one that will fit height. The girl this went to is 5'0 and 102lbs, thin build, and I ordered an adult Small. It fit great, and left her with a little room to grow. Her jean size is a girl's 12, and her shirt size is a girl's L.  I also tried on the unicorn before I wrapped it, just so I could add the extra info of how it fit me into my review... I'm 5'2 1/2, 125lbs, wear a size 6 jean, and have a 32FF chest - the small fit me great as well. As you can tell I've got a very \"hourglass\" shaped figure, but the fit was still very loose on me. I'd say anyone my height to to probably about 150lbs would likely be just fine with a Small. I think if you are over 5'3, though, then you should definitely look at purchasing the Medium, regardless of weight.

I'm wondering if this is a joke or something. They describe them as 84cm.. Well, I just got out my handy dandy tape measure and while they are laying flat, they measure almost 60cm..

I contacted the seller but I doubt I will hear back. I will definitely definitely be filing a complaint with Amazon. I don't even know what to do with these, it's not that they don't fit, it's that they are made in the most ridiculous way possible. They would not fit anybody. This company obviously has no quality control whatsoever. don't waste your money.\n\nUpdate.. I really tried quite hard to figure these out bc they came in a legit thigh high package (in Chinese but it's clear that's what they were meant to be). So idk if they just add the box to make them seem legit ? Anyway, if I pulled them tight enough to nearly rip them, I could get it slightly over my knee (I'm 5'4) but the lace top is still enormous and would require quite a sturdy, LONG, garter belt, maybe. The diameter is still huge compared to how small the tights are so they can't possible fit any body shape. Bottom line ... Don't order, lol, wow..

This could be a turn off in meetings if other people can smell it.\n\nThe second hesitation I have is that the rigidity of the pad comes from some cardboard on the inside, which makes this stiff and unyielding. It also means that if it gets bent out of shape there is no reversing it.\n\nThe last one is that the business card holder is not actually large enough to hold business cards. You would have to put them in at an angle, which sort of defeats the point.\n\nOtherwise, this pad is large enough to hold a standard size laptop, a pad of paper, some business cards, and a pen.

They are thinner fabric so they'll be able to be worn in summer but not so thin that you feel exposed in them. At the moment I am a very curvy 165 pounds and I am 5'6\" and these pants have enough stretch in them to be not only forgiving, but even very flattering to my Kardashain/Lopez sized behind. They look high waisted in the picture but on me they do sit a little lower because of my proportions. If you have less booty than I do though they will come up a little higher. They will fit a pretty wide range of sizes. I would say that if you are anywhere from 125 pounds to 175 pounds, these will probably fit you. I don't have much of a tummy but I can tell that if you do have a little bit it will still look flattering on. This fabric is NOT super tight. You can actually breathe and move in them. They are also a little longer so taller girls can wear them too.\n\nI plan to wear these in Vegas with a long black tunic top that has mesh on the lower half of it and then some black ankle boots or sandals.\n\nIf you see these and love them, get them.

The fabric is soft & lightweight, but not see-through. It measures about 27 inches long from the highest point of the shoulder to bottom center.

My hips are almost 37 now. The sides on this top can be adjusted & tied tighter, which is flattering to those of us with smaller hips. Most tops that fit my bust, & not curve-clinging to my belly, are so big at the hips that they look like maternity tops. Not this one. It does not emphasize the belly area & yet does not look like a maternity top on me! Small miracle! The short sleeve top I bought of this brand fit the same. If my bust or hips were bigger, or if I liked tops over-sized, I would definitely go up a size. I am sure you could get this to shrink if it was a little big.

I had found uses for the previous wigs which was a lucky coincidence.\n\nPositives:\n~exact color I needed\n~the wig was pretty full for the price it was at, the netting only showed when I moved the hair around a lot.\n~The netting for the wig was black, which is much less noticeable on this cover wig than if it had an off-white netting\n~Wig fibers were soft and felt like real hair\n~The curls were very well in tact\n~It was packaged neatly\n~Comes with a wig cap\n\nNegatives:\n~The shipping took a few weeks but I ordered this one during Halloween season so it was to be expected.\n\nAdvice:\n~DO NOT use human hair products on synthetic wigs!  Some human hair products can burn through or damage the synthetic fibers! (especially hair sprays and shampoos)\n~Condition the wig with synthetic hair conditioner (can be found at most local hair supply stores like Sally's) in order to avoid major frizz, which happens over time\n~Do not keep the wig on the wig head for too long, if you aren't going to use the wig anytime soon it is best to pack it up and store it neatly in order to increase it's life expectancy\n~DO NOT keep your wigs out in the open near fans, open windows, or anywhere prone to major gusts of wind, drafts, or heat\nthis can damage your wig.\n~If possible, comb your wig gently layer by layer starting from the bottom. I usually use my fingers because It helps me have better control of how gently I comb, but if that is not your thing, use a wide tooth comb.\n~I do not recommend using heat on this wig unless you want to straighten it. If you do use heat put it on the lowest heat setting.\n~RESTORING CURLS\nAfter a long time the curls will eventually fall out, but fear not, the best way to restore the curls is to gently rinse or dampen the wig, apply overnight curlers (no heat).  Since the wig would still be wet after you apply the curlers, gently lay it one half of the towel, then fold the other half of the towel over it gently and let it sit for 2 or 3 nights.  If you want the wig to be really curly, let it sit for even longer. The curls will come out pretty tight, but they will loosen a little bit when you let it sit on the wig head for an hour or two, then play around with it as needed.", "summary": "`Good quality for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1415836800}

I am a 3XL kind of guy, so a jacket being too large on a large guy is weird and unattractive... As far as I can tell, the jacket fit perfectly! it was loose enough to fit a hoodie underneath for the colder days, but tight enough where it gave me a full range of motion without swimming in my coat. I live in Wyoming, and our winters can be quite a bit nippy, but this jacket was perfect for me on the days where it lingered in the 30 degree range, and a hoodie underneath would leave me comfortable down into the teens. It is stylish, and the buttons are sewn on well. I also appreciated that it was a good length, I have had poorly made pea coats in the past that hadn't properly covered up my backside when I bent over, and... being a large man with issues of a revealing lower backside... this coat covered things up so I didn't feel so uncomfortable... My only complaint would be that one of my pockets already has a hole in it, but I do utilize my pockets, and it could have been I just put something too heavy in there, so that can chalk up to user error... not manufacturing flaws. I purchased the jacket back in November 2015 (It's now April 2016), and I have used it frequently and heavily. It's a great jacket, and if you are a larger man trying to look nice, this coat will do the trick. It doesn't hide the fact that you own a pet if you have one, though... But that is also something that is chalked up to user error.. dog hair + dark wool coat = hair galore...

Amazon has sold out and Ebay has only\nthe yellow version of this watch left, and in limited supplies.  I purchased another one and two grey ones over\nthe past few months so that I have several of them for future use.\n\nAfter several years I still say that this is the best value in watches on the market.  They keep great time,  have\nseveral useful functions are only need a battery replacement every few years.  They are a tremendous value\nand it's unfortunate that HDE has chosen to discontinue them.\n\nUPDATE:  4/17/18 -  I just purchased two more HDE solar assist watches.  After several years of ownership and use,\nI still highly recommend these watches. Given their reliability, practicality and affordable price, in this consumer's\nopinion, there's nothing out there that can compete with them.\n\nI've been using HDE solar power watches for several years now and I don't think that there's a better value in a watch to be found anywhere in the market place.  In reality the HDE is a solar assist powered watch, since it has a button cell battery that is constantly  recharged by the solar collectors on the HDE.  In my experience these batteries last about two years under constant use before they are no longer able to hold a charge.\n\nYou'll notice when they start to fail, because some of the watch functions will no longer operate properly.\n\nFortunately, the batteries can be purchased in volume packets so that the cost of each battery is around twenty cents, and watch kits which contain the tools needed to replace watch batteries can be had inexpensively.  If you consider how much you'd spend just to have a  jeweler change the battery in your watch, a watch kit can pay for itself in the one or two visits that you would make to a jeweler.\n\nMoreover,  these  watches are more durable than one might imagine.  I've accidentally banged mine around on more than one occasion and they stand up well.\n\nThey also keep good time and have useful functions including:  both military and standard time,  the day of the week in both written as well as digital format, a stop watch, a programmable timer, and an internal light which can be activated with the push of a button, and which lasts for several seconds.  This is great if you like to walk or jog in the evening so that you can monitor how long you have been exercising.\n\nThe HDE is also water resistant.  That does not mean to go swimming with it. However, if you accidentally get the watch wet while you are washing your hands, you won't damage it.  I've seen this same watch for sale on other Websites for as much as $30,  so for less than $10 delivered,  the HDE  is a great value.\n\nAfter several years of use I still highly recommend the HDE, since it's a terrific product for the money!", "summary": "Best Value In A Time Piece Available", "unixReviewTime": 1521936000}

(The other was  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007Z4KBXU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  for $39).  This is definitely higher quality than the other silver sandal and seems nicely made.  It's not as perfect as the official photo, but it's very good.  The prongs holding the diamonds are themselves rather large and shiny, so they tend to pop out more than the diamonds.  This may have been deliberate since even lesser quality, non-showy diamonds are expensive, and to have clear diamonds with laser-rainbows would be extremely expensive--but shiny diamond prongs are not so expensive.\n\nThe pendant came in a really nice box with ribbon.\n\nThe dimensions of the pendant are listed in the seller's description and I wasn't surprised by its size.  Amazon's \"Product Dimensions\" area in bold is notorious for being more the typical shipping box size, not the actual item's dimensions.\n\nThe gift recipient was offered the choice of this pendant and a yellow gold one, and chose the gold one.

There are no under wires, there are thin pads in the top, but they are more for keeping nips from showing than for pushing anything up.  Although as with any halter style top there is some enhancement as halters always pull them closer and higher.  This does tie behind the neck so be aware if you have large breasts it can get stressful on your neck if you tie it too tight. The bigger the breast, the heavier they are, the more it pulls, it's gravity.  I though the fabric was normal for a swim suit and seems to be put together well. Color is right on with the picture, the top and bottom match perfectly.  All in all I think this is a great suit at a great price!", "summary": "I bought a large and it fits great.

Perfect length, seems sturdy. Unlike most cheaper necklaces, there is a loop built into the shape of the pendant to attach to the small connector ring which holds it into the chain (look closely at the image). Never a chance of not being able to reattach it if for some reason I need a new chain.\n\nThe bronze one is perfect, smoothly welded/pressed, nicely aged, uniform color, chain matches the pendant perfectly.\n\nThe silver one, however.... it's uneven, almost lumpy looking, in spots along the triangle (cloak) - not sure how that happened. Parts of the metal at the corners weren't knocked out properly. I fixed that myself with my pocketknife, not a big deal. While on the bronze pendant, the circle (stone) was attached minimally at both sides to the triangle (below the surface of the pendant on both sides), on the silver necklace, it is completely unattached on one side, and overly attached to the point of being visible on the other side. Finally, in the middle of the triangle, the wand is slightly thin at one point; it is not the same on the bronze pendant nor is it accurate. Very odd, but not so glaringly bad as to return it; unless someone gets about two feet away from my chest, they won't notice.\n\nAgain, these are both beautiful, and I intend to keep them both, but it seems as if the silver one was made with a different process than the bronze one, and it didn't come out as well.\n\nOverall, very happy. Perfect length, hangs right on my sternum, not in cleavage or on collarbones.

I'm very pleased with this hat. It's made of good quality materials. The material is medium weight, so it's not too stuffy on warm summer days and nights in Southern California. The brim is slightly flexible, but it's not flexible to the point where the look of the porkpie hat can be altered. You won't be to have this hat double as a Porkpie Hat and as a Baby Fedora. The black band adds a nice contrast to the blue color of the hat I purchased. I've tried on other brand hats where the wool felt and the band were the same color, but I didn't like that look. This is an excellent hat and people have had positive comments on it every time I've worn it. Several asked where I got and wanted all the particulars. If, you want a Porkpie Hat, you cannot go wrong buying this one. I wear a 7 and 5/8, so the XL fits my head well without altering the shape of the hat.

If you are lucky like the ones who gave rave reviews, the dress will look just as photographed.  It will have a lot of extra, cascading fabric draping slightly longer on the sides than the middle.  It will be roomy, it will have the May&Maya tag and the straps will be adjustable.\n\nIf you are unlucky like me and have a dress shipped to you by ODIDI, you will be sorely disappointed (or livid) like all those giving 1 star only because 0 star is not an option.  What you will get is a very poorly constructed, thin, see through narrow boxy dress, with too long straps that are not adjustable, with tight chest area, and a shapeless narrow box of a body that does not have the extra fabric that causes the cascading and interesting hemline.  The adjustable strap is a critical feature to dresses like this, and even more so if the straps are already way too long.  The stitching will be very poor quality and the dress unfit for wearing out.  It will look more like a poorly constructed slip dress intended to be worn underneath something else.  Actually all my slip dresses are of infinitely higher quality than this piece of trash. The dress will arrive without any tags or labels other than one tiny size tag sewn on by an infant.  Although the listing describes the dress as being made of cotton, it is actually very thin, see through rayon that has zero drape and stretch.  A complete abomination all around.\n\nIf you alert seller ODIDI to the blatant bait and switch, expect no response.", "summary": "Be very careful who you buy from; stay away from seller ODIDI", "unixReviewTime": 1435708800}

Walk away. The aiming/lasers are too big on the side of the helmet, and the black cover is not painted to go along with your color choice. I ordered the black silver, and my cover is black. The mesh eyes are barley glued in, and a some spots are bent into the plastic for a better hold. The top part of the bio mask is separate from the mask. So you have to insert the pegs into the holes, and slide them into place. Just be careful doing it as the plastic pegs want to give. In the middle brow above the eyes you see a perfect dot. Well that is a flat screw you have to put in once you've connected the top of the bio mask on. There are some gaps as it's not a perfect fit. If you're looking at this for a paintball or airsoft mask. It will just break on you. It is extremely unsafe, and I don't believe it was made for it. The straps are pretty lame as well. Same as the pegs. Just slide the hole over the peg, and slide it into the smaller position. Also another thing with my aim/laser I had to unscrew the back to uncover the lasers. Then I had to pry the circuit board out of its hole, and find a plastic pull sheet to get the batteries active. Just to find all three lights do not go on at once. There's four lights in total. The first light is a red laser, the second light is a really bright white led, the third light is a bright red led, and the fourth, and final light is a blue led. How is it all of the lights are different? Why is it I can't have three lights go on at once for a PREDATOR effect? I would send it back, but it being shipped to China I don't see me getting my money back.

The not so good is that I haven't been able to get the laser light working and the mask comes with no instructions.

Also, I wanted to comment that in the photos, the mask seemed to have a shiny surface, the actual mask (I bought the Silver) however is not shiny -- though, it does look good.

As I normally wear a small, a medium at most, I went ahead and ordered a \"large\" as I like to wear thick sweaters during winter and it would not zip past my chest. Admittedly, I wear a 36 D so that might be part of the reason as the rest of the coat was quite loose. Point is, I ended up having to order an extra large which is shown in photo. This coat is probably an American 8. Despite this weirdness with sizing, the jacket is very much well worth it, just be sure you order 1 or 2 sizes larger than you would normally. So if you normally wear a small, you should get get a large, unless you intend to not wear a sweater or thick shirt below it, for instance.  Otherwise this company is great!

The Secrid wallet is on a whole new level, it looks amazing, feels really great, its actually metal as opposed to plastic of the ACM wallet. It is extremely thin and fits into my pocket very easily. The clear slide on part is useful for carrying cash and other cards. I can fit more than 10 bills inside easily plus an insurance card. It is also removable so you can just carry the metal cardslide itself if you want. It looks like it should last a long time and the mechanism to push the cards out works very well. You can see them fan out really nicely while being held on tightly so that nothing falls out. I have not tried out the RFID blocking capability yet.\n\nThis is my review for the dark grey one, and it is the same for this gold one too. Only thing, that I didn't like about this gold one, is that the color isn't very goldlike. It seems more copperish in color. But that is just my own opinion.\n\nOverall, I think I might buy another one for later just in case.

I currently have about 7 cards in the cardside (the pink part), all of different widths. In the sliding tray, I hold all of my punchcards, loyalty cards and health insurance cards as well as a bill or two in the event that I need cash. the cardslide's mechanism works great and can be easily used with one hand. It's a great wallet for someone who doesn't want something large or bulky.\n\nAs for the color...I personally love this tone of pink. It's pretty subdued and not in-your-face at all. I'll admit that when I first got it, I couldn't stop staring at it--it's a very pretty pink.

Stuff stuff and things in it and shove it in my pocket; weeks later I clean the wallet out and it is light again. This minimalist wallet from Holland is remains light because you can't stuff much in there. I have 6 cards in mine; two of them are embossed. I have the cardslide attachment which is great to have for some extra cards; I fit three in there and stuffed a few 20$ Bills there for when cash is king. If there are no cards in the cardslide attachment, it is a little difficult to stuff cash in there due to the design of the thingy in the bottom that holds items tightly.\nI usually hold my leather wallet in my left hand and pull cards out with my right hand. It takes a little getting used to holding this Secrid wallet in my right hand and pulling cards out with my left hand. OR after I pull the lever, I put the wallet in my left hand and use my right hand to pull cards out (confusing, right?). I think if this wallet was left hand friendly, I'd prefer to pull the lever with it in my left hand.\nAnyway, the RFID blocking is a bonus. This wallet doesn't really work in a back pocket, front pocket carry preferred or in cargo pants, or in a man bag :-P\nIf the lever sticks, take all the cards out and put them back in. Cards won't fall out unless you shake it super crazy hard or use rotational velocity to flick the cards out with your wrist.\nMetal finish is nice and I love the blue color.\nI'll be buried with this wallet unless a better version of this one is made!", "summary": "I'll Never Use a Leather Wallet Again", "unixReviewTime": 1466380800}

This is a favorite comfort outfit. It is so comfortable!  It's cute but not too cutsy. The cotton fabric is kind to my skin. The cuffs at the wrists and ankles help keep me warm. The zipper makes it easy to get on and off. The hood is nice. It will keep your head warm when your hair is wet, like when you just get out of the shower. If you are wet in a cold room, this outfit is the fastest way to get something warm on. Don't stand there and shiver, step into this and sip it up and you will feel better right away.\n\nFor me, the best part is having no waistband. I have certain difficulties in the abdominal area, which you don't need to know the details of, but let's just say at the end of the day it is nice to slip into something that doesn't apply any pressure to that area at all. It's great. I can stretch and breath in this garment, and I love how comfortable I feel when I wear it. Big thumbs up on this one.", "summary": "Favorite lingerie", "unixReviewTime": 1485561600}

The color is just as it looks in the product photo. I think it's really cute and comfortable but it wasn't really what I was expecting. I'm 5\"8\" and ordered a large.  It feels very loose on me. I think a medium would be better. It's just a few inches below my breasts. I was hoping it would be lower and I could wear it with leggings.  Although it's plenty long enough in the back, it's a bit short up front to wear with leggings (see pics).  I'll still wear it, but I was just hoping for something a little longer up front. Pay no attention to the wrinkles in my photos.  I just took it out of the package.\n\n**Updated review**\nI wore this to work today with black pants and got a lot of compliments!

These are the ONLY pair of fleece lined leggings I have found that are not see through on me (like I said, wide hips), even when you bend over. They are incredibly comfy and warmer than any other pants I have (wore them in single digits). I know people are complaining about a \"chemical smell\" but I've never found a pair of fleece leggings that don't have an odd odor. I don't think it's that bad as long as you aren't very sensitive to smells and I don't really notice it after the first wear. On me, they come up past my belly button and are a bit big in the waist but that's expected on a \"one size fits most\" item for me. I ended up ordering a second pair because I need these in my life in the winter.

I'll preface this by explaining my usual trouble in finding a good pair of black tights.\nI'm 5'2\", 130 lbs and I've always had thighs of steel. What can I say, I'm a meaty yet surprisingly petite gal.\nAny lady that's ever tried to purchase leggings knows the all to common problem of... the dreaded camel toe. Rest assured that these tights will not give you that! The fabric is so thick and stretchy that it smooths out any lump, jiggle or imperfection.\nAnother frequent problem is the opacity of the fabrics. Nothing is worse than finding a light, comfortable and flexible legging only to find out everyone can see the goods in daylight. Somehow these tights have managed to be lightweight AND completely opaque. Like I said, I'm in love.\nThe final selling point for me is the higher waist. I frequently fall victim to the pseudo muffin top created by pants that are too low on my hips, or lack there of. These come up just right before the belly button, and have a two inch thick band at the top to hold it all in place. As with the high-waist trend, I frequently get a cute pair of high waist pants, and the first time I sit down I feel like my abdomen is being crushed and I can't breathe. These tights won't do that! They stretch and move with your every movement. Seriously, I never want to take these off. ESPECIALLY given that the price is so low.

The fabric is a nice fabric, and the coat is well made, including lining.\n\nA steal at $40.  I plan to wear it while teaching as well as in more casual settings, which is exactly what i hoped for.  It came almost 2 weeks before the earliest estimated date, which was also nice (this shipped from China, and for me took 2 week from order date to having it in my hand).\n\nNote also Chinese sizes are different than US sizes, so paying attention to the measurements they provide is key.

I basically paid to try it on. I love Amazon (esp Amazon Prime!) for it's amazing shipping and returns, but I should have read more carefully when I purchased this item.

They are indeed over-the-knee socks.

I was aware that this would take quite sometime to ship and unsure if it would be good quality.  The price was a definitive draw, and I decided to take a chance.  I ordered on November 17 and received the item on December 15.  Upon opening it, the first thing I noticed was the quality of the material.  The photo online makes the coat appear fluffy and plush, but this material was quite thin.  I also quickly noticed that several of the buttons were loose and that small threads were visible from some of the seams.  I tried the coat on, thinking that it looked much smaller than the photo.  The coat in the picture comes down several inches below the models hips, and I could visually see that this coat was much smaller.  I did fit the coat, though it was a bit snug and only came to about belt level on my pants.  I am normally a small-medium, in shirts and wear a size 5/6 jeans.  I ordered a medium from this seller and was not pleased with the fit. This is not a coat I would wear to keep me warm or on a regular basis, though it would look cute as a fitted jacket with the right pants.  I would have never ordered this item if I had seen a picture of what it really looked like. The photo used by this seller is not representative of the quality or size of this coat.  I know that I was taking a stab in the dark ordering a $20 coat from China, but I could have taken that $20 and going to Wal-Mart and bought an inexpensive puffy coat that will keep me warm, last longer than this coat, and still looks cute.

I might consider ripping out the seam and re-sew it for a better fit.\n\nI prefer shirts to be a bit longer and this length is at my limit on the short side. Ladies who wear low cut jeans will probably want an additional base layer to cover their back skin when bending over.\n\nThe back, like other reviews, does not have lace but is a stretchy polyester, spandex sort of material.

Holds only what you need and not much more.\n\nThis wallet is simple and, as such, has a slim form factor, which is what I prefer because I wear my wallet rather than carry about a purse.  If you use the side with the pouch to hold a lot of coins, it can get fat (and heavy).  The card access from the top is great for holding a few cards, but not much more than that, and there is no way to organize if you are trying to carry more cards.  I typically carry just one credit card and my ID in the center card access part.  The internal card holder (the one in the pouch) is difficult to use (especially if you have coins in the pouch) and I do not use this one very often.  This wallet is beautiful and well made.  It has held up to constant abuse (I am not nice to my utilitarian things) and even after all this time there is not one loose stitch or busted seam.  The wallet feels a little plastic-y, but that is fine by me.\n\nIf I have any complaint about this wallet, it would be that it is inadequate to hold receipts, which is unfortunate for me because I save my receipts religiously.  It means that instead of having a wallet of receipts to clear out once a week or so, I have to be sure to file receipts every day from my pockets, which is inconvenient, but worth it to have a slim wallet profile.", "summary": "Slim, Well-Made wallet that withstands abuse", "unixReviewTime": 1496102400}

The one star is for the funny phrase on it, that made me laugh.\nFirst- for a funny womens shirt pointing out a rack, the shirt will not accommodate a woman with any medium-large+  amount of a rack (boobs), unless they're the size of a small teenager.\nSince I know that I have to size up for my bust, I ordered the largest size available, a 2X. (For reference, my measurements bust-waist-hips are 55-35-40 in inches.)\nAs soon as I opened the box, my husband and I were like, oh no. That won't fit over my boobs. I still wanted to try it on, in the hopes that it would be stretchy enough. With help from hubby, we got it over the boob-mountain, and the hem of the shirt then stopped at my midriff. So my bust raised the front of the shirt up, and exposed my tummy.\nThe 2X *might* fit like a smallish size large, but the seams close to the armpits looked loose after the one time try-on, which leads me to doubt the durability, quality, and workmanship of the shirt. For $16 though, you get what you pay for!\nThe colors of the designs on the shirt are very muted, not bright, with an almost a faded look.

This was the only wallet-easy item that fit the bill. Whether it's leather or faux leather, I'm not sure (would prefer faux leather - I don't condone the killing of an animal just so I can have a bag), but it's sturdy! It fits three to four large notebooks, or a couple small notebooks and my (fairly small) laptop. And it literally goes EVERYWHERE with me, due to the nature of my work.\nAdditionally, my cats approve of it, too.

Welch", "reviewText": "I am quite large at 300lbs and 5'4\", so what better example can anyone think of to really give these a test-wear? Here's an honest review from an online-leery pants shopper!\n\nI love comfortable pants and leggings. I was very excited to see a 4-pak of leggings for about $32 for the 3x size I needed. After judging the current reviews, I figured it would be worth a chance. I ordered the 2 black/2gray 4-pak without expecting perfection.\n\nThe items came fast (thanks Amazon Prime!); the coloring was as expected, and the value is great. I am wearing the gray ones now and they are not see-through. I'm glad of that because my underwear drawer is \"not boring!\" May update later to let you all know how the black ones turn out see-through-wise.\n\nThey feel very comfy and they fit great - the only issue I have is the waistband rise in the back. A long enough shirt to cover will still be just fine, but I wish the back can go a wee bit higher to cover up the small bit of undies that show; hence the reason for the 4 star rating. I suppose lots of larger ladies understand the issue of pants and things not going up high enough in the back. I can bend over and jump around and the pants will not roll off my stomach, so that's a great feature!\n\nIn short, for about $32 for 4 pairs, these would be excellent for comfortable wearing to everyday stuff and hanging out at home. I'd likely buy them again; let's just see how their durability is. Thank you for reading!\n\nUPDATE: Wearing one of the black pairs now; very comfortable, but do seem a bit more see-through than the gray ones. Still not much to worry about if your shirt is long enough!\n\nOne thing I did notice was that the waist rise in the back is much better, which leads me to believe that no two pairs of the same size are alike, so beware of this. Try on all pairs you receive! Hope this helps!", "summary": "Everything is Great - Except the Waistband", "unixReviewTime": 1419897600}

Some have very chubby feet. For that reason most baby shoe manufacturers err on the side of making a wider shoe to fit most of those chubby feet.  This manufacturer essentially shrank an adult shoe and put in a soft sole.\n\nMy daughter is currently a size 6.5 and i bought these in a size 7. While the boots are a tad too long, they fit her almost like socks In every other way including the shaft.\n\nFrom what my pedi advises baby feet need relative freedom to grow( she's an advocate of letting babies go barefoot as often as possible) so this shoe is breaking that rule. Because its leather and a soft one at that im hoping it will loosen up with wear... But by the time that happens she may be in another size.\n\nThese aren't issues that should be present in a baby/toddler shoe. Most parents won't be bothered to stretch a kids shoe and they shouldnt be.\n\nHopefully they revisit this as these are very cute well made shoes but its all for naught if they will prove uncomfortable or detrimental to the wearer.\nLuckily i bought them very heavily discounted or they would have been a return for sure.", "summary": "Too narrow for baby feet.", "unixReviewTime": 1431302400}

When I saw these on Amazon they looked and sounded really good so I took a chance on them and I have to say they have gone way past my expectations. They are made of a light combed cotton blend material which I want in a summer / spring sock, and they look and feel really good on my feet plus the fit is perfect!! In the description it says they are sized for a men's 6-9 shoe size and that description is spot on. I'm a size 8 1/2 and the heel actually stays on my heel and doesn't ride up like those one size fits all you usually get in the stores. And, there's 14 pairs of them as the photo I posted almost shows, in the photo there is only 13 shown because the 14th is on my feet. Like I said these are a light weight sock and not meant for cold weather wear and  not for someone over a size 9 - 9 1/2 shoe although they might stretch out enough to fit a bigger size. These socks will be replacing the lighter crew socks in my sock draw and I'm sure I will get plenty of wear out of them. I did receive a discount on these in exchange for a honest and unbiased review but let me assure you that if it weren't for the fact that this offer came with 14 pairs I would definitely be buying more at the regular price!", "summary": "Amazing Comfortable Socks!", "unixReviewTime": 1458691200}

They stretch perfectly and honestly fit my feet so that the heel lines up with the ACTUALY HEEL ON THE HUMAN BODY. Not only that the socks don't seem to have excess material and I get the feeling that this is truly a one-size-fits all type of sock. It literally does not feel like its too tight and it feels like its a very flexible sock. Additionally, it seems like one of those socks that if it got old, it wouldnt necessarily generate holes while the rest of the sock remains intact. It actually feels like one of those socks that may lose a few threads here and there but still maintain the same silky feeling as day one. I wouldnt recommend washing this in hot water but even after I washed a few of these socks, they remained silky and hardly lost any quality whatsoever. They are a very high quality pair of socks that I would recommend with flying colors. One last thing to keep in mind about these socks is that, the colors they provide are of the more vibrant quality as in the greens and oranges are not muted so it would definitely be difficult to wear these socks as part of a business professional outfit. However, if you wear brighter colors these socks are definitely for you.\nDue to my experience as a reviewer, I was chosen to review this product, which I received for a small discount.

The material is kind of thin , so I do not think these are long lasting socks, but they are nice for some of my tighter shoes. I gave a couple to my brother, and he likes them too but agrees they will not last very long. They were great to get because I got the whole pack for less than $15, but I would not spend more than that.

So the price was definitely right.\n\nThis is the second Wilson Jacket I've owned in my lifetime. The other was in my Youth and I was very happy with it.\n\nShipping was slower than I wanted due to the lack of Prime Shipping. But the real aggravation was the lack of tracking details. However it showed up soon enough and well packaged.\n\nThe jacket is lighter (lamb vs cow leather) than others I've considered. So it likely won't provide quite the same protection if you down down on a bike. However it's very modern in style and softer than say a traditional biker jacket. I'm a medium built guy and it fits perfect in the arms even when stretched out on the handlebars. It's not too tight around the body but enough that it won't flap around in the wind.\n\nThe jacket is very comfortable. I like the zips on the wrist for easy in and out. The two outer chest zip pockets are great for glasses, wallet, phone etc.  Two side hand pockets are nice too plus two more internal pockets. It's a shame the liner doesn't zip out for warmer summer rides but it should be ok. Looks perfect for spring and fall weather rides. It would have been nicer if the draw buttons on the waist had a second snap to draw it in as there really is only one position making the feature more style than function.\n\nSo far I am very happy with it.

I'll have to echo the negative reviews.  And I can see that both the comments that the fit is too small and too big could be right.  I'm 6' about 200#.  Based on the sizing information I ordered a large.  Large was about the right size through the body; maybe a little tight.  But the arms were essentially non-functional.  You couldn't reach.  There were no gussets at the shoulders like you would have with most motorcycle jackets.  I'd be doing good if I could get something out of my pockets.  I was going to try to exchange it for the next larger size . . but there was no way to do that.  Because the order was not directly sold by Amazon but rather supplied by Wilson's Leather I could only get a refund.  BUT, because the reason was it didn't fit . . I had to pay the return shipping.  Basically it cost me the return shipping charges just to try on the coat.  Risky business.  If I had been able to exchange it for a larger size it may have given me some room to reach in the shoulders . . but then the body may have been too big.  It's a well made coat.  I liked the leather.  It has a lining that isn't removable.  A little heavy.  If the shoulders would have had gussets that allowed one to reach I would have kept the coat.

Some times we can't find clothes or shoes (size 14) that fit him in a regular department store.  I have tried to purchase clothing for him online and so far, even the largest sizes are still too small for him.  His broad shoulders usually make shirts and coats look like their squeezing him.  We end up having to make costumes for him if he needs one.\n\nShopping for THIS \"costume\" in a size that would fit him was a chore.  I'm thankful that this seller had size 3XL.  I was worried that it still wasn't going to fit correctly.  Even though some listings (including this one) show a size chart, we find that a lot of times the sizes still don't fit right.  For me, it was a big risk since it's more than I normally like to spend on a \"costume\".  Plus since it's coming from over seas, returning it probably wouldn't be too easy.\n\nOur purchase arrived quicker than I had expected.  I'm really happy about that because I was expecting to have to alter it some how.\nWhen my son got home from school, he immediately tried it on.  To my surprise, IT FIT!!  ALL the way around!!!\n\nThe fabric was heavy duty.  I was very surprised that it wasn't really thin and see through like those Halloween costumes you get at the department store.  This one is going to last a while and he already said he wanted to wear it to school.  The buttons are a nice touch.  Detailed and sewn on well.  We saw no extra threads hanging.
