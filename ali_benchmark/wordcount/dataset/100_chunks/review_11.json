It absorbs water well: you can throw it on after the shower and yet it's ample enough to drink up water so that you don't feel you're in a wet rug.  It washed well the first time, and shrinkage seemed to be minimal; there was a lot of lint, but that's probably normal, and I haven't yet noticed the loose threads that other reviewers have noted.  Also, the belt is most definitely not too short; indeed, it's long enough to throw into a loose knot with some inches to spare.  The only drawback, surprisingly, is that this large robe is not especially dense or heavy; if robes were ranked like coats, this would be a spring/autumn one, not winter, since it just isn't heavy enough, even with that built-in muff around the neck, to keep you warm in a cool house.

I got it when I was about 15. I loved that robe. Soft and warm, it was my friend after every shower. Sadly that friendship came to an end several years ago when the robe finally fell apart. I mean literally fell apart. I opened up the dryer one day to find scraps and some lint and that was about it. I've never found another robe like it. I've resorted to stealing my husband's robe but there's something about it I don't like. It's not the color; it's the heavy, sweaty, non-breathing material it's made from. To be honest my husband isn't a huge fan either, for the same reason.\n\nThen I found the wonderful Egyptian Cotton Terry Cloth robe from Exceptional Sheets. This robe that is so similar to my old robe that it immediately takes me back. It's super soft. It's warm without being unbearable like my hubby's robe. And it wicks away water just like a towel. Even my husband loves it. Fortunately I had the foresight to get it in pink, so he won't wear it. Now the problem is that I have to buy one for him (in a different color of course).\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\nThe Egyptian Cotton Terry Cloth Robe by Exceptional Sheets comes elegantly packaged and was labeled with a ribbon and tag that read 100% Egyptian cotton. As soon as I saw the package I thought about the upcoming holidays and how nice of a gift this product would make. I ordered a pink robe and was pleased to see that the product I received matches the product pictured perfectly; this is often not the case when it comes to online purchases. I also feel it is noteworthy to point out that the robe shipped and arrived quickly.\n\nWhen the robe first arrived it had little fabric balls on it and it wasn't quite as soft as I had wanted it to be. This wasn't a problem because I wash all clothing prior to use so I washed it, following the directions provided, dried it, and found that the robe came out absolutely perfect. All of the fabric balls were gone, the color did not fade, and the robe was very soft.\n\nI also appreciate that Exceptional Sheets provides a size chart which takes the guess work out of ordering. I am 5'4\" and tend to order robes a size up; however, the chart would be perfect for anyone looking for the \"perfect\" fit. The robe hits right around my ankles, the fabric overlaps in the front when I close it, the belt is extra-long, and there are two deep pockets on the front.\n\nI absolutely love my new robe. If I could get away with wearing it to work I would in a heartbeat. After shopping a number of stores looking for a robe I can confidently say that I have not found a robe that compares to the price and quality of the Egyptian Cotton Terry Cloth Robe. This robe is an exceptional value and I look forward to ordering from Exceptional Sheets in the very near future.", "summary": "Luxurious, cozy, and thick", "unixReviewTime": 1380844800}

The inside front has two pouches and the inside back has one zippered pocket which holds my pens, lip gloss, etc.  There is also a full width zippered pouch sewn on the inside back wall.  I prefer that to a pouch sewn in the middle of the bag dividing it into two compartments because this bag holds more and the contents of the pouch don't get as crushed. I have two complaints. The first is that the buckle holding the shoulder strap to the bag often irritates my arm (I also tend to hold the strap/buckle as I walk so it irritates my hand/knuckle), but it's not a big concern.  My second, greater complaint is that the zipper to the inside back pouch broke off after less that one week of use.

I honestly believe that this piece deserves very high praise.  I haven't had it for 12 hours yet, so I'm unsure of how well it will hold up to the test of time but I absolutely love them, I am very pleased with my purchase.  I was a little hesitant at first due to a few reviews of customers having problems with the charms falling off?!  I work in retail (if you've ever worked in a retail environment I assume you may be able to relate and if you don't, I hope you can use your imagination).  Retail can be a very abusive place for any kind of jewelry.  As you may imagine, all I could think was how many things it could get caught on.  What would happen if it did? (it had no such encounter this evening, but again I haven't had it very long so there's still a chance it may). As of now this baby moved with me, not against me in my travels of helping customers, stocking the shelves, taking care of the photo department etc.  The fact that it looks AMAZING, and is over all a wonderful quality piece that I plan on adding to (as in getting additional items from ChubbyChicoCharms) are the reason's I decided to write this very long winded review that I'm trying to be thorough with.  As far as the writing being too small goes, it's not as small as I was thinking it would be after some of the comments.  I didn't measure it, but I want to say the charm is roughly 1/2 an inch??  I'm horrible with judging such things, but it feels like a good possibility.  If you've seen comparable bracelets with similar charms, it's the average size in my opinion.  Therefore it's not too small.  Yes, it can certainly be difficult to read, I myself didn't have that issue but I understand it.  Think about how many letters they had to fit on this sized charm.  It's realistic in my book for the lettering to be tiny, there's a lot on it.  Also, you are getting two bracelets with this purchase.  It's exactly as pictured, if you look close, it's clearly two bracelets, one resting on the other, however they are not attached, they move freely on your arm therefore you can wear them together, separately, gift one, whatever you choose. If I discover anything that might be useful to a potential buyer later on down the road and I am allowed to add information I will do my best to improve my review, but for now, this really is a great item, it's well worth the price.", "summary": "Very pleased, highly recommend!", "unixReviewTime": 1431734400}

I bought my first pair of Reva classics in 2008 and wore then exclusively until they were literally thinning on the bottom soles. They were comfortable and well made.  I recently decided to purchase another pair to replace them and I was very disappointed. The Revas are now being mass produced in Brazil and the quality and materials are very very poor. The cut of the shoe is not compatible with the foot as it has edges which are in direct contact with the metatarsal bones and this is sooo painful after a few mins of wearing them. The insole is a narrower cut as well , and it is not comfortable to your soles. The sizing is so off that this shoe needs to be ordered a size and halt larger than your actual size. I'm shocked that the workmanship has been downgraded to this extent, after all, the shoes are among the world's most popular styles. It now has the quality of a 9 West shoe and truthfully, the 9 West is more comfortable. It's unfair that the manufacturer is getting away with charging so much for such a substandard product.

When I didn't use them for pictures and such I let them fall down my back, which, according to my friend, made them look like a cape of sorts and so blended with the rest of my outfit, and I didn't have to deal with those hard white wings that are very unyielding to wear. (I used a safety pin to pin them to my bodysuit and I didn't have to deal with the annoying straps) When I had them on while dancing the sight was striking, as the wings flapped beautifully in the wind. The one downside is that, as a few reviewers have commented, the little loop that goes around your finger is not very sturdy and it ripped off the wing within the first hour of use. I imagine a couple of stitches to reinforce it would've prevented this, but I don't mind it as much as the actual wing didn't rip and it's a quick fix. One side of the wings is also more opaque than the other, which, while I personally didn't mind, might be a deal breaker for some (you can see the difference in the picture I attached). Finally, something I wish I would've done is iron the wings real quick because they still had the creases where they were folded during shipping.

Be prepared to wave your arms repeatedly to do any impressing. It is just loose straps over your shoulders then the strap you wear around the finger. Your arms must do alot of work to pull these off. If I had more time, I would have done some wiring--- that would have made them PERFECT. My daughter wore them for several engagements the week of halloween and they're pretty worn through, but rightly so.

I am a little tall (5'7\")  so it fit me just like on the model in the listing.

What a hit!\n\nBeautiful specimens!\nAs soon as I saw these beautiful earrings I knew I had to get them. And I had to order double so that each child could have her own set!\n\nThe jewels, we got the 7mm largest size, are lovely and large enough to look glamorous on any ear! We wanted them to be obvious, so of course, larger size. In 10 different colors they easily match most of their wardrobe! Very awesome plus!\n\nMy girls are allergic to metal. Also we have a skin issue where we heal far too slowly (I got my ears pierced when I was 8 and several decades later I still get infections as soon as the earring enters my hole and the hole is red before the earring back is placed behind it, and this reaction gets worse the longer I wear any earring. But I keep wearing them as my collection is too big to really get rid of [I must be some sort of a low level masochist, but my earrings just look so cuuuute!!!...] even plastic earrings send my ears into severe infection), so holes/piercing was out of the question for my girls, who have the same issue with skin healing.\nThey had been using stick on earrings for a while, but the glue itched and would leave small red rashes if worn longer than an hour. It did not seem to matter what kind of glue it was or who manufactured it, it was a casualty we had to deal with.\n\nThese are magnetic! The magnet is large and it holds very well! We were afraid we would lose them straight away, but they stayed long! Also, one child has metal allergy as well and we expected a small earring shaped green dot when she took them off. The metal paint did not react with her skin and she was able to wear these all day without any issues whatsoever! Also, we suffer severe pain for no reason, but pressure makes it awful, so I have to add that these earrings (I tried them myself) caused no real pain to be aware of. This was also a wonderful surprise for all of us after scouring several reviews about how they were too tight. We know pain. This was not pain.\n\nStyling Tips:\nWe found that when you style your hair first and away from the earring there is less chance of a stray wisp disconnecting the magnetic pull through the ear. Also, metal hair pieces should be placed far enough away so as not to interfere as well. The magnets are very strong! But it is always better to be safe than sorry.\n\nThe price was a little high considering the box it was sent in. That leads me to my Only grievance:\nThey arrived in a card stock sort of box. I expected a lovely Jewelry sort of storage box such as was advertised in the picture perhaps with felt and quality, but what we got was something even thinner than cardboard. That was really the only bad thing I can say about this. The box in the picture is not what we received. And let me tell you, as the giver of this item, I was a little embarrassed by the flimsy presentation. Great product, no real sort of storage for them :/ Super Bummer. I almost gave FOUR stars because of this oversight alone.\nBut as it did not infringe on the quality of the earrings, I left it 5 stars. Again, because we were just all so pleased that the earrings were so lovely!\n\nThe seller, Bundle Monster, packaged both of them smartly for the severe weather and they were not ruined inside. The outside... there was no protecting against the torrential rain that pelted our poor delivery woman. She is something special to go through all that for us! But the product was fine; even those very flimsy containers made it here dry thanks to the smartly finagled packaging.\n\nI would buy these again if I had to. We love the product. We wish there was a lovely box for storage, but we adore the gem jewelry and are pleased to be able to 'blend' with fashions here on that level. I recommend them to anyone wanting the pierced look but not the painful holes. We have already told many friends where to get them from and will keep telling anyone who will listen. They are that awesome!", "summary": "\"Pretty as a peacock and as sparkly as diamonds!\"", "unixReviewTime": 1451520000}

It has no \"snuggle factor\", lol!\n\nThere is nothing \"wrong\" with this top, it's a matter of preference and taste for the wearer.  It is quite a flattering fit, but the open mesh design makes it more of a spring/fall shirt, whereas I was wanting a warmer winter top (being listed as \"leisure\" made me think along the lines of comfy sweatshirt material --that is my mistake).

That's a good thing, I can move freely if I have to run in my heels for some reason or reach over something/someone.

Sometimes, long dresses make me look like a long board with no shape if I don't accentuate my hip area. This dress did very well with that, and once I threw on a black blazer it looked very professional.

My whole point in ordering this was to get that firm corset feel up top so I could feel slimmer. I don't have a long torso but I found the bustier runs short as well. That is not too big of a deal because the photo does show the correct length and some skin is supposed to show. I understand that.

For around $10US, I'm not sure I've ever had a better pair of sunglasses....and I'm talking about options >10X the cost.. And for polarized lens?! Incredible. Really. I've never owned a pair of Ray-Ban Wayfarer and these resemble those in terms of how they rest on your face. I don't have a huge skull, so the 55mm fits slightly bigger, but not like a massive pair of hipster frames that look like they are causing neck strain. ;) I do own a pair of Ray-Ban frames that are polarized and these zeroUV frames cost a fraction of what I paid for the Ray-Ban frames. Yes, the glass is definitely far superior in the Ray-Bans, but I am talking about my eyes looking THROUGH the lens and these zeroUV are very, very close to how comfortable they are in sunlight. To drive down costs, the glasses came in a plastic bag, but the packaging was a strong cardboard box and no damage issues with receiving them. Keep in mind that for cheaper frames, the hinges are typically not metal....these are and that makes a difference. The \"turtleshell-like\" pattern works pretty well if coordinating that color is your thing. The plastic that the temples (long, folding part that rests on your ears) are made out of is not the best quality, but for the price, I have zero complaints and several weeks of heavy usage has proven they are holding up well so far.\n\nI'd buy these again and would recommend them to family and friends.

There is no stretch to the fabric. I normally wear a small and ordered a large, which fits great in the shoulders (not too wide) and looks good worn with skinny jeans. I have worn a tank underneath, since the fabric is thin, but you could get away with wearing just a nude colored bra without anything showing. The gold stud style buttons are very cute, the gold doesn't look cheap and the color doesn't chip off like some cheap embellishments' color coatings might. In fact, they feel like solid metal (obviously not real gold, but an attractive metal). If gifting this item; I recommend having it shipping to yourself first, checking for loose strings, clipping them, and then gifting. Although sewn perfectly (no seams off centered or unraveling), there were a few uncut strings hanging from various seams, probably just the result of being manufactured at a quick pace. Again, this doesn't effect the quality of the garment, as they are easy to cut off, but gift wise, the random strings cheapen the look of the garment until clipped. There were only a few, so chances are you may receive a shirt with no loose strings hanging. The colors are true to the colors in the image. Overall, a very attractive, fashionable blouse.

Here goes:\n\n1 - It looks from all pictures like the crystal (hah like its crystal) is SMOKED and the LED elements are invisible normally. The crystal is NOT smoked. Each light emitting segment is clearly visible and for me, ruins the ENTIRE effect I was interested in.\n\n2 - The case and band pictured appear to be a light \"gun-metal\" color, which combined with the smoked crystal makes this watch look so cool ONLINE. What I received was definitely a DARK gun-metal color. This and the clear crystal with LEDs visible makes this watch just hideous.\n\n3 - You have to press a button TWICE to see the complete time. Once to make it flash (yay) and show you the hours (in blue LEDs), then again to show you minutes (in red LEDs) Personally I think that is just nonsense.\n\n4 - If you're looking for a binary watch, this is NOT binary. That doesn't bother me as I had learned that from reading elsewhere about this watch before ordering it, plus I still like this particular method of representing the time.\n\nMinor rants: Says there is a date function. There is not. Says exclusive fold over clasp design. Exclusive to watchmakers worldwide maybe.\n\nConclusion: Don't buy this piece of junk unless you want something that neither does what it is advertised to do nor looks like the photos.

This is addition and it's false advertising for them to suggest otherwise.\n\nSecond, this watch is heavy and kind of clunky.  It looks for the most part like it does in the picture but it's quite thick actually and less attractive in person.\n\nThird, to read the time you have to push a button twice.  Once to read the hours and a second time to read the minutes.\n\nLastly, I can't even open the clasp so I can put it on. I'm afraid I'm going to break the pin just to get it open.\n\nThis watch is not impressing me so far.  It does look kind of techno, so that's cool I guess.

Each blue LED represents an hour.\n\n3- After the blue lights come on quickly press button A again and you'll see the red LEDS illuminate reflecting the minutes. Each red LED represents 5 minutes. There is a triangle of 4 smaller lights in the middle; these represent one minute intervals each.\n\nTo set the time-\n\n1- Press button A once. When the blue LEDS light quickly press button B. The blue lights will now flash.\n\n2- Press button A for each hour increment. You'll see the number of blue lights increase with each press of button A. Do this until you have set the watch to the correct hour setting.\n\n3- Now press the B button again and the red LEDS will flash. Again press the A button until you have set the correct minutes.

The pictures are accurate as to what will be arriving. There are 5 outer layers that are the filmy, soft, netting type material, and underneath those is a thin, satiny slip *which is also the outer material of the elastic waistband*  It's a delicate skirt that I wouldn't suggest for rough wear...but it's adorable and will look amazing in the photo sets I plan on taking of my girls at the beach and dressed up as princesses.

I'm content with it, but not 100% happy. Although, considering it was only $15 with shipping, I'd say you get your money's worth.\n\nPros:\n-It came WAY earlier than estimated. It's Aug 4th, and it said it would come between Aug 15th and Sept 5th. I was surprised when I found it in my mailbox today.\n-The color is really nice. On my monitor anyway, it's identical to the photo. I got the green one.\n-I'm really small, 5' and 96 lbs. It's hard to find clothes that fit me properly, and while the skirt is a little lumpy, a small actually fits me really well! I pulled the band right above my bellybutton, and the skirt came to my ankles.\n\nCons:\n-There were some loose strands of thread coming off the band which still leaves me a little scared to wash it. The bottom looks like it was cut a tad choppy.\n-Speaking of washing, there is no care tag, so I'm going to hope it'll survive a cold wash on a delicate cycle, because I don't think I'll be able to easily wash it by hand.\n-The band is really loose on the inside and kept folding while I tried it on.\n-It's a little lumpy, as I said above, and while it fits my body well, the shape looks a little off, not like the photos. I'm hoping it'll fluff up and look better after I wash it.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend it, because it's a cheap skirt and it's not terrible quality. It just seems really delicate and there were a few minor annoyances but they're not a big deal. Others seem to have had more luck than I did. My biggest concern is how I'm going to wash it, and also what I'm going to wear it with. But I'm sure I can make both work.", "summary": "Not terrible.

It is layered but with the skirt I have, they are only two types of layers of fabric which was very disappointing since the product stated \"5-Layer\".\n\nOverall experience?\nI wore this and I love how it looks like. Its just the feel of the discomfort I do not like. People complimented me on how I looked and they said it looks really cute and unique. They asked me where I got it and I told them I ordered them from Amazon.\n\nWould I recommend?\nYes, I do recommend this but make sure you contact the seller if you have any complications and I'm sure they'll clear it out for you :) Or you can ask Amazon for some help :)", "summary": "You get what you pay for :)", "unixReviewTime": 1414454400}

I've been wearing the socks while running for the past month, they have held up well to both wear and washing - it should be noted I'm deployed to Afghanistan so the socks are under a little \"harsher\" conditions then may be normally expected.  I bought them expecting to throw them away at the end of my deployment but I don't think I'll need to.\n\nAs noted in other reviews, they feel a little thin out of the package, but being a toe sock it works to their advantage if worn with toe shoes where you don't have the space or need for a thick sock.\n\nI experienced none of the manufacturing flaws as noted in some of the other reviews, they are a good quality and a reasonable fit (I wear a size 10.5 mens// 42 in five-fingers).\n\nThe only reasons they got four instead of five stars is that the low-rise is almost too low; when wearing toe shoes (vibrams) the cuff of the shoe sits higher than the sock and due to the gap it causes a little rubbing on the ankle from the shoe.  Additionally, the second to last toe (neighbor to the pinky toe) is long, but that may be my feet and not the fault of the sock.\n\nOverall a great value when compared to other toe socks on the market and I would recommend them if you wear socks with toe shoes... they really cut down on the notorious \"five fingers of funk\" that so many toe shoes are subject to.

I purchased three blouses from this seller: two were fulfilled by Amazon and one from the seller. I have already received the blouses fulfilled by Amazon and they exceeded my expectations (which were quite low after reading other reviews). The blouses look exactly like what I saw online. The fabric was great, and there were no strings hanging off or all over the place. I was really pleased with the quality of the fabric, which I really liked, and they fit perfectly! I am 5'5/127 lbs and I ordered a small and the fit is on point.\nAs to the blouse that's being fulfilled by the seller, it's set to arrive mid March, which is approximately 1 month after placing the order.

I like boxer briefs. I used to wear Brooks Brothers until they discontinued the kind that I liked and replaced them with a cheaper version that is not the same. I spent the last year trying a lot of different brands from Jockey, Hanes, FOTL, and up to \"designer\" brands like Andrew Christian, CK, and a few others that weren't any good. These boxer briefs hit all of my needs. Great, substantial elastic waistband; no tag in the back; nice, cool cotton; absolutely no \"ride-up\" on the legs; no bunching in the crotch; and keeps my bits snug. Did I mention \"NO RIDE UP\"? They are fantastic and I bought enough for a week. I only hope that they will hold up over time, I'll have to follow up on this review at at later date, but for now I highly recommend these boxer briefs and I may also try their undershirts.\n\nUPDATE:  So, it's one year later. I bought a total of eight of these and wear one pair per day with a backup. They get washed once a week on delicate/cold water, tumble dry low. Seven out of the eight are just like they came out of the box. No see-through, stretched-out parts. As good as new. One of them developed a small hole where the waistband meets the fabric on the side, but it hasn't gotten any bigger and it doesn't affect anything, so it is still in rotation. Again, I would highly recommend these underwear. They cost more, but are great and they last.", "summary": "Best underwear ever", "unixReviewTime": 1371600000}

I have not yet worn these out in the real world but so far I like them and I would probably order more and in different colors.\n\nI have since worn these all day and I have come to another conclusion.  These fit and wear like tights, only they're footless, obviously.  I am 5'4/5'5 and these are not exactly capri length on me, they are mostly ankle length.  I still like the way they fit and I have worn them all day without any discomfort or irritation.  But they do feel like tights when you put them on and when you wear them.  So if you don't like the way tights feel between the thighs when walking, shorts might be suggested.  Also, wash before wearing.  I have noticed that they have a scent that is not pleasing to the nose.  This is a lesson I have learned the hard way.

Greenbaum", "reviewText": "OMG why is it not \"socially acceptable\" for a man to wear a Skirt!! I had been told in the past that I should try wearing a Kilt, as I enjoy feeling \"free\" while hiking or working. So after some quick research about fitting I decided I would jump into the Kilt world with the UT Utility Kilt which was priced a lot lower then a lot of the other products out there. Upon its arrival it seems to be very well made, out of a strong canvas material. The snaps are well made, as well as all the hems. As stated by other reviewers measuring is important, as you don't wear a Kilt at your waist, but higher up, so if you are like me, with a bit of a beer belly, you may need the extra couple of inches. It does have large belt loops also, so you can wear it lower and use a belt if you prefer.\nI absolutely love wearing it. I feel like I'm getting weird looks at the grocery store or out and about, but in the world we live in now, what should be so weird about a man in a Kilt anyway! I did have 1 time where where a group of teenagers made a comment, which I gladly remarked back that they should try it as its amazing to be free. It really makes me think what a weird society we live in, where a man in a Kilt is strange, but a women can wear a string bikini and its OK! I use it all the time for hiking, which is perfect as you have no chaffing, a nice breeze and no restrictions on movement. I do have to think twice when sitting down, and getting out of the car to prevent a \"sneak peek\", but that's getting easier. The pockets are deep and have ample room. I would like to have another pocket lined up more with where normal pants pockets are located, but that isn't that big of deal. So all those looking at these reviews you can't go wrong with this product, and I think it is a great introduction before you spend the big bucks on some other name brand...", "summary": "Born Free, Live Free!", "unixReviewTime": 1518652800}

The pockets are nice and roomy, too. Carries wallet and cell phone easily with room to spare.  Took two stars off because, like many kilts I've seen reviewed, this one frays at the edges of every cut piece.\nOne might expect that to happen with a kilt that has gotten a year or so of wear and tear, but this started happening after the first month of owning it, with zero washings.  The buckles are flimsy, as well.  I got this as a birthday present last year.  My birthday is coming round again, and one of the tines on the buckle - the piece that fits through the grommet - somehow bent backward and has to be reshaped every time I want to secure the strap.  Eventually it'll bend right off.  Again, not competing in any highland games, here. Just walking around wearing this kilt causes it to fall apart!\n  So, bottom line; it's comfortable, looks great, has roomy pockets; but if you want it to last very long it needs fray-check and the metal will probably need replacing down the road.  Probably also requires additional stitching, so hopefully you have a sewing machine or know a lassie who's clever with the needle & thread.", "summary": "Looks and feels great, but is not very rugged.", "unixReviewTime": 1510531200}

That old kilt is made of heavy canvas, colored a dull orange, and it wears like iron, but it doesn't move or flex unless I encounter a very heavy wind to move it. Because it doesn't flex, it looks very 'artificial'. I dyed it dark brown and washed it numerous times to loosen it up without much luck. My UT Kilt arrived and I tried it on immediately. It's half the weight of that old kilt, perfectly stitched fits wonderfully. I intentionally bought mine just a tad loose, and the measurement they sent me was precisely what I needed. DO pay attention to their size chart information. Measure about one inch below your belly button with a cloth measuring tape. Then I recommend that you add TWO INCHES to that measurement. My own waist is 36 inches. If I'd ordered a size 38 UT Kilt, it would have been exactly the right size. However, I most often wear heavier weight shirts, so I added 4 inches to my measurement, instead of just 2 inches. It's still just a tiny bit loose, and I can easily take up the slack with my waist belt,  and with the two waist straps and buckles built into the kilt. If I gain a bit of weight, or add an inch to my waist because of holiday feasting, I'm still going to have a kilt that fits properly. If you get it too small, it will NOT stretch to fit! I'm 6-feet tall; the kilt is 22-inches long from top hem to bottom hem, so if you wear it properly, the bottom hem partially covers your knees. Other kilts sold here on Amazon tend to run 24-inches long or longer, and the shorter 22-inch length was the final factor in my decision to buy from UT KILTS.The belt loops are exceptional, and the UT Kilt folks also carry ab excellent 2 1/4-inch belt that is perfect for the job. However, all the Celtic belt buckles listed here on Amazon are configured for a 1 1/2-inch belt, and there are numerous reviews discussing that mismatch in size. So I opted to continue using the 2-inch heavy leather work belt that I've worn for years with my old kilt. It will work just fine until I can find the right buckle. I'd recommend this UT Kilt to anyone who hasn't tried wearing a kilt before, and I give it TWO ENTHUSIASTIC THUMBS UP for any veteran kilt wearers who are considering a purchase.", "summary": "UT KILT's Dark Brown UTILITY KILT is a winner!", "unixReviewTime": 1499126400}

CA recently.  Basically the two of them have been folded in a drawer for nine or ten months, and I just pulled them out.  The Utilikilt looks near new.  The UT Kilt has multiple seams coming apart, one pocket is completely open on one side, and several of the pleats and seams are just not sewed shut any more.  Worse, the fabric is faded! Like, really blotchy faded!  Not from over washing, because where it's pleated or the material overlaps when you wear it, it isn't faded.  I think the dye they used just fades in the sun, and unevenly at that.\n\nThere has to be a happy medium between \"Falls apart in occasional moderate use\" and \"Expensive as all get-out\", so I'm trying some of the other brands on Amazon.

The box it arrived in was too small. The kilt was folded over so many times to fit in the box that when it came out I couldn't even try it on. Had to iron it before even making an attempt.\n\n2. The pleating is incorrect. To the average eye nothing appears wrong, but to people who wear and know kilts, it is wrong. The pleats are shallow, which is good for being active in heat, but the way they are done means the whole thing doesn't have room to flow (This was expected for the price).\n\nTHE BIGGEST PROBLEM... additionally, the pleats. They are made symmetrically, so the right side follows conventions but the left side is reversed, they meet at the middle of your rear and this completely throws off the way it flows around you. It's incorrect. This is the main reason I will not be wearing this out in public. It's fine as comfort wear, which which was the intention I had when buying it, no biggie. This is a pattern that I'd expect more on a military-style utility kilt, if ever there truly were such a thing.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this again as an entry-level kilt, the quality is better than elsewhere.", "summary": "Great deal for first timers", "unixReviewTime": 1459555200}

Also, good point, the pocket will tear off at the thread, so you can just hit it with a needle and thread, or with a sewing machine, and be back up to snuff in two shakes of a lambs tail.\nI personally bought it 2 inches too large on purpose, because I can just slip it right off if necessary and it isn't uncomfortable to sinch up.  Overall, if you are wondering whether you can wear one or not, or whether it is for you or not, as long as cost isn't an issue for you, go for it.  The freedom you feel, and the strength you get will make all the skirt talk worth it.", "summary": "Turn some heads", "unixReviewTime": 1416441600}

I finally bit the bullet, and I'm glad I did.\n\nSo what makes this kilt so great?\n\nFirst, the \"build\" quality.  UT Kilts makes a fine product.  This thing looks like it's going to be with me for a good long time.  The fabric is heavy-duty and the stitching is neat and solid.\n\nSecond, the pockets.  I love the pockets.  I didn't think I'd get much use out of the little slit-style exterior pockets, but they sit at th perfect height for me to stick my hands in them, and they do a perfectly fine job holding a tube of lip balm.  I suppose I could put change in there if I kept it in a little coin purse or something; instead, along with the lip balm (which pretty much lives there), I just stick anything in the slit pockets that just needs a home for a few minutes.\n\nAs for the large pockets, they're perfect.  They hold my epic phone (Samsung Galaxy Note) and my wallet, no problem.  That's about all I carry, but the phone is so big that there's just basically no getting it into a trouser pocket (cargo pants excepted, but I tend not to wear those).  I bought this kilt in part as a way to add more pockets to my cycling kit without actually adding full-on pants.  I haven't worn it on the bike yet, but I suspect it will do just fine in that regard.\n\nOne more note: don't be afraid to order right on size.  I ordered a few inches larger, because I was paranoid, and I shouldn't have.  It doesn't make enough of a difference that I feel like I should return this kilt (it doesn't fall off or anything), but a snugger fit would be a little better.", "summary": "Enormous Pockets FTW", "unixReviewTime": 1392163200}

This is my first kilt, so I'm not a kilt expert.\n\n1.  Go measure the thickest part of your waist RIGHT NOW.  Don't think you know what it is.  And don't think that there is any give in this kilt, either.  There isn't.\n\n2.  Undo the entire kilt before you try to put it on.  Don't try to slide it on like a tube.\n\n3.  The flat part goes in the front.  The belt loops go in the back.  There aren't any in the front.  You could wear a belt with this, but it would have to be a wide stiff one to look halfway decent.\n\n4.  The buttons go in the front.  There are two buckles on the side to help adjust the fit.\n\n5.  The pocket flaps on the side can be unbuttoned to store keys and a wallet.  There are no pockets for you to stow your hands, if you're used to standing around with your hands in your pockets.\n\n6.  The material is very heavy duty, almost like an Army tent, but not as rough.  This thing will probably last forever.\n\n7.  It seems like a good cross between a work outfit, like for hiking, and a formal outfit, like for a ceremony.  I bought a Scotland t-shirt to wear with this, and the t-shirt seems a bit casual and light-duty for it (pajama-like?).  I also think I need to get some hiking boots with wool socks to wear with this.\n\n8.  If you want to return it, the sellers are very nice and accommodating.  But you will also be out 20 bucks.\n\nWearing a kilt for the first time is strange.  You initially feel like you are wearing a dress.  But when you take it off and put on shorts, you will feel even weirder, like you are wearing some skimpy outfit.  So you'll go and put the kilt back on. Now it feels cool.  Functional.  Manly, because you are ready for anything: formals, chopping wood, laying around, flashing women who ask the obvious.

Yes that is a little metal tab but has not come loose or caught on anything so far..This has nice leather that does soften and get less stiff with use .  Oil will affect this leaving dark spots until it has worked into or out of the leather. Stitching is very even and have not seen any problems. only reason for four stars is the uncertainty of the edge cracking. Would i buy again , at this point yes I would.\nUpdate... It has now been close to two years and this is my everyday wallet and im quite impressed of how well it has held up.. Very durable . I now believe the edging it there to prolong edge wear on the leather.

It would be simple to add a charm or pendant to this necklace, adding to its practicality. These are available in multiple colors, so you can find one that would match any wardrobe.", "summary": "Simple, practical silicone rubber sport necklace", "unixReviewTime": 1384992000}

One of them did have a pearl loose as soon as I opened the package, but was otherwise perfect. The second one had several pearls loose, and one of the little cups the pearls get glued to was loose. I am a jewelry crafter as a hobby so I always have a tube of E6000 glue handy. This glue works wonders with things like this that are traditionally hard to glue. I just reglued all the pearls that had come loose. I also checked the fastness of all the pearls that weren't loose already. On the one headband with only one loose pearl, the others were all glued securely. In the end, both are perfectly wearable. I wore the one with only one loose pearl to my event and had a blast.

I threw it in a drawer and didn't think twice about it after I got it, when initially I was so excited about it! I give it 3 stars because it looks a lot better than something that came out of a penny machine, I do give it that, it isn't the cheap rhinestones you get from the dollar store, its the better stones similar to  quality ones you'd find at the Claries in the malls.  When I put it on after I got the thing to stay together, mind you I was so sad from waiting so long for it, but two, from the connections falling apart from the linkings (not major, normal with cheap jewelry, simple fix squeezing/bending the connectors) I put it on in my bathroom, and the thing was tight, I'm a petite girl, and I have a very small head and can normally wear kids headbands and accessories and hats without a problem, so it was a bit uncomfortable since the top part is metal, I figure i'll have to stretch the elastic out on it before I wear it.", "summary": "Meh, Nothing to be excited about, great for 2 bucks!", "unixReviewTime": 1389571200}

It all started with my oldest when I was tired of buying disposable diapers for swimming every day.  Yes, I said every day.  We used to live in Hawaii and we would swim every day.  My son (and now 2yo daughter) love the water so much they ask to go swimming on a daily basis.  Understandably, this can get expensive when you are swimming in the pool or ocean 4-5 times a week for 52 weeks a year.  I am not kidding.  Kids love the water.  Maybe they take after their surfing mamma, but hey I am not going to deny them I love it as well.\n\nAnyway fast forward to the girl, we recently moved to WA, with the ocean at sight this kid thinks she can swim in the Puget Sound with water temps in the 50's, uh no.  But I dragged out her overly used old pair that was waaay overused and drooped in the butt, so it always looked like she pooped and I had to break down and buy her another pair even though she is 90% potty trained.  Alas, I digress.  Amazon to the rescue!  After a full 14 day adventure driving from WA to RI and staying in hotels only with indoor pools, hey they have to get the sillies out somehow, i am pleased to say they still are the greatest purchase!\n\nI never seemed to have any of the problems with the fit issue.  I just go by what iplay has listed on weight and order accordingly without any problems.  So (fingers crossed) I have not encountered a poopy pants with my daughter in these, but with my son yes, oh yes!  And before you say oh dang so gross, the snaps on the side are a real lifesaver.  Back in the day I did not know about this amazing feature and did not purchase ones with snaps.  I would have to slide the poopy pants down and they would get all over! Him, his legs, the towel, oh my!  But these ones with the snaps are amazing!

I found them so great; I ordered them twice, as my little one grew. My daughter used both size: 6-12 months & 12-18 months. These swim diapers feature easy-lock side snaps (one side only); a snug fit which helps contain solid matter and is approved for public pools. TMI time, my little one had a few #2 incidents and each time there were no leaks, we were able to quickly get her to a change room  clean her and quickly rinse the swim diaper; she was back in the water in no time!. My daughter is small for her age, so I would imagine they may run small because I ordered her age appropriate size and they were tight; however for their purpose, I think tight is good. These are for babies and young children who normally need diapers or tend to have accidents in the water. I find these swim diapers to be economical because they are reusable and very easy to wash even on the spot. Ive only needed two diapers as my child grew and no other back up diaper is necessary. Another cool perk is that they are UPF 50+, which is excellent sun protection. The design is super cute too, so you could just purchase a swim top and your little one is ready for the pool or beach. Now, if you are like me and cant control yourself from buying cute swim suits, these swim diapers fit right under and you can barely tell they are on. I have provided photos from both my purchases to give you a better idea.", "summary": "So great; I ordered them twice!", "unixReviewTime": 1465689600}
