Very colorful and can be worn with so many different outfits. The material is very stretchy and seems to be of durable quality. In the sellers description these can be worn even by older girls and some women so I had to try one one to see for myself and surprisingly it was that stretchy. I could totally wear one if I wanted to but not for very long because wearing it did require the band to be stretched to its max and wasn't so comfortable after a while. I think they're a perfect band size for toddlers and even young girls to wear comfortably on their heads without it sliding off or being too tight. And for those questioning whether or not you can untie the ears, you can. The bunny ears are a separate piece of material that can be removed from the headband and tied back onto the headband but the headband itself can not be untied and adjusted for size. I Hope this seller makes more with different patterns and maybe some with an actual bow like the little girl in the picture has on hers.

The bows are large enough to fit me so I have no doubt the bows will last a few years as baby grows.

They are several patterns / colors to choose from so finding one to match a particular outfit is made easy. I was happy with the quality of these headbands once they arrived. Quality seems to vary widely when purchasing online, especially when manufactured over seas. Luckily these headbands are well made and the elastic is strong. These won't losen their hold after a couple uses like other brands I've tried. The only bad thing with these is there are a little too big for newborns. These likely won't fit well until about 6 months, maybe even 9 months old. I tried them on my 5 year old and they are workable but rather tight for her. So I'd say 6 months - 4 years is the likely recommended age. Either way these headbands are cute so even a little lose on a young one is good for pictures.\n\nDISCLOSURE*** I received this item/s for free (or heavily discounted) to give an honest and unbiased review...

On arrival they came in a sealed bag and then each headband was individually wrapped. The material is super soft and has a small elastic piece inside so they are somewhat stretchy. My little ones have trouble wearing some headbands as they are always a little snug, but these fit them perfectly! The rabbit ears are adjustable in size, you can actually take off that piece of cloth/ears, and adjust the size of the ears depending on how big of a knot you tie. Or another cute option is that you can take off the ears completely and just have a solid band, but there is a gathering of the material where the ears tie so you would have to flip it to the other side for a smooth band. However, I plan on using the little ears because they are precious and the colors are great, somewhat of a vintage and retro vibe. The styles that I received are as pictured.

The colors and patterns are vibrant and the craftsmanship on these turbans is superb. This set of turbans have a good variety of patterns for creating fun vintage looks. I may be bias but in my own opinion I think that my daughter looks undeniably gorgeous adorning these on her head.

The colors are pretty versatile and will pair well with most girls solid color onesies.\n\nOne thing to call out but it does not bother me that much is that in order to make the bow stiff they have a metal wire on one side of the inside of the bow. It should not cause any distress or discomfort to the baby but it is something to look out for and without it the bow would not keep it's shape.\n\nPlease note I did receive a discount to provide an honest review.", "summary": "Cute everyday headbands", "unixReviewTime": 1465171200}

The softness is important since it will provide comfort wear for my daughter. In addition, it's stretchable so it doesn't leave visible marked on head if its too small. It fits my daughter just fine now but once she grew a little I would just stretch it by pulling it so it stretch a little bigger before letting her wear it. The seam and stitching of the headband is smooth so when my daughter wears it on and takes it off it doesn't leave any marked around her head, some headbands stitching can be thick and leave a mark after wearing. I would say this headbands are for babies one year and up, it will be too big for newborns or even 6 months of age, you'd have to clip it or shorten it. It's very cute and my daughter received a lot of compliment while wearing it. I only wish that the package has more variety prints. Overall, these are really nice headbands.

I wear a size 10 or a L in normal high waisted skirts so I ordered up to the XL and I felt like I was wearing a child's skirt IF YOU ARE A LARGE OR XL LADY DO NOT BUY THIS.

The short sleeve shirts for this product are made of a stretchy spandex material which I am so happy about otherwise this shirt wouldn't have fit. Its tight and hugs you and I would probably never wear it with anything that didn't cover my tummy because thus shirt highlights all the rolls but its still a cute outfit and it's still going to work for what I bought it for.

It's extremely thin which is great because I was looking for something that wasn't going to make my purse bulky or something I could throw into a small crossbody bag but still have room for everything in it. The only problems (and they're small and easy to get over, which is why I gave it 4 stars)  is that on the little part you pull out there are two slots that look like they're made for SD cards (and my nook case has SD card slots which is why I figured that's what they were)  but when I tried to put SD cards in them they didn't fit. I don't know what else would go in these slots? My other problem was that when I took it out of the bag it smelled a little the way many new products smell (kind of like new leather boots would smell)  but after I left it out over night it went away. The last and final problem (and I leave this last because it may have been my fault)  the portion that pulls out has these black streaks on it like pulling it put actually damages that part of the wallet. I don't know if it was like that when I got it or if I maybe pulled it out too forcefully or something. I haven't had time to see if I'm able to clean it off yet but I was disappointed to have it for a few hours and it already be \"damaged\". Aside from those three miniscule problems (and one goes away,  and the other two are probably my fault)  I absolutely love it and I'm probably going to buy one in another color, or one of the other small ones this seller has with a similar look so I can switch them out and whatnot.

The reason I liked it is because it's great to wear over unbuttoned pants.  This product gave me comfort and confidence to wear my normal pants much further into pregnancy, reducing the amount of maternity clothes I needed to purchase (I was able to wear my regular pants into 22-24 weeks of pregnancy).  At first I tried putting it over my jeans and it rolled up.  I was happier with the product when I started to tuck half of it under my pants (over underwear) and fold it overtop of unbuttoned pants.  It will stay put better this way.  It may stick out past your shirt, but I still like the product because it just looks like you are layering a tank top underneath.  I definitely prefer this product with the silicon strip, as it helps it stay put better.  SIZING:  I recommend sizing up if you are in between sizes to prevent it from rolling.", "summary": "Good product, but get the one with the silicon strip", "unixReviewTime": 1461369600}

It fits quite well, but would not wear it the day after a big meal.  It is a great looking shirt for dance class; the large sleeves slim the waistline.

Very cute. I got several compliments. It looks great and sophisticated against tans and browns. Great pop. Doesn't look too cheap. It's not the most comfortable necklace I've ever worn in my life,  the hinges are a little jabby/scratchy but nothing debilitating. It didn't hang as low as I thought based on the mannequin photo but lord knows how big that pictured mannequin is. But I'm also not a scrawny woman myself nor have a tiny little neck.  It barely touches the first sign of cleavage on me. I like it. I ordered it in black, too.\n\nThey come from different places apparently,  one from America and one from Asia, even though they are from the 'same' seller. Thought that was noteworthy for anyone getting multiple colors thinking they'll get them at the same time or both in reasonable time. The turquoise arrived in about 5 days. Black says it's due January 20th (ordered like Dec 4th). Needless to say I'm happy with this based on what I paid. Nothing like cute jewelry to spice up plain but flattering tops that can take u from drab to stylish chic (that's my unconventional fashion preference, buy solid color plain flattering tops and then spend $50 on 15 to 20 different international costume jewelry pieces to put some flare on them and make it look like you know what you're doing and have a lot of combination ideas).... and at this price you'll never run out of cute necklaces to compliment plain stuff.\n\n12/22 The black and gold one I ordered that comes from a different place/country finally arrived. It's crinkled and I can't really get it to lay. Going to carefully attempt to hang it with tension or place something heavy on it (hopefully won't crank the beads, they're plastic). The color combination looks cheap together unfortunately. Not too cheap to wear if you don't work corporate of sorts but this color combo looks significantly less quality than the turquoise, like it actually looks like it's made out of plastic, which it is.

It has a ton of beads on it - small and medium - but won't weigh you down.\n\n The colors are more muted than the picture, but they fit in well with this season's colors. The part with the smaller bead consists of a majority of turquoise colored beads so that part gives you a mainly turquoise \"cool\" feel.  The larger beaded area consists of mainly \"hot\" colors - red, orange, maroon, and yellow. And it all goes together nicely!\n\n  It's quite well made and looks like it took a long time to construct. It looks a lot more expensive than the actual cost and could be worn nearly anywhere and with just about any color!\n\n  Be aware that it is a choker and not a \"beaded bib\" as the picture shows or the written description says.  It fits close up around your neck but you could add an extender if you don't like chokers.\n\n  The little bead earrings that came with it are the same size as the medium beads and are reddish and actually very nice and match the red in the necklace.\n\nThis is a funky and cool addition to any ones costume jewelry collection and I recommend it highly!", "summary": "Beautiful and Funky!", "unixReviewTime": 1432857600}

For a cheap $7 piece of jewelry it has far outlasted it's worth in price. After 14 months of regular wear I can say that some of the coloring on the beading - especially the beads that roll along my neck have began to fade or flake away - but even still the beauty of this thing prevails. It's a very interesting piece that gets tons of remarks. And it really matches with a lot of outfits. Sometimes I wear this cute little black top and it's just pops when I wear it. I'm not generally someone who seeks out attention - but when you wear this - it demands it. I tell everyone I got it from Amazon for less than $7!! And I have never had an issue with any of the strands of beads breaking. Now after a year of regular wear - if it does break - I'll be ok and just replace it. Hopefully they don't stop selling this piece because it's great. I totally recommend it. Best of luck!\n\nThis is so nice. I didn't think I'd like it but it definitely gets compliments and matches so many of my outfits! Even kids compliment it! Buy it! The only issue is it's a very short neckline.

That may just be me thinking that and it is doing that so DO NOT MAKE a Judgement on that - it is beautiful even blingless and you can DIY bling if it does flake!  For the price though, it is worth every penny, flakey or not.

I ended up not giving it away but I haven't worn it much so not sure how it holds up, I expect it to do well though since the metal parts are heavy, the clasp is really nice quality and the pendant itself is very heavy and solid feeling. It is really pretty, though the gems look pretty fake, but if they all fell out it would still be pretty (none of mine have fallen out though).

You could carry literally a whole college student's bank account in this wallet, it has like three 'hidden' pockets. My only letdown is that the card holders are very tight. Mind you you CAN fit one or two regular size credit cards in one sleeve, and it has 11, not counting the ID slot, but if you have punch cards or off size business cards they may be a weird fit in the horizontal sleeves(I had to trim my paper cards and voting registration). It was a bit disappointing finding this out because since you can really only fit a license in the ID slot, I had nowhere safe to keep my family photos. :C I threw them in a hidden pocket instead, they seem pretty secure. Good quality, doesn't appear to be taking on stains or falling apart at all living loose in my large purse. My clasp is working perfectly, though I saw someone else's had busted.

The thing I like best about this handbag is the handle.  What is interesting about the handle how it can be easily changed from a long over the shoulder strap to a handbag with two short handles.  This is very handy, I often find myself carrying my purses differently and I know I will use this option a lot.\n\nThe workmanship is on the inside of the bag is not perfect. The bag had quite a few loose threads on the inside which needed to be cut off because they were catching in zipped pocket. The outside stitching looks neat.  The two parts of the strap hook together a standard hook and look closure, my video includes a segment which shows threading the handle into the bag and closing it.\n\nHere are various measurements:\n 7.75\" wide x 5.5\" tall, sides expand to 2\"\n when handles are in short configuration they are 10\" long (measured from the purse center to the top of the loops)\n when handle is in the long configuration it is 20\" long (measured from the purse center to the top of the loop)\n The zipped pocket 5.5\" x 3\", it does not open wide, it will something like a set of keys\n\nOverall, this is pretty nice bag considering the $15 price tag (price +  shipping) as I am writing this review.\n\nThis bag is provided by HDE.\n\nAli Julia review", "summary": "Love the convertable handle", "unixReviewTime": 1409443200}

You can either put on hanger to air dry or put in the dryer on delicate setting w/air dry. I've done both before leaving a comment. The price was fair. It's not too light for me. I'm 5'6 + 36DD + 156 lbs., (weight fluctuates) and the robe is approximately two-three inches above my ankle. The robe is roomy, but not sloppy roomy. The pockets are deep and of course, pockets are always useful. I purchased size large.\nHope, I've given you information that you find helpful.", "summary": "The colors in a rainbow", "unixReviewTime": 1486771200}

The knife does indeed resemble a real kitchen knife, even having a black handle with a realistic tang and white dots painted on. The blade, unlike almost any other prop knife, actually is in the shape of a kitchen knife. The finish on the blade is pretty close to what is depicted in the photo, but mine has a bit less weathering. The dried blood looks great and the plastic is painted well enough to pass for metal at a glance. You can always repaint it if it's not to your liking. The only problem is that the plastic is thin which helps the look but also makes it flimsy and wobbly. If you accidentally stab something I fear the plastic might snap.\n\nOverall, 4/5, probably one of the best as-is knives you'll find for Halloween.\n\nEDIT: After using this with my Michael Myers costume for Halloween, I found out that it may look TOO good.

I immediately knew that any hopes I had that the medium size hoops may also work for me went out the window. They were too small for my taste. Nonetheless, I was happy to get a pair that I could wear after spending around $10. The curved stem of the Huggies is indeed a bit harder to put on than straight ones but itr wasn't too bad. My left ear piercing is a bit lower than the right one and a bit enlarged as well so the huggie doesn't hang as pretty as the right ear. I found the weight of the 16mm huggies to be quite satisfactory. The comfort with huggies is above most other styles of earrings. I don't like to switch out my jewelry on a daily basis. I also like to wear them in the shower, swimming, sleeping, talking on the phone, etc.  So, comfort is of utmost importance. These pass the test with the exception of swimming. I haven't done that yet. I hope someone who has worn them in the pool will let me know how they hold up.

These aren't exclusively for men. I found them while looking for sterling hoops and I'm glad I investigated them more.

While I do still love silver, there's always the pesky task of cleaning them when they tarnish. BEHOLD! No special care needed with these earrings. At least not yet that I've noticed. If, in the future I find that they do need some special maintenance, I'll edit my post.\n\nHere's what I love about these:\n1. Varying sizes. Want something understated? Go with the smallest size. Have more than one piercing in an ear? Add others!\n2. Easy to insert.\n3. Comfortable. Even while sleeping.\n4. Pretty secure. You don't feel like they could fall out unknowingly.\n5. Nice finish.\n6. Great price!\n\nWhat I don't love:\n1. I found that some of them clasp more tightly than others with an audible click. It seems like the holes or end ball aren't uniform. I am a little leery that one could come unclasped but it's not a huge concern because the whole earring would have to be severely jostled to come out of your ear. I don't know how much of a problem that would be for most people. I don't wrestle, play rugby, wear helmets or do any other activity where my head gets bashed around. And if I did, I'd probably forego earrings.\n\nOverall I'm very satisfied with these.

I had my ears pierced many years ago, and haven't worn earring for a few years, so getting my ears accustomed to having posts in them again has been a struggle. Sleeping with post earrings is a mess. Posts always poking into my neck. So huggies looked appealing due to the design of the post wrapping into the inside of the hoop. (Many don't offer this particular design, you have to put the post into a very small hole on the end of the hoop). Got these yesterday and put them on. Easy to put in, they are hinged, so you drop the back side down, slide in the post, lift the back up again until you hear a tiny \"click\" and done! No more painful post pokes! Slept in these without a problem. They are 9mm inside and 13 mm outside, and there is about 1/4\" from the inside of the hoop to my ear. I am earing both pairs together, silver on the bottom and the gold in the next hole. They look and feel awesome. They are stainless steel, so I don't anticipate any sensitivity to my ears. Great value too - two pair for less than the price of one!", "summary": "Great design- great value", "unixReviewTime": 1456358400}

I am trying to pull down the dress so the black sits right under my bra, no luck. if it did this dress would be a stunner. I love it overall however, and I'm sure I'm the only one that notices this.\n\nThe length is perfect, sits right above my knee. not \"old lady\" length at all. I love the fit so much, but maybe with a size bigger my booby issue would have been resolved??  the back detail.. idk what to call it.. the line that swoops down on top of my buns is awesome... it makes my little to nonexistent booty pop out and makes me more curvy looking.  It's not the thickest of materials, some may opt for a slip underneath as this has none. you can't see my bra through the white top though.

I am average height (by today's standards) but my legs are a little long and a tad hefty due to years of playing sports. In other words, I wear XL sized clothing made in America.\n\nUntil I bought these leg warmers I hadn't found any that would stay put or cover my knees, which is what I wanted them for. I have arthritis and my knees get very stiff and achy when cold.\n\nI rarely get dressed as I'm retired. Most of the time I just wear a sleep t-shirt (Jockey Women's Plus-Size Sleep Shirt) which don't cover my knees. I find my new cable knit leg warmers absolutely perfect to wear with my sleep shirts.\n\nI've read other reviews, of these leg warmers, that say they are scratchy and the elastic is tight or the leg warmers fall down. Don't be put off by these reviews.\n\nI have tissue-paper skin. I can feel a pea under 30 mattresses. When I first put the leg warmers on I found the elastic tight and they were scratchy. Fortunately, I was dead tired, and my knees were finally warm, so I went to sleep.\n\nBy morning my legs had grown used to the feel and the elastic fit great with the knee warmers right above my knees. I now wear a pair all the time.\n\nIn the ad photo, it shows the elastic side down around the ankles. If I wore them like that they would definitely fall down. However, if you want to wear them over pants you will probably have to have the elastic at the ankles. Warmth relaxes the elastic so wear them at a height, where the elastic is comfortable, until it relaxes to the point where you can raise the leg warmers higher on your legs.\n\nIf you find them scratchy, after wearing them a bit, you could always wash them by hand and add fabric softener to the rinse. I believe there is also a special product available to help make scratchy fabrics softer (it is meant for wool fabrics. I probably saw it in an Acorn catalog).\n\nI noticed that the Vermont Country Store also offers long leg warmers but at a significantly higher price with shipping, assuming you are a Prime member (believe me, it's worth every penny I pay for Prime). I have no idea how they compare to these, but the only thing that would make me order a pair would be a color I wanted to add to my collection.", "summary": "Fantastic Leg Warmers", "unixReviewTime": 1417651200}

The fabric feels quite soft and comfortable, not at all scratchy.\n\nIm not sure why the product title for this scarf says its an infinity scarf; you can see clearly from the product images that it is most definitely not an infinity scarf, but instead a regular, rectangular scarf.

Compared to the plain stuff found in American department stores this bra is a work of art (and it feels a lot more supportive). I washed it on the hand wash cycle in my machine and line dried it, there has been no bleeding of the fabric and nothing has come unstitched. There is only a very light factory smell which should come out in the next wash and is nothing compared to some of the hot topic bras I've purchased in which the smell never seems to go away. For functionality, it slims the back and is very supportive, I love that it has optional slide in push up support so that you can opt to or not to have it. The straps are thick which is another thing I really like because it adds to the comfort and support you get. It is a bit smaller than the usual sizing you would find in American stores so I would recommend ordering a size up (in circumference not cup) just in case. This bra is a bra I would feel comfortable wearing under a t-shirt and isn't just for decoration purposes. For the shipping, it didn't take too long to get here I was surprised at how fast the shipping was considering it's from a different country. I ordered the gold as well, there was no difference in sizing or stitching-it was of the same quality just a different color.", "summary": "Beautiful and Supportive", "unixReviewTime": 1421366400}

The first set I ordered were great, but I wanted another set more quickly and with prime it took more than 2 days to arrive, whereas Tai523 offered it with 2 day shipping for prime.  My items did arrive in 2 days, which was great.  The product is a good quality product but it is different from the ones I got from noonflower.  Both sellers have the same picture and I think the picture more accurately reflects Tai523's product.\n\n-Tai523's were darker in color and had an iron on images that are slightly different in color and size.  It was the same characters, just different colors/size.  The noonflower characters are painted onto the fabric.  I did like the noonflower designs and colors better.\n-The Tai523's have a terry cloth lining on the inside while the noonflower have the same cotton knit as on the outside lining the inside.\n-Both seem the same thickness and hold the same amount and both have the waterproof layer, so they work the same in that regard.  They keep poop contained and generally I see wetness around the leg holes and am able to change my son without any other mess. Sometimes I don't notice and the whole fabric gets wet, but I haven't had any sopping messes even when he had a big wet accident in the training pants.\n-The big difference is in the size of the leg holes.  The Tai523 leg holes are much bigger and stretchier than the noonflower.  I actually prefer the noonflower for my son as the leg hole is a better fit for him.  He is fairly skinny though.  He is 95% height and 50% weight.  At 34\" tall and 23lbs, the size 90 is a good size.  It does poof out a little in the back, but that is because he has a very tiny bottom.  The front fits well.\n\nBasically, these are great if you are potty training at home.  We are trying the montessori method and he's only 16 months old, so he is mostly wetting in these, but they are easy for him to change out of himself and if he poops they are easy to just dump into the toilet.  Although, it requires more frequent changing, I think it is easier than the prefolds and covers that we use regularly.  I think when he gets the hang of using the toilet more, these will be fine to wear going out of the house. He may still have accidents and need a change of underwear and pants, but I doubt he would make much of a mess.  If you are looking for something that fully contains like a diaper then these are not it.  But they do absorb a bit and keep you from getting too much of mess in the house. 4 stars because I like the designs of noonflower's better.  They are cuter and I think the paint will hold up better than the iron on.  I also liked the noonflower fit better for my kid, but your's may do better with Tai523's.", "summary": "I ordered these after ordering what looked like the identical product from another seller on amazon (noonflower)", "unixReviewTime": 1441584000}

Very delighted! It's pocket watch size (a bit bigger than a wristwatch).Nice solid feel and the chain looks like it will hold up. I like the fact that I can actually see the time without opening the cover. However, it is a bit easier to read that way. I wanted to be able to show the grand-kids, the pre-electronic wizardry that makes it work. Of course I can't verify that all of the wheels, levers and pulleys actually are functional... but it is impressive to look at!  I also like the fact it is self-winding. That allows me to interact with it and feel somewhat in control. I'm tempted to start wearing vests and dress shirts just so I can place it in my vest pocket. Oh, another factor for selecting this... as much as I like my wristwatch, I prefer to wear a nice looking bracelet instead, saving my wristwatch for more formal times.", "summary": "can't wait to show it to the grand-kids!", "unixReviewTime": 1417651200}

The color is made to look like that of polished brass but it is not. The watch feels much lighter than it looks and won't weigh you down if carrying on your person or in your pocket.\n\nA ring of Roman numerals are inscribed on the inner ring while the outer ring has a nice embellished floral design motif. The time is a little hard to read because the window is small (about the size of a dime) but you can pretty much figure it out by the way the hand points toward one of the Roman numerals. If you press down on the top knob, it opens and you can see it much better. It comes with a matching chain that has the same antique feel as the watch.\n\nThe windup mechanism is pretty cool because you don't often see windups these days (no reliance on batteries!) and there is a bigger picture window on the back through which you can more clearly see the gears moving around.  Very cool.\n\nIt's handsomely packaged in a brown box and the watch rests on a velvet cushion. Very classy and I always like how Mudder packages their products.\n\nOverall this is a very fun watch that is convincingly antique for not a lot of money.", "summary": "Antique-Style, Lightweight Watch With a Gilded Age Vibe", "unixReviewTime": 1460419200}

Fine, I thought. No big deal. I went back to the store and returned that one and bought another Flipeez Elsa hat.  Again, my daughter wore it only one day, and now the entire braid fell off! The rest of the hat is made beautifully -- very well-constructed, but that damned braid! The whole point of the hat is to have Elsa's braid move up and down. So, sadly, I am returning this one, too. Seems like there is a quality control problem because just by looking at the braid, you can see that there is only one piece of yarn that's supposed to hold the thing onto the rest of the hat. For the $20 I paid, I shouldn't have to sew pieces back together...especially not after only wearing for one day! My other daughter has the Flipeez dog hat, and that has lasted beautifully for over a year now. I'm returning the Elsa one and will look for another Flipeez design.\n\nI did include a video (sorry, no audio), so you can see how the hat works and how the braid fell cleanly off and was only attached by one string.", "summary": "One, two...three strikes you're out!", "unixReviewTime": 1417478400}

I found the wrap actually does not fit loosely as shown in the pic, which is what I wanted.  I think it would work well for someone who is very small, perhaps even average--say size 10-14.  Any larger than that don't waste the shipping time or money unless you're ok with it fitting a little more snug across the shoulders in front and back.  I must add as well, it takes a little practice and finesse to drape the thing on your body.  I'm a size 20 and it fit me more like a bolero than a cute little drapey scarf.\n\nIf you're ok with a less drapey look OR if you're a smaller person, this sweater scarf is actually quite nice and warm.

These bra's are way fun! They give you a bit more size on the bottom. Meaning they are a good push up bra. I've been told my boobs look bigger. How awesome is that! Great price for so many bra's! Received exactly as described & in a timely manner. Made pretty good for the cost. Comes packaged in a plastic bag so they are kept clean through shipping. Holds up well in the wash but I put mine in a wash bag & wash them in that. If you don't have one, I highly recommend you invest in one. They will save your bra's & lace underwear big time!\n\nCon's\nThe round piece that holds the strap to the cup is very flimsy & has broke on a couple straps. Not a big deal! I just sewed them back on & they look great. The sliders on the strap always slid back down to the cup. Does not let my straps be as tight as I like them. I also wish they were on my back not my front. They don't fall off my shoulders though so that's good. Just wish the sliders would stay where I put them. If I got an A cup this probably would not bother me so much. They are, how should I say, cuppy. I wear a 36B & they don't form to my breast right. I would suggest going down a cup size. They still look great on, they just have to much top cup room. So if you like to wear low V-Neck shirts & you bend over, everyone gets a boob shot because the bra holds the shirt off your chest but doesn't hold your boobs in the bra. Not ok!!! This is the worst part about these bra's!  But again, if I'd gone down a size it probably would not be a problem. Moving on... on the side's they are put together with an additional  seam that has a flexible hard something inside so that it doesn't curl up on you under your arm pit. I wear my white one the most & so it has the most wear. This spot has started turning into my side & drives me nuts! I no longer wear it because of this & am going to throw it out. Time for a new white bra. In other words they are around 4-5 month bra's with every day use. But really, for the price, that's not bad!\n\nSo there's my opinion... I really hope it helps. Would I buy these again? Probably. You can't beat the value. It's worth it. And the colors are awesome!

If you look like the model with slim shoulders and a modest bust, you've got a good shot at it. If you have broad shoulders OR are well-endowed in the bust area, it is NOT going to fit you. I got it for Christmas and this was my experience. From the bust down, the drape was lovely and flattering. From the bust up, it was so tight that it was uncomfortable.\n\n2. The garment is LOVELY! The material is soft and the design looks great in person (at least the red one I got). I was very disappointed it didn't fit.\n\n3.

I'm a Medium on most brands but I can fit into smalls too. So, I'm not overly big. But this top was tight around the chest and arms, and I felt like I'm bigger than what I thought I was, since I saw that this top fits people wearing XL comfortably, from the other reviews. And in the pic, it clearly shows a V neck whereas the one I received has a high scoop neck. That could also be the reason it's tight around my chest. I was hoping this would be like a special occasion top, given the fact that it costs over $22 but I couldn't imagine wearing it anywhere other than maybe to a local shopping trip, once I tried it on.

However, I'm keeping it because even though it's large-ish, the neckline isn't too big, deep, gaping. That's one thing I have a problem with is when I buy tops in a size large, often the neckline is so big, shows my undergarments, and just looks tacky.

Many reviewers have said that it's not too thick and not too thin -- and I'd add that the thickness is just right.  The fabric is some kind of knit, similar to what you might find on a sweatshirt.  The result is that it drapes pretty nicely and has some structure (if are trying to hide a muffin top or tummy rolls, this top would successfully do it), despite its flowy design.  I bought the khaki color and I like the color a lot.  I love how comfortable the top feels when I wear it.  But I returned it.  I think this top would look lovely on someone who has a slimmer torso and maybe a smaller chest.  I am a 38C with wide shoulders and slimmer hips (some might categorize me as an apple, but I think I'm a bit more pizza shaped) and when I wear this top I think I look like I'm putting on maternity wear or I could be a linebacker trying to appear delicate.

However, they are so absurdly small that they might only fit a panty size 9, equivalent to a dress size 14-16, with hips 45-46.5\". Worse, unlike most cotton jersey or interlock panties, the strangely stiff and scratchy fabric has little or no crosswise stretch. The crotch piece is about 1.5\" wide, which would hardly be wide enough for panties for an eight year old girl, much less the dimensions of a plus size woman. Nor is there enough length for a full cut panty. The manufacturers seem to think that as we get bigger, we do so only in width and not in length. They seem to think that large women have big backsides and completely flat tummies. The result is a supposedly full cut panty that is actually more like a tiny, wierdly fitting bikini with a waistband far south of the anatomical waist and inadequate coverage front and back.

However, it suffers from a couple issues:\n\n1) The rolled end links are too small for a watch (such as the Seiko 007) with fat spring bars. As mentioned by a previous reviewer, this issue is pretty easy to overcome by using the tines of a dinner fork to pry the rolled end links to fit the bars. The process took just a few minutes. However, I was left questioning the integrity of the rolled ends and concerned the spring bar might slip out at some point in the future.\n\n2) It's not comfortable. I was able to wear the strap for three days before I noticed chaffing on my wrist and had to take the watch off. I'm not looking to push through the pain and develop calluses on my wrist, so for me, this was a deal breaker.

They offer a lot of comfort and flexibility that you don't have from many metal link bracelets.

The 70's style added a bit of flash to the diver watch.\n\nI wanted to harness a little bit of that gaudy old school cool. I bought myself a Seiko SKX007. An inexpensive and classic diver. It had some vintage potential, but the stock rubber strap left a lot to be desired.\n\nEnter the shark mesh band. After installing it on the 007, it drips 70's style. It has less bulk than a metal link bracelet.\n\nFit and finish are excellent for a $10 band. To adjust the size, you need to pry up the flange on the inside of the clasp. You slide it to where you want it and clamp it back down.\n\nAs a warning, make sure you have the clasp hooked correctly, or you'll lose it. It doesn't have the second safety clasp over top. There's a set of hooks the hook over a bar and the cover clasp snaps over it. I have worn it running and lifting stuff and it has never unhooked.\n\nOverall a great way to put a heavy dose of 70's era style on your desk diver.
