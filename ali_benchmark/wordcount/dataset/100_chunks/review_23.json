I love lots of color, so this choice is perfect for me.  The colored stones are rather large, and the colors are very vivid.  There's a ring of round, bright turquoise stones on the inner edge,  then goldenrod yellow oval stones mixing it up with large fuschia rounds.  There are some clear rounds thrown in for extra sparkle, and a few metallic findings that enrich the overall look. This is a true collar-style necklace, and it fits me like an 18\" necklace, and that's using the extender.  Because of the construction, you won't be able to add more than about another inch because it won't lay correctly if you do.  If you like longer necklaces then this piece probably isn't for you.  But if you love fun jewelry, if you like to be the star, if you want all that delicious color up by your face....come on in, the water is fine!  This would be a great piece to wear to a block party, casual day at the office, or just to go to the grocery store.  It would be pretty on a jewel neckline sweater, or in an open collar of a shirt.  It would also be a great gift for the little diva in your life.  At this price, it's no big deal if it gets lost or broken.  The only 'flaw' for me is the way the clasp is attached.  There is very little room between the end of the necklace and the lobsterclaw clasp, so it's awkward to get a good enough grip to open it and latch it onto the chain.  Because of that, this is a four star rating.  But, it's great for what it is...playful, colorful, inexpensive, and showy.

They are well constructed and have held up well.

The top is a little baggy, but it still keeps the bust secure. There is a built-in bra--what you would find in a traditional spaghetti-strap tank--so it does keep your breast from getting pulled down or bouncing (gotta be real). The neck strap also helps with support, even though it is one size--meaning no adjustable buckle--but it fits nicely. The way the model is wearing the suit it exactly how it fit me, so the top comes down low enough to cover the mid-drift completely and meet the hip line.

They are so stinkin' cute, my favorite Tom's so far!

She is pushing Toddler size 9.5 and these are Toddler 9...as you can see from the pics, they have room to grow.\n\nIf you're like me and obsess for a ridiculous amount of time over the sizing....and if your child is in that awkward in-between-sizes phase, I would say you could really go either direction with sizing in Tom's.\n\nEven though the size we got has room to grow, we've gotten Tom's in the past a size up and though they did have a lot more room she was still able to wear them (without socks).\n\nIn fact they've always been her favorite so she wore them all the time, ran, played, walked long distances....all without complaining of her feet hurting and never blistering. The ones that we ordered a size up in lasted a LONG time.\n\nSo long story short, their sizing works great that If you go with their current size, or a bit smaller, they most likely will fit great...and possibly with room to grow!\n\nLast thing about these shoes, the pictures really don't do justice of how cute they are. They also have some silver threading that gives a little shimmer effect when it catches the light...nothing dramatic but a nice touch In the second picture I posted you can see it a little better", "summary": "Pics don't do justice...our favorite!!", "unixReviewTime": 1471478400}

Not sure they are worth the price (maybe at $20), but they are nice.  Only gripe would be the \"Saxx\" tag front and center is a little rough around the edges.  After the second wash, it seems to be less prickley around the edges though.  \"Saxx\" should just be stiched into the band, not a patch stitched onto the band.  I almost got the medium size since I'm a 34 waist, but happy I went with the large.  I think the medium size would have been tight since the underwear did shrink a bit.

If it wasn't for the quality control issue with the mesh panels and seams with this pair, they'd be almost perfect.\n\nAfter an estimated 30 wash&wear cycles, the mesh panels on either side of the guy bits are showing some pretty remarkable deterioration, compared to another pear of the same age.  The threads along the seams are starting to unravel, and many places on the mesh panels are now missing threads, looking like a runner in pantyhose.\n\nWill I buy the brand again?  Likely.

Beyond all that, the material is beginning to pill a little bit after only a few months of light use. I'm wholly unimpressed. If these weren't so expensive, I'd probably give them 3 stars. Given the premium price tag though, I can only give them 2 stars.\n\nWorth noting... I do like the Saxxx \"Kinetic\" line for running and other sports applications.

Passionately. Despise it. In fact, I've just avoided it completely since I was old enough to buy my own clothing when I moved out of my parents house. I've tried various brands. Various styles. Boxers. Boxer briefs. Briefs. You name it. I just hate it all. The reasons are numerous but irrelevant.\n\nI was coerced into trying a pair of these by a client of mine who sells them. He told me oh you just have to try them just try them I'm like ugh no I don't care how innovative they feel or look or ovepriced they appear to be. He had a Realtree pair in stock, and I said ok, I love Realtree so worst case I'll just have something else.\n\nI've been wearing this for a week now. I have worn them every day this week (yes, I've been washing them each night) because I am absolutely in love. In fact, yesterday I went back to my client's store and sheepishly admitted I wanted two more pairs. We laughed about it for awhile but I walked out a happy man.\n\nI really can't describe the level of innovation that these thing possess. They don't ride up, they are basically like wearing nothing at all. There are times when I forget I even have any equipment there. It's indescribably comfortable. I've even worn them to bed every night. Even with jeans on, they're comfortable as anything I have ever experienced. No more frank n beans sticking to things. No more discomfort or furniture rearranging when moving around.\n\nI'm curious how they last from a longevity standpoint. Viscose and spandex tend to be prone to pilling after awhile, and spandex is prone to breaking down over time and losing its elasticity. For $30, I expect a lot of life out of them - but that remains to be seen. So far, I'm beyond happy. For sizing, I'm a 33\" waist, 5'11\", and 195 lbs. I wear a size medium with no issue - so the size chart appears to be relatively accurate. They looked pretty tiny when I opened the package, but they fit fine. I have heard from the store personnel where I bought them to go up a size, but I stayed true to the size chart.", "summary": "Best underwear ever. Period.", "unixReviewTime": 1483056000}

I have a pair of Fiestas, two Platinum, two Kinetic briefs, a pro elite, and a vibe. I like the junk-holding mesh stuff, it's kinda nice. Here's a breakdown of my opinions on them all in the order that I bought them:\n\nVibe: They have the most style options. If you want to be looking fresh in your skivvies when you're getting down with the gal/guy of your choice, these ones are probably going to get you the most style points. HOWEVER, they are shorter than he rest, and maybe it's just my legs, but they ride up the most, so I won't be buying more.\n\nFiesta: These ones are cotton, so if that's what you dig, get em. However, the cotten will stretch out throughout the day, so you won't get that awesome 'tight' feeling after a few hours of wearing them. They may ride up a little, but nowhere near as much as the Vibes.\n\nPro Elite: I think these are my favorite. I mow grass and go to the gym a lot, so I appreciate the dry-fit-esque fabric down there when my fun bits start sweating. They won't stretch out throughout the day like the Fiestas, and they won't ride up like the Vibes.\n\nKinetic: I bought two pairs in a medium and am now thinking they should have been Large. More on that if I ever buy a large pair. Since they're briefs, riding up isn't even possible. they're by far the most breathable, and the first pair on my list to have a penis hole for when you're wearing dress pants and want to pee without untucking your shirt and fiddling with a belt and all that jazz. If I know it's going to be hot, I wear these to stave off the ever-threatening swamp nuts.\n\nPlatinum: If you want to wear the softest pair of underwear that have ever touched your body, and you want whoever touches you to feel the softest pair of underwear of their life, then these are the ones you want. I'm not sure if they make these out of kitten fur or what, but when I wear these I'm confident that my underwear is softer than every other man I pass that day, so if that's what you're going for, these are for you. BONUS: these ones also have a penis hole which is convenient.\n\nOverall I'd say... Pro Elite/Kinetic > Platinum > Fiesta > Vibe, but maybe that's just me. In the future I won't be buying more vibes, I'm unlikely to buy more Fiestas, I'm somewhat-likely to buy more Platinums, and I'm very-likely to buy more Pro Elite/Kinetics.", "summary": "I like the junk-holding mesh stuff", "unixReviewTime": 1472083200}

It's not a matter of waist size but rather how low the \"pouch\" is.\n\nUltra - Basically the same as the Platinum\n\nKinetic Brief - Tighter fit but really keeps everything in place.  Breathable\n\nKinetic Boxer - These are the perfect workout underwear.  Very breathable.  Legs stay down. Totally worth it.\n\nQuest - These are very low riders and sit well below your waist line but are still very snug.  Interesting material that dries very fast.  Probably could have sized up a size on these but now I wear them under my swim trucks because they dry super fast.\n\nUltra Brief - The most comfortable brief I've ever word.  Very stretchy so they are always comfortable.  Tight wear they need to be but plenty of room for everything that needs room.\n\nOverall, I've really liked my change over to Saxx.

Not a misprint or fluke as I was gifted a dozen pair and they all measure the same.  Being elastic it shouldn't be a problem and the waistband does stretch, but not as much as you'd think - there's something tight about SAXX elastic that makes is restrictive..  As a result, while I can easily get them on my size 33\" (GAP/BananaRep jeans & BrooksBrosGabardine) pants wearing waist (yes it's flat), while they feel comfortable for a while, eventually the waistband starts to roll over on itself in half, feeling more like a tight cord.  If I take my vanity out of caring about printed sizing, the waistband on a size XL measures 15\" across or 30\" around.  Waistband is more comfortable but now the brief has so much more fabric, requiring to pull up the briefs higher to get the proper lower crotch support, ending with the waist riding up almost below my ribs.  And yes I do have developed legs & a muscular butt so I'm not lacking in any body portions that normally fill out a pair of briefs, back or front.  Perfect design for a medium would be a XL waistband on a size medium fabric brief.\n\n#2 Fabric is (95%) Viscose, basically a version of rayon.  Very light & thin, it if were made in white almost sheer, pouch design itself is supportive.  Pros: your junk stays where it's suppose to, no sweating or heat even tho it's a manmade fabric, feels like you're going commando yet still supported, if it weren't for the overly tight waistband. Cons:  vicose/rayon can't take a lot of heat.  So as other reviewers have stated, they'll eventually melt & rip if you weekly throw them in the dryer with the rest of your cotton laundry.\n\nPersonal preference is Jockey's Microfiber Performance Boxer Brief (item # 8050):\n- 1/2 the price\n- 95% microfiber polyester (vs vicose) less susceptible to heat in dryer AND fabric itself is more supportive of your junk rather than requiring innovative sewn-in sling support\n- more proportionate sized waistband which stretches more & fabric itself more supportive, less shear, and .... like SAXX no sweating cuz you think it's a man made fabric.\n\nUnderwear for guys should not be this complicated, but with SAXX charging $30+ per pair, it has.  I just want to buy 12 pairs, not pick-n-choose what I grab out of the drawer every day, and know they'll last a year.  Jockey #8050 is a better 1/2 price option.

Ive had several years' experience with a few different styles of Saxx - Pro Elite, Vibe, and Fiesta. They are truly life changing underwear. I hand wash all my Saxx because I want them to last forever. For reference, Im 58 150 lbs, 31\" waist, and almost always wear size small in other underwear (CK, Champion, etc).\n\nPRO ELITE\nAmazing. I think these are the best all-purpose Saxx. As with all Saxx, the mesh panels work perfectly - brilliant invention. Ive searched far and wide for boxer briefs that are the right length to prevent chafing. 9 inseams (Champion, UA) prevent the thigh rubbing, but I find that the longer length rides *down* my legs instead of up, which pulls the material away from my junk, loses support, and leads to ball/thigh rubbing. Some 6 inseams still ride up because I like to hike them up a little to begin with to prevent ball chafing. Saxx to the rescue! These sit very naturally in the middle of the thigh and eliminate all chafing for me. Regular walking NEVER causes these to ride up. Ive worn these under jeans and shorts and they always stay in place. If you're doing lots of climbing or sitting Indian style they will probably ride up, but so would everything.\n\nThe polyester material stays super dry. They also smell WAY less than all the other polyester underwear Ive ever worn. These never seem to get that awful poly stink. Huge plus. These are perfect for casual hiking, great in the cold weather and also when its hot to keep you dry. They should last a long time.\n\nNote: the Pro Elites definitely run big! Size down, especially if you're in between sizes. I wear an XS in these. I tried the smalls and the mesh panels were too loose to provide consistent separation down there (especially when more active) and didn't give much support. When I tried the XS everything was perfect. The only downside of sizing down to the XS is that the waistband is pretty tight.\n\nVIBE\nThese are suuuuper comfortable, and also look great. Theyre modern fit and seem to run more true to size - I wear a small.\n\nBut the Vibes have a huge drawback. Without fail, the material loses its shape well within an hour. They will start to ride up and will not stop. It will only get worse as time goes on, especially if you're hot or sweating. I cant wear these for any kind of outdoor activity beyond a short walk with the dog. Losing their stretch will also lead to wedgies. By the end of the day, they're so loose that the mesh panels are no longer stretched sufficiently to stay in place. But if you don't care about these things these things, these might be your jam.\n\nFor me, the Vibes are perfect for around the house, lounging in pajamas, and even sleep. I wear them every night. They also show off your goods rather nicely. The viscose (modal) is very soft and feels amazing against your skin. I never want to take them off like I do synthetic underwear. They do fine in the washer, but I hang dry them because the dryer will cause the elastic waistband to wear out prematurely.\n\nFIESTA\nAlso amazing. Great for casual and everyday use. The mesh panels work perfectly and keep everything separated. The newer anti-roll striped waistband is a huge improvement. It feels very comfortable against my skin and does not roll. I haven't done anything super active in them, but for casual wear they barely/rarely stretch out or ride up. They stay drier than 100% cotton. Theyre maybe a half inch longer than the Pro Elites and provide plenty of chafing protection.\n\nThe Fiestas also run big. I wear an XS and they fit perfectly. Ive also noticed some inconsistencies in the Fiestas. They can vary slightly in length, rise, inseam, and mesh panels. Nothing major. I haven't had any of the 24/7s but they are the same material as the Fiestas.\n\nOther good places to buy Saxx are eBay, Backcountry, and Classic Shapewear. I personally have no problem spending $25-30 a pair because good fitting underwear is very important to me.

I finally found these and thought for the price, I will give them a try. So far they have kept their color after washing, they are softer than cotton yoga pants and hold up better than any other cotton brand I have purchased on Amazon or in stores for a similar price. As for fit, I am 5'7\" and usually buy size large pants, I bought the XL to insure I had extra length because I like them a little long.  It worked and they are a little long on me, they are tight around my butt but a there is a little extra material around my thighs but that's okay.  I prefer tighter but I will trade it for the longer length.  The stitching wasn't the best as one reviewer mentioned but they haven't come undone or anything. I heard a rip when I did my first few yoga moves in them but it doesn't seem to have compromised the pants yet.  If they start to unravel I will be sure to update this review.  I have purchased 3 pairs so far and really love them for the price. I would recommend these to anyone who loves bamboo yoga pants but doesn't want to pay the normal $100 price tag.

I ordered them because I wanted forms before the expensive (insurance covered) mastectomy bras and gel forms were available. I started wearing these about one month after surgery.

I can easily stuff these forms through the slits. The forms come with sticky strips, but they are not necessary with this type of bra. They hold their shape in soft bras unlike gel forms. They are very light and comfortable; I may never wear my gel forms. I am so happy with them that I ordered a second set so they can air dry after washing.\n\nThe size chart on the package (pictured in the product photos) seems accurate. I was a size 36B which equates to a size 5 form. I ordered size 4 forms because I wanted them a little smaller, and they are the right size for me. Note that this item is only one form; you must order two to have a set.\n\nSome people mentioned an odor. I noticed a slight foam smell for about 2 days after I removed them from the packaging.

I just want to carry a few things around with me, and this allows me to do that.\n\nThe wallet is, essentially, an elastic pocket. The whole thing stretches. When new, it holds the cards very securely; so much so the top strap is not even necessary when new. The key loop is pretty useless. It was pretty awkward with most keys; Too bad.\n\nSome things have changed since the original. 1) the strap over the top is available in colors other than red. There is some anti-slip stuff on the back of the strap over the top. 3) the loop to key loop is secured differently. The old loop was just a thick piece of cord.

I downsized my wallet to three licenses (driver license, pilot license and state bar card) plus four credit/debit cards, car key and house key plus some cash. Reward cards live on my phone or in my car. This is perfect for that load. It could hold a few more cards if needed but that would start to defeat the purpose. The material his very elastic and is tight whether you have one card or several like I do.\n\nYou can tuck your phone in it, but that makes the whole thing look a lot less minimalistic. Nevertheless, an S7 with protective case fits and I imagine the S7 edge or Note 7 would fit too, it would just look kind of ridiculous and would cease to be very minimalistic. Also with a large key fob, it doesn't work so well to tuck the key into the side but it makes the whole wallet fat and kind of defeats the purpose. However, the built-in keychain is a very, very good idea because your wallet and keys are always together and you're far less likely to misplace your keys.\n\nAt this price, you really can't go wrong IF you're committed to eliminating everything you don't absolutely have to have from your wallet.

When empty it's about the thickness of 2 credit cards. It feels decently made. It's obviously not the kind of quality you'll get out of a leather wallet, but for being made out of a stretchy fabric it felt nice. It's reasonably durable too. Other people must have gotten lemons, because I used mine every day for 2 months and the only problem with the wallet is the rubber strip on the inside of the band is coming off; it would be easily be fixed with some glue. It's convenience is about what you would expect from a wallet with 2 pockets. For some people, it might be hard to locate some of their cards if they have a lot of them. I only have about 7 so it was pretty manageable. The stretchiness of the wallet is helpful in that you are able to open the wallet up a bit to see your cards. The key loop is entirely useless. I put my keys on it for 2 days and it was absolutely dreadful. I would try and grab my keys and my wallet would be stuck in my pocket or vice versa. This is due in part to the fact that I wear very tight jeans, but I'd imagine it'd be inconveniencing for anyone. Any problems I had with the wallet were very minor, and I thought it was a great addition to the market of minimalist wallets for people that don't want to spend 100 dollars on a reinforced carbon fiber double RIFD titanium infused smart wallet or something of that sort. That said, I recently stopped using the wallet and switched back to my leather bifold wallet. In my opinion, the wallet, while being quite functional and handy, just looks a bit cheap.

When I need a card, I have to take everything out and shuffle to find what I need. What's worse, sometimes the clips fall out of my pocket because the my pocket is too shallow, who makes that a constant worry! The Crabby Wallet takes care of all that and then some. It's made of light, elastic fabric. It holds the cards I need, and let's me view them without removing them all. I can fold bills and tuck them in, with the band to wrap and secure it all. Because I'm so used to the bulge in my pocket, at first I was always patting my thighs to make sure I didn't lose things. The Crabby Wallet has the loop that can tether it, which is a lifesaver!

I've tried a few options instead of a traditional wallet: the metal card case, the money clip/card holder combo and just the ID case from a wallet. I like this one more than those options for a couple of reasons: it's impossibly compact yet holds a bunch of cards, the wide elastic strap keeps it all in place, and the small cord let's me keep a small wallet-sized external phone charger with my stuff without requiring a full wallet.\n\nSince my grown up life doesn't involve me taking clients to dinner or other scenarios where a dignified traditional wallet wouldn't undermine any confidence others have in me, I have no problem with the unusual look of the wallet. I've been using a fairly small plastic Batman wallet for about a year and it was impossible to use the individual card slots efficiently; I'm happy they offer a similar color motif. See photos for size comparison.\n\nI was worried that the small size and light weight would make me paranoid I didn't have it with me. Adding the external phone charger thing helps with that.\n\nUPDATE: I don't know where the lanyard went, but 2 years and 3 months later the wallet has held up great.

You can place all of your necessities inside this little wallet, leaving your purse in the overhead compartment and go purchase your things without having to rummage for your wallet to make a purchase. Little Crabby to the rescue! It fits right in the palm of your hand.\n\n  From your car, you may not want to bring your whole purse with you. You can place your cash or credit card inside the wallet, even though the wallet is smaller than the norm, that wide rubber band will hold your card down and the pressure from that and the card will hold your cash as well. On the inside of the wide band are strips of rubber, to grip the purse. No chance of it sliding off. There is a loop where you can slip your finger(s) through it for extra security. It will easily fit in your pockets.\n\n  I absolutely adore this little gem. I sometimes travel by train and this will hold my boarding ticket and any cash or card if I need it for purchasing special items.\n\n  *Crabby is lightweight\n\n  *Available in a variety of colors - ladies, you can match your other purse accessories\n\n  *Great use even for a pre-teen to use at school for purchasing lunch, vending machine items or items from the school store.\n  Some students now have to carry student ID cards to make purchases at their school so this would be perfect for them\n\n  *The only thing that I would like even more about this wallet...would be that the band would be located more in the middle of the\n  of the wallet than on the end. I feel that would make it even more secure. As of now, I feel like my cash would slip out....even\n  though it hasn't and probably wont.

I have had it for years and it's an earlier version of the current one. It was great at 3.5\" wide and a little over 4\" tall. It's still intact except for the leather decorative strip on the front that wore/cracked/dried out. I'd still use it, but it really looks horrible and my girlfriend has something to say about that. So, I ordered the Crabby Wallet. I have not used the first version, so I did not know what to expect with this one.\n\nThe first thing I did when I got it was take off the ring for keys. I wanted to use this as minimal as possible. It's small and I love it! It's not really a wallet though. It's more of a card holder. I put in 4 plastic cards and a few business cards and I am good to go. All in all, it is less than 2.5\" wide and almost 4\" high. Did I say I love it yet? Well, I do. I like to keep my wallet in my front pocket and appreciate that it is not bulky.\n\nI do not keep money in it, even folded. From one of a reviewer's pictures, they fold a bill and put it under the elastic strap. I can see myself pulling the elastic strap when getting a card out and dropping the cash. Most likely, in a situation when I am not paying attention and then I am out XXX number of dollars. No big deal. I keep my cash elsewhere.\n\nThe elastic strap does give me a secure feeling that the cards will not fall out, but it's a tight fit anyway, so it's just added protection. The one picture in the Seller's description that I saw when I can take advantage of the elastic strap is when strapping it to a cell phone. When flying, it's so much easier have the least number of items to take out of your pockets. I can connect my phone and this wallet and know I just have to pick up one less thing. It's small, but of big value to me. If you have a larger phone, especially with a case., it may be pushing it to try to get your phone under that strap.\n\nI would hope this lasts longer than my Eagle Creek, but time will tell. I will update this review accordingly. All in all, this is great if you don't use your wallet for additional storage and just for basic essentials. I recommend it highly!\n\nIf you have any questions about this product, just ask. Also, if this review was helpful in any way, please click \"Yes\" to \"Was this review helpful to you?\" below.

This wallet performed so well that it is now my everyday carry wallet at home.  I started my trip with just six currency bills under the elastic strap, but after getting change from my first cash purchase, I was suddenly carrying twice the number of bills.  The currency must be folded into fourths to fit under the elastic, which means the wad of bills is pretty thick with all those folds.  Given this situation, it was much easier for the bills to catch onto pants or pouch material as it was removed.  When this happened, the elastic band will actually help shove the currency away from the wallet once it gets past a certain point.  Not an ideal situation if you're in a hurry as you may have your attention elsewhere and not notice.

I had about 10 cards stuffed in the large pocket, and I'd say this will comfortably fit about 12 cards.

Even with this many cards loaded in, the wallet is still really thin and feels great in the pocket. Not everything is perfect with this wallet though. It was immediately clear after a couple of weeks of use that this fabric won't hold up long term. After a month and a half the strap already felt a bit loose. Also I really don't like the big red crab logo or red text with the Crabby Wallet name (the color of this text changes with other color bands but everyone gets the red crab).

I have been an owner of a Crabby Wallet since the original Kickstarter. Many people use it as a small wallet for travel, biking, or going to the gym. I use mine all the time. It is small enough to fit in my front pocket without being uncomfortable and is so light and slim that I hardly notice it. It has enough room for me to easily keep 3 credit cards, a driver's license, other ID, and 5-10 bills with room to spare. You could fit double that if you wanted, but my whole goal in moving to a minimalist wallet was to get rid of all the extra junk I carried around for no reason.\n\nThe elastic band keeps items secure inside the wallet. I never worry about things falling out. I do not personally use the lobster claw keychain, but my daughter uses hers for her car keys and has not had any problems with it. I have owned my V2 for about 6 months, and with daily use as my primary wallet it shows no signs of wear.\n\nThe V2 wallet fixed a few of the minor issues people experienced in the original. The original version was slightly smaller so cards were a tighter fit and some people had issues with durability, particularly with the elastic band. I did not experience problems with my original after a year of dailyuse, but I upgraded to the V2 because it is a better design and I passed my V1 on to one of my kids.", "summary": "Perfect Minimalist Wallet", "unixReviewTime": 1438905600}

But because of the Crabby wallet's big elastic band and the wallet's ability to expand according to its contents, I am able to bring along anything I want. I can jam in a few cards (driver's license, bank card, school ID, credit card, library card), fold up some cash and stick it in, and attach my iPhone with the band.

I'm liking this wallet more and more as I use it. I am coming from a leather bifold that was getting quite bulky. I've had to ditch my pack rat mentality which is necessary with this wallet.\n\nIt has one \"outside\" pocket that snugly fits 1-2 cards. I use it solely for the one credit card I use the most. Doing so, it allows me quick access and FAST deployment of my card. Since I store only one card in the outer pocket, there's no chance of taking out the wrong card or dropping other ones. I think this is what the creators intended.\n\nThe larger main pocket snugly holds my stack of about 8 cards. My strategy here is to place my next most commonly used cards at the top and bottom of the stack. In this way, I can easily and reliably access my driver's license and Costco card quickly as well. Knowing what cards are first and last in the stack allows me to take them out quickly without hunting. My less commonly used cards are actually towards the middle of the stack.\n\nNow for cash what I've done is fold the bills in half and then half once more. Then what I do is insert one half of the \"v\" into the main pocket against my last card. (See my photos.) Doing so allows me to store and take out cash in a simple and reliable way. The elastic band the fits nicely around the contents of my wallet. Since the cash is fold in half twice, the bills don't get too beat up and fit sleekly in the wallet.\n\nIn summary, I think this is a really smart design for a minimalistic wallet. It's sleek, fast and straight forward. At first I thought the elastic loop was cumbersome but it does give you  piece of mind knowing that it'll ensure your contents stay in the wallet. For all you packrats out there thinking about slimming down your wallet, give this one a shot!\n\n Lastly, I purchased this wallet at a discounted rate for an honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Crabby Wallet works like a charm!", "unixReviewTime": 1431820800}

I've had a few slim front-pocket wallets in the past, but none have been as easy to adapt to as the Crabby Wallet. This wallet is very thin, lightweight, yet it still has two pockets and an elastic band that can hold additional items inside the wallet.\n\nPros:\n - Thin and lightweight\n - Multiple colors available\n - Holds plenty of cards (I carry at least 14 cards in my Crabby Wallet every day)\n - No butt-bulge from overstuffed wallets\n - No more lower back pain from sitting on a thick wallet\nCons:\n - The keychain is a bit useless to me. My car key is a flip-type key, so it won't fit, and I carry multiple keys on my regular key chain (house, office, cabinets, etc). I don't have just one key that would be fine to place with my Crabby Wallet. I ended up taking off the keychain and tossing it in the garbage.\n - Elastic tends to fray from time to time. A quick snip with scissors keeps the fraying from spreading.\n\nThe pictures I have added are of my wallet being 3 months old. I've since purchased a second Crabby Wallet for my partner as he likes how I never have a large bulge in my back pocket, nor do I complain of back pain from sitting on a thick wallet every day.\n\nNote: This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.", "summary": "Back pain relieved - Less likely to bulk up with unnecessary cards and receipts", "unixReviewTime": 1431561600}

It's a little inconvenient to carry cash with this wallet, but it gets the job done and I haven't had any bills fall out. I don't carry cash much anyway.\n\nI've had the wallet for 2 months now, and it's starting to show some wear and tear. The rubber strip inside the elastic band is coming off. This doesn't seem to affect the wallet at all though, everything is still secure. What I am more concerned about is the stitching came undone around the top of the outer lining of the back pocket, and now the elastic band which holds the pocket tight against the cards is separated from the fabric, which is now noticeably loose. The wallet still holds everything thanks to the colored elastic band, but it concerns me that it's coming apart after only two months, which is why I didn't leave 4 stars. Apart from those problems this is a great minimalist wallet, maybe I just got one with some bad stitching, I'm considering buying another to replace it.", "summary": "Apart from those problems this is a great minimalist wallet", "unixReviewTime": 1429142400}

I'm one of those guys who has carried a bifold wallet in my back pocket since forever.  However, I've definitely wanted something a bit more compact for quite some time as I almost exclusively use credit cards to pay for things these days.  I found other solutions, like money clips, to be too flashy, had no place to hide \"emergency cash\", and/or having a propensity to scratch up my credit cards.\n\nI saw this item on Kickstarter quite some time ago and it caught my interest; but then in the rush of life just forgot about it until I happened upon it while browsing Amazon.  I immediately purchased and have been thoroughly satisfied!  I carry around 10 plastic cards (credit cards, driver's license, state bar membership card, etc.), a couple dollar bills, and one \"emergency\" bill.  Everything I need fits into the Crabby Wallet with minimal bulk!  The band keeps everything secure and having the ability to quickly attach my car key to the wallet make sure I don't lose anything.\n\nWhile finding the card I'm looking for may take a bit more time than in a traditional wallet, the \"quick access\" pocket is convenient for my two main go-to cards.  The only way I might see improving the product is to add a \"quick access\" pocket to the opposite side of the product as well, but certainly that's just a personal thought which would likely increase the bulk of the product and not be desirable for everyone.  Even if your preference is to maintain a larger wallet, something like this is perfect for traveling, when you need to have means for payment but want to minimize bulk.  This is certainly an improvement on the double-looped rubber band solution I've typically used in those instances.\n\nI'd highly recommend the product (and have already done so).  The quality of the item's construction equals the innovative nature of the concept and the reasonable price makes it a no-brainer deal.  That's something that certainly can't be said of many things these days.", "summary": "Fantastic product, from concept to execution!", "unixReviewTime": 1424822400}

I've been looking to transition from my back pocket to my front pocket for a while now due to comfort issues and because my cards eventually start bending which then causes them not to work in some card readers. After reading reviews and looking at the Kickstarter it looks like version 2 is a huge improvement over the first and I will say the build quality is great. I have been carrying it for over a week now and haven't had any issues at all. It took some getting used to as I have used a bi-fold wallet for several years but I love how slim it is. The only thing I am having an issue with is where exactly to keep cash. If you fold it in half then it fits lengthwise but is taller than the cards so it mashes it down. If you fold it into quarters and put it in sideways it fits but kind of gets lost down in the wallet and is difficult to get out. I'm not taking any stars away because I know this is geared toward use with cards and I'm not one who typically has cash either but it does happen from time to time because there still are dinosaurs around my town that don't accept cards. I have just been folding it into quarters and sticking it under the elastic band on the outside. It works but I fear if I don't pay attention then I may drop it one day. I think adding another short pocket on the back for cash use wouldn't add any bulk and make it a little safer as well as more convenient to get in and out of the wallet. Regardless, it is still a great product and I look forward to any future versions that may come along. I will also note that the orange is slightly darker than the stock photo here on Amazon.

I was fairly skeptical of these hats, because the reviews just seemed *too* good, but they truly are soft, thick, warm and cute. I am a woman and have a medium-large sized head and felt like the hat was a good fit for me.\n\nThe main reason I'm leaving a review is to say that the tacky square, brown \"C.C.\" tag is super easy to remove and doesn't leave any holes or sign of having been there. I used my husbands pocket knife to cut the thread and it came off without a snag. The picture I added is showing the slight indentation left in the fibers from the tag - like carpet fluffs back up when you move furniture around, the fibers of the hat will fluff back up. Don't let the ugly tag keep you from buying, these hats are great bang for your buck.

The material (as pictured) is a nice bronze-gold, and doesn't feel too cheap, not like it will rub off immediately. I love that the chain is a bit thicker than usual, and therefore the \"lobster claw\" closure is also quite large, making it super easy to handle - no more fumbling to undo your necklace! This would be great if (like me) you struggle with tiny, dainty jewelry clasps.\n\nThe charm is clearly printed on the front with the adorable hedgehog design, while the back side is plain textured metal. While wearing it around for a couple of hours, I didn't notice any flipping - the weighting seems solid enough to prevent this - so the unprinted backside shouldn't be a problem.\n\nAs a bonus, the necklace came with a cute drawstring \"Jane Stone\" pouch, perfect for gifting, storing, or stashing other small jewelry items.\n\nMy only criticism (if any) is that you cannot adjust the length of this necklace - it only has one large ring for the claw closure, no extender - but the pendant sits at a nice position anyway so this is not a major issue. (See photos for a length on me.) The hedgie does hang rather close to my cleavage, however, which is not ideal for more modest dressing styles. This necklace would probably look best with either a low-cut or high-cut neckline - \"in between\" would cause the pendant to get jumbled up with your shirt.\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.

This necklace appeared to be fairly priced. It arrived on time through Amazon Prime and is pretty close to what I expected.\n\nThe charm and the chain are made of a golden, bronzy metal. The charm is a bit hefty, so the chain is not dainty. I will consider re-stringing the necklace with a thinner but durable chain to increase the overall aesthetic of the necklace. Its not that I dislike the chain, its just that I think another chain would be better for me personally if I were to wear this often. A slimmer chain would be more sleek and draw attention to the hedgehog charm better.\n\nThe charm is reasonably well made, for the price. The front has the hedgehog details whereas the back does not, as you can see in the photos I included. I like this, however, and when you wear the necklace as long as the hedgehog side is facing out the pendant does not flip around on your chest and hangs true. The charm is slightly convex so that the hedgehog pops out and looks more three-dimensional.\n\nI must comment on how adorably the item is packaged, as well. The necklace came well protected in bubble wrap with a cute Thank You sticker affixed to the top. It also came with a nice sachet in which you can store the necklace, other necklaces, or use as part of your gift wrapping. I intend to give this item away as a gift, so the bonus of the sachet is really nice.\n\nIf you receive the item and decide you do not like to wear it, the hedgehog charm could definitely be repurposed. I thought about converting him into a cell phone charm or adding him to a keychain. I do believe the charm is durable enough to be affixed to a cell phone or keychain, which would definitely put more stress on the metal than simply wearing it as a necklace.\n\nBottom line: This is a reasonably priced, cute necklace that is worthwhile for someone who would really like the hedgehog charm. It comes packaged well and would make a great gift.\n\nI received this item at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest review.

And the actual pendant does hang like it does in the picture, which you may notice, is upside down.  (The lightning bolt scar that Harry Potter has is not on his cheek under his glasses, but rather on his fore head ABOVE his glasses)  You can flip it up the right way and it will hold there for a little while, but moving around will cause it to flip back upside down like it is in the main picture.

It's whimsical and unusual. I like that all scull pieces are different, depending on their position in the necklace, i.e., there are front view and side view, and left and right view pieces - exciting! The little crystals (purple, in my case), in combination with gold, give a nice mysterious sheen, not overpowering. Even though I like the theme, I wouldn't probably wear it as an everyday necklace - there has to be a special occasion for it, like a costume party or some special dance night, or, I don't know, a movie maybe. Also, it's quite heavy visually (not so much physically), so I'd make sure it's a centerpiece of my outfit. In other words, it's a nice surprise piece to have in my jewelry collection.\n\nThis is my honest review in exchange for the discounted price I got for this necklace.", "summary": "I love it!

My daughter was with me when I unwrapped it. We looked at each other & agreed it's much better quality than we expected.\n\nIt arrived a week earlier than the estimated delivery date, which was a nice surprise. So it took about three weeks total from the date I ordered to arrive.\n\nI had ordered three separate pieces on the same day from this same seller, Pearl Plus, paying shipping X3 and so I contacted them and asked if they could combine shipping and to my surprise, they obliged very happily and refunded my account for shipping X2. They replied very promptly and very courteously to my email. I'm very pleased with their customer service.\n\nNow, as for the necklace, itself, it is a bib necklace with three rows of 23 cascading rhinestone encrusted skulls. And one skull hangs from the back of the necklace as shown in the picture when you order. I chose to order the purple rhinestone with gold hardware. Silver was not an option for me at the time, but I will be purchasing this necklace in silver.\n\nIt's a really beautiful piece, much more so in person. The pictures don't quite capture the sparkle. If you love all that glitters, or looking for the perfect gift for that special Libra in your life, look no further. She'll love it.\n\nThis product was offered to me at a discount in exchange for my honest review.", "summary": "The pictures do not do this necklace Justice.

I have bought many \"Cheaters\" from Drug Stores, but it seemed like they were always at my desk, in my car, or in my computer bag when I needed them most. I wanted something I could keep with my phone since my phone is always with me (demands of my job).\n\nSelection Process - There are other small cheaters available, but I liked what I saw in therms of a case and holder. I was worried about some of the reviews, but wanted to give a small company a chance to earn my loyalty. So far they have and I have found most of the negative things said not to be true.\n\nOut of the Box - Everything was there and in good condition. There was a paper included that offered a lifetime warranty in exchange for web registration. I made immediate use of this since I am known to loose these forms or forget to register.\n\nRegistration - Fast and easy. I registered online an month ago and, to date, no spam mail from the company or anyone else (as far as I can tell).\n\nAssembly - The included case stuck, and has remained stuck, to the back of my Otter Box  for a month now. Install was easy. If you can use a Post-It Note, you can do this.\n\nUse - After a month, I can not complain. I have used it a lot and can see no damage or other quality issue so far! I read reviews on breaking quickly, but that has not been my experience.\n\nStyle - What style? This is why I would deduct a 1/2 Star. My kids love to tease me about them, calling me \"Gram-pa Joe\" (even though my name is not Joe). But they are not designed for the fashion parade, they are for short time use.\n\nComfort and Fit - I am tall and my nose is proportional to my body and face. I am not fat, but I am a big guy at 6'4\". Since you need a nose to grip on for use, my nose structure has been optimal for use with this product. I would imagine that different noses would have different experiences. The nose bridge is made of a grippy material with a rough feel. This has not bothered me, but I did notice it the first few uses. Again, since I am using them for short term use, not reading a novel, the sandpaper feel was not an issue.\n\nUse - They have worked great for me for short term use. I mostly use them to check emails or order from a menu. For these uses, it has been a good product.\n\nWarranty - Lifetime free replacement. Hard to beat that!!!\n\nRecommendation - I would recommend these as a second pair of cheaters for short term use.", "summary": "Excellent Solution to \"Forgetting\" your Glasses", "unixReviewTime": 1473379200}

They fit more comfortably than my Rx glasses and are easy to find.\nI'm going to check out the knockoffs. I don't mind paying cheap prices for throw away and they can't be worse than these in quality.\n\nUPDATE: I purchased the \"Smartphone\" brand of glasses and they fit in the Thinoptics case. They don't fit your face as well (refuse to fit on the bridge of your nose, so when you wear them you sound like you have a cold lol) but they work and the cost was 1/3.\nThinoptics got back to me after a week and offered to ship out a new pair. I got them a week later (glasses only) and they've lasted past a day of use! I guess if the company keeps sending me a new pair every time they break it will be worth investing in the initial pair.

And the case is so thin and light that it is worth it. Sure you can put them in a regular eye glass case but wouldn't that moot the point of having something like this to be easily carried? The glasses are really thin and  flexible and they squeeze into the case. The case measures 3 1/4 L, 2 W, 3/16 D and made of hard plastic in case you want to mount it to the back of your cellphone. You can either leave the case as is or stick it to the back of your cellphone with an adhesive strip that is provided. Surface shouldn't be silicone, rubber or textured. Pretty much covers most phones out there with cases. Might have to purchase some other compatible double sided tape to make it work if you wanted to mount it.\n\nThe glasses measure 4 5/16 from end to end and 4 1/2 inches fully opened. And each individual lens measures 1 x 1 3/4 inches. There is no front or back so either side works. There is no one sweet spot on the lens so the whole lens is functional. My head is on the bigger side and the lenses line up pretty good for me. The nose pads are rough like sandpaper to provide grip. You wear it for a while you will feel it a little but not bad. You are supposed to grip each lens and place it on your nose instead of pushing it down on the middle of the glasses. The fit and placement will vary with each user based on the shape of the shape and size of their nose bridge. Some may be able to sit it higher up on their nose where it is the most efficient where others it may only work lower on the nose where the bridge meets where the bulge of the nostrils start. If it sits lower then you will have to move your head up and down more or have your head held up higher depending on the level of the object you are looking at. Also if you have an oily face, it will affect how it stays on also, so wipe the bridge of your nose first helps. I would still use my regular reading glasses at home because I can just slide them down out of the way and walk around rather than removing these and placing them back on my nose every time I wanted to get up for something. And I wouldn't wear them to do something where I am constantly moving my head or where they can drop down let's say the engine compartment of my car while I was working on an engine. So great for sitting or lounging around but not for being active.\n\nThey work great and now I will carry them when I go out and able to see the menu or something. I never carried my regular reading glasses when I go out because it would be too bulky with a case. And for a female that carries a tiny purse, this is a space saver.  I wanted to give it 4 stars because I wished the nose pads would have a better fit so it could fit higher up on my nose but it's still pretty good and I can't fault them for that. If you have a flat nose then these may not work for you.", "summary": "I CAN SEE!", "unixReviewTime": 1444262400}

I am 5'7\" and very leggy and this jumpsuit makes my legs look longer than they even are. The material felt very comfortable as I was able to walk around in this Jumpsuit for hors without any concerns or problems. Although a V is shown in the picture my dress is rounded off, which I prefer because now I do not have to worry about falling out if the V was too deep. A normal bra and panties can be worn with this out, but the outfit is not see through at all, in fact, the material is a good weight. The Jumpsuit really hugs the backside and even provides a bit of lift to the buttocks. Although not cheeky, the jumpsuit does ride up slightly after walking for a period of time, which puts the bottom of the jumpsuit right at your buttocks.

Very very true to size, the size menu dropped me in the medium category; I purchased a medium & it fit just right, although the bottoms were just a TAD bit loose but it's okay because I have the bottom for it, I actually like the extra room in them, they don't sag but they are not so tight which is perfectly comfortable for me.\n\nCOLOR: I have been seeing many customers give bad rates for color, saying it's grey instead of black. WHICH IS NOT TRUE. It is indeed black but if stretched it will look as though it is grey. People who have ordered the outfit & had it turn out grey ordered a size too small, when they should have ordered a size up for their original size.\n\nI am a model & just so happen to be at home alone the day I received the package that explains why the picture on the right was very blurry, my lens would not focus because I had to set a timer. So I sharpened it as high as the editor would let me to strengthen the outlines of my figure for you all to see how well the clothes fit me. The loose part I was referring to earlier is visible, you can kind of see below my belly button it looks loose but as I mentioned before, it didn't bother me.\n\nSHIPPING: I was expecting to get it by the end of may but it only took TWO WEEKS to arrive!!! Awesome shipping! I was very stunned, pleased & at ease because I was leaving for NYC, ATL & Alabama on 4/29/2015, I would have not been back for awhile.

Also watch out 'cause they come flying up at you instead of down like other punches.  I used an old credit card and some rewards cards I never used, managing to get 6 stays out of each.  The edges are just a hair rough but can either be filed with a fingernail file or left as-is.  They weren't rough enough to cut the material on the shirts so no worries about leaving as-is but I'm also not using delicate materials like silk or have expensive shirts.  Then again, if I were willing to put forward the money for expensive shirts I'd get expensive stays.\n\nIn the future I'd love to see some punch cards sized for this like they do for the pick punch.  I know I can use those but they're sized wrong so I'd have to go lengthwise and that just makes me cringe.  Still, if you lose or need collar stays, don't get new ones.

I work in a restaurant and recycle hundreds of used gift cards each month. I was really excited to have something other than guitar picks to make, but the design of this is so bad.\nIt pops the stays out the top, and for me it jams a lot more since its fighting gravity and I get a messed up piece. But the worst part is the puncher has a HARD EDGE right in the middle of it. About 1/4 of the stays I've punched have broken in half at that point. ALL of them have a slight crease there.  Why would they make that there?  Every other punch has a smooth curve.  It's still totally usable.  You can bend the stays back and they'll be fine.  For someone like me who uses them for crafts, having them all bent is a deal breaker.\nI'm going to contact them now in case I somehow received a defective model, but I'm pretty sure it's just the design.\n\nUPDATE:  Yup!  As an eager early adopter, I got an early model.  It has since been fixed.  GREAT customer service.  They sent me a replacement after a pleasant conversation about it.

The seam doesn't look thick enough to cut and divide in two. In the case of my wallet I had a flap with insert over the slot where I wanted to put this in, so I simply stuck one side of the insert in the pocket and the other side I trimmed slightly to slide into the flap covering it and then creased it down the center to try and get it to lay flat. It bulges just a little but not bad and seems to work. Makes for a fat wallet, but I had a lot of cards in there. The plastic does seem to be of good quality and design, certainly thicker than what I had in there and have been using for several years now. The pockets aren't super tight either so I believe I can get cards in and out without tearing the pockets and I do believe one pocket would hold two cards.

It was very soft and loose but still offered just a little support. I wished I had a bunch more!\n\n3)cute look\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n\n1) I wished the bag was a baby hat or headband. Didnt use the bag and don't see any use for it.\n2) semi-expensive", "summary": "I really liked this set", "unixReviewTime": 1512172800}

The sleeveless top is a bit large, but I'm happy that its a bit blouse-y right now, because I've still got a bit of baby weight!  It does work very well for nursing.

(it doesn't leave much to the imagination)\nThe pants are great- even if you've had a c-section.

Everyone will tell you to wear nightgowns/dresses, etc post surgery and not to wear pants- but my legs get cold!

Also, one arm on the robe also has loose stitching where it just let go. So now, one arm hangs lower than the other and it bothers me. For the price, I'd expect better quality and really bummed. The tank will not work out for nursing as it just won't hold anything up.", "summary": "Stitching isn't holding up", "unixReviewTime": 1477785600}

Great that it is open on the bottom making the 10-12 daily diaper changes within the first couple weeks easy.  The material is great and pretty forgiving.  Nice for visits when guests stop by.  My only issue with this pajama is with the top.  If you use this while breastfeeding and try to use it by pulling the cups down so that you can feed your baby, they get very stretched out and sag down afterward.  It would be better if there was a nursing flap of some sort to avoid that from happening and at the price point of this product, I would almost expect it.  You can get nursing pajama sets with the nursing clip down cups at the mall maternity stores for the same or lower cost.  The fabric isn't as comfy as these, but what good is it if the top is so stretched out that you don't want to wear it after a few uses?  Would imagine these would be great during pregnancy though.  I bought them for after the baby arrived.  I bought a small and it was a little big for me after two weeks post delivery.

When I found this I knew I had to get it. (Even if that meant being judged by other parents). The second I put it on him and saw him crawling around the house, it gave me peace of mind knowing that if he fell, it wouldn't be such a bad hit to his head and I was glad that I didn't have to hover over him constantly whenever he was pulling himself up on the furniture. I also couldn't stop laughing when I put it on him!! (It's pretty goofy looking, but that's what makes it so cute! Lol) When I first put it on he wanted to take it right off (like he does with any hat I put on his head) but once he was crawling all around and pulling himself up, he forgot it was on his head. The only reason I'm rating 4 stars instead of 5 is because I'm not a huge fan of the string ties. When I tied them together under his chin he easily pulled the bow apart. I just ended up tying them together behind his head to keep them out of the way. It would probably be better if it was an adjustable buckle instead of just strings. But overall, besides that, it's great! It's super soft and size adjustable with velcro to fit all babies. Another nice thing is that the top isn't closed in completely, which allows baby's head to breathe. And it covers front and back of head as well as the sides. It's probably the closest thing we'll get to putting our babies in a bubble!

The buttons do unbutton and re-button so there was no problem getting in on. I really hate to say this, but it does look poorly made.

First ,when you put it on ,the inside of the cape has the STRONG ODOR OF FISH.  I have a sensitive sense of smell and BA BOOM, did it hit me. I have noticed this smell on other clothes  walking through a department store, so I am sure this is some sort of spray or something.  It just made my stomach turn. I will just have to hold my breath when I put it on.  Another negative is some of the buttons are loose. No big deal.  I can handle that. I still think the cape is worth buying and give it two thumbs up.  Wish it did not have that smell, though.  I still RECOMMEND the cape.  You WILL get compliments, ladies. The highest of fashion.

For $16 one should not expect much, but I have never made an online purchase that was so deceptive or disappointing as this coat. You will smell this poncho before you see it. It bears a discomforting odor that led me to suspect that the item was used or previously stored in a kennel.\n\nThe buttons were crooked and 2 fell off once touched. The button holes were still stitched close, so a razor blade was necessary to cut them open. The hem was roughly sewn and loose threads were hanging off. A scissors was needed to trim them.  One sleeve is bigger and longer than the other. It may be required to surgically shorten your arms for a proper fit.\n\nThe most laughable part of this entire purchase is when you finally put on the poncho. It was lopsided, lean, crooked, ill-fitting and looked like it was made by a blind seamstress (or an overworked factory worker with impossible quotas to fill). It actually was quite funny and made me laugh. I understand with Allegras fashion it is a big gamble. Prices are cheap and sometimes you will get a good item.

The credit card slots are in the biggest zipper pocket, the one in the back.

I center a key ring over the magnet base in the little front pocket and then close the magnet through the ring itself.  The keys rest in the pocket and stay put really well.  The little zipper pocket behind the magnet pocket is my currency pouch - I fold bills once crosswise to get them in and drop change in the bottom.  That's working better than I thought it would.  Behind that is my smart phone in a roomy zipper pouch, and there's a zipper pocket in the wall of that pouch where I put my bigger key ring - the one with RFID tags, a flash drive, and keys.  The very back zipper pouch is where I put my credit cards, my sunglasses, and my Altoids box, with loops at the top, one of which has my lip balm and other has my pen.  In the back outside wall is another zipper pocket, flat, and that's where I put my transit pass.  I don't ordinarily carry my Kindle, but I tried it in the biggest zipper pocket, and it does fit very nicely.\n\nMy smart phone would fit really well in the back wall flat zipper pocket where I have my transit pass, but I like the transit pass there.\n\nPluses:  This handbag is seriously cute.  It's way smaller than I expected, but that's great, I wanted small.  Having a place for everything makes finding any one thing so much easier.  I got the mushroom color, and it's very pretty - darker than the picture seems - with a pretty light blue lining.  It's easy to see everything that's inside.  The quality appears to be really good, too.  The strap adjusts from what I would consider to be a very short shoulder strap length to very long, and you can easily remove it completely.  You can thread a belt through it and wear it as a waist pack.\n\nI went from disappointed and unsure I would keep it to actually quite pleased with it.  Give it a chance.\n\nUpdate:\nI tried the Wallet Bagg after buying this one, and it was too big.  I went back to this one, and I'm buying two more, charcoal and pewter.  I wish it came in some of the fun prints.  Whatever, this is my purse from now on.  There's more room than the smart phone needs in the front zipper pocket, so I laid my big key ring in the bottom of the pouch and dropped the smart phone in on top of  it.  If I decide to upsize when I get a new phone, I'll still have lots of room.  I keep my RFID key fobs in the zipped wall pouch behind the smart phone so they don't fall out, and when I want to use one I just pass the purse near the sensor and I'm in without taking the key fob out or even opening the purse.\n\nMy husband has the Kindle Touch and I have the cheapo Kindle with ads on it, and either one will fit in either of the two larger pockets, as unlikely as that seems.\n\nI love this purse.  I can find anything I want in it instantly, it weighs nothing, and it's darling.", "summary": "Perfect - buying two more", "unixReviewTime": 1339545600}

The secret pocket in the back holds my passport.  The next pocket is just right for my Kindle Touch with lighted cover and two pens. (It has nice little pen holders there).  The pocket in front of that perfectly fits my wallet, pack of tissues, iPhone (that's in an Otterbox Reflex case) and iPhone cords. There's an inner, zipped pocket that holds thumb drive and keys. The pocket in front of that holds my odds and ends.  Who would think that such a small bag could hold so much.  It's practically the TARDIS.\n\nThe belt loops in the back of the bag that make it convertible to a waist-pack are big enough that just about any belt can be used.\n\nThe cons:\nAlthough it can be used as a waist-pack in a pinch, it's rather clumsy for that purpose.  It pulls away from your body.  The shoulder strap is meant to be convertible for the waist-pack but doesn't feel secure and it has to be adjusted.  I purchased a webbing belt to use when I wear the bag at my waist.\n\nThe little front snap pocket is practically useless.\n\nThe fabric does not seem very sturdy.

I can get the XL on, but at the tightest I could get it, it was tight around the waist, but so lose around the rib cage (upper part of the corset) that I could fit my entire arm in there!\n\nI had my husband help me lace it up as tight as he could, and it was still loose enough around the upper part that I could still, with some difficulty, get my arm in there. Corsets are supposed to fight very tightly, so this was disappointing. Part of the appeal of wearing a corset, for me, is the dramatic way my bust stands out over the top of it, and with how lose the top of this corset was, my DDD bust looked like a late-blooming middle schoolers'. That was with it laced so tightly that I was having acid reflux, so I don't think the issue is the size of the corset, because when it's laced that tightly I'd expect it to be at least snug everywhere.\n\nI'm giving it two stars because it has great material and seems like it would be very durable.

I'm a regular corset wearer, so I knew how to counteract some of the issues that cropped up in the reviews, but I think this will be my go-to for daily wear now. The laces could stand to be a little longer, because it does run a little small. I can't get it up over my hips when closed and fully expanded, even though it should be the right size for my waist (I have to clip it around myself, which is a little time consuming, but possible). What I really loved is that it came pre-laced (CORRECTLY!); that is huge. Most mass produced corsets have to be laced when you get them, and almost no one does it right. It's stiff enough to reduce my waist several inches, but flexible enough to wear comfortably all day. I did not experience any of the issues with slippage with sitting that others reported; my guess is that they are not tightening it enough or wearing it in the right place. I wear a thin cotton tank top under it, too, which helps it (a) stay where it's supposed to; (b) keep it from digging into my skin when tightened and (c) stay clean longer--the fabric isn't very breathable, and would probably be a sweaty mess if you wear it with skin contact.\n\nOverall, I'm really happy with it--really can't beat the value! And yes, it is real steel: the front has two solid rods that act as a sort of busk, and additional spiral steel. It doesn't have as many as some of the pricier corsets, and some appear to be spiral for flexibility, but for $30 I really can't complain.

Fairly fast shipping for a product hailing from China. Now onto my little review.\n\nAt a glance, this big heart of blue captures the eye with its golden gleam and deeply shimmering azure stone of glass.\nFor my case, I came across a couple of minor issues; however they do not take away from the general wonderfulness of this product.\n\nWithin a few hours of first wearing it, the clasp's spring mechanism failed and broke, leaving me to remove it and connect the two rings together. Thankfully, the chain it comes with is quite easy to fit over the head, so the loss of the clasp was nothing mortifying.\nSecondly, the frame itself seems a tad bent at the top of the heart, as if someone purposefully tried prying it off. The pretty glass gem inside mine in particular is certainly too small for the frame; although it matches in shape. However, I noticed that there is a small loop at the bottom of the heart, of which I used to wrap string through to keep the gem stable. Nonetheless, it still shakes around side to side, generating a fair amount of noise and concern over the glass. Glue in the edges of the frame should solve that issue, should any of you come across a similar case. I chose to be lazy and leave it be with the string --for now anyway.\n\nNow back to the frame of the charm.\nI've been wearing it steadily for a few days, perhaps even a week, and I've noticed signs of tarnishing in the 'gold' finish, most likely due to skin oil. Perhaps a frequent wipe-off or rinse will fix this, but I am unsure. I'm still experimenting upon the posting of this review.\n\nDespite my little issues, I am satisfied with this product, especially for something with such a small price. Quality is fair, and only has small issues that are easily walked around. I'd say that these are a hit and miss with quality, and I happened to be in the middle ground with mine.\nThis necklace is overall a neat gift for Zelda fans, and I would recommend taking the gamble to grab yourself a neat heart container!\n\n-TW", "summary": "Neato!

There was only a one-size-fits-all option. My slip arrived promptly and was in excellent condition and looked to be of surprisingly high quality considering it was less than $20. The color was very close to what was pictured on my monitor although somewhat brighter. It was still absolutely gorgeous and the fabric was very comfortable. I am someone who is a bit particular and sensitive as far as fabrics go, so I would have been disappointed if it were scratchy or cheap feeling. I have felt finer fabrics, but again, this garment is less than $20, so I'm not expecting the finest chiffon or silk. I'm happy with polyester/spandex.\n\nThe fit is fabulous for the most part except for the chest. I loved the way it hugged my hips and waist and skimmed my stomach. I wasn't surprised that it was too small in the chest as I wear a 34E - 34F bra. However, I have tried on other lingerie similar to this which has been too small in the chest and it has still been flattering everywhere. The difference seems to be how the slip is cut/sized at the underwire portion of the garment, but I'm not positive. It just didn't sit flat against my body so the underwire was partially up my breasts and just not as flattering as it could be. I actually just looked more closely at the product photos while writing this review and it appears as though the exact same condition is happening on the model as well.  If it's of any help to anybody, my measurements are 38 chest, 30 waist, 38 hips. I normally wear a US Size 8 in clothing.

The color is a little bluer (more blue topaz rather than turquoise) than the picture, but that's not an issue as we weren't expecting it to be exactly the same.  Looks well made and they included a sewn in petticoat at no extra charge.  We were contacted the day after order placement and gave them daughters specific measurements.  She is a size 0.  There is a liner between the petticoat and legs.  Bodice looks sturdy and has boning throughout.  No scratchy edges to speak of inside, Nice and smooth.  The lacing for the corset back was also included and is not ribbon as I expected but an actual sewn piece of satin which is fantastic.  I will be recommending Artie dress to anyone I know looking for a good quality bargain priced prom dress.  Just for perspective, I found this same dress on another website for 518.00..

She felt very confident that the gown would not fall down (this is typically the issue for her with strapless dresses)  Discovered that the sewn in petticoat is uneven (one side longer than the other by about 12 inches), but it doesn't seem to affect how the dress hangs so I'm not taking any stars off for that.

However, the details on the emblem are smudgy (see photos of real vs this case). Its also not even close to the quality of the real leather case and has no leather smell at all (the real one does and has a very flexible & soft feel to it). In fact, the only smell is inside the case and smells like cheap glue. Again, it is very close to the original from afar but for the same price you can buy a real one from Ray-Bans website.

The finish of the rose gold is beautiful. Not too pink. Not cheap looking. Totally matches my other 14k rose gold pieces. If you buy the 8mm size, just be sure to slide backs close to the backs of your lobes to counter the weight of the stud. If you don't, they will look like they are weighing your lobes down. I'm so impressed, I will be purchasing another pair in yellow gold, but probably in the 6mm size. The only thing I can say that I didn't care for was the packaging.

I went ahead and got my usual size (2X), albeit with concern that I would have to suck my breath in and wiggle them on as I do with some skinny jeans, but these pulled on easily and I was so thrilled because I could tell immediately that the fit was perfect.\n\nThese are somehow stretchy while still conforming nicely to your hips and curves, yet not being too tight in the leg area!\nI have been telling everyone about these because they are the best pair I've had in years, and i feel awesome wearing them!\n\nI posted some photos of me in these jeans on my social media and got SO many responses...! VERY SEXY jeans that make your butt look AMAZING. I can't say it enough!\n\nUnlike the previous reviewer, I had no issue with them loosening up. In fact, I am USED to that happening with all my stretchy skinny jeans. I have a pair that look so good on right after washing, but after about 30 minutes are sagging in the back. THESE jeans however do NOT sag at all.\nI wore them THREE times before washing,  and they fit just as well the third time. They loosen up naturally, but only a little bit which is NORMAL with stretchy fabric. They do NOT sag, the hug my bottom beautifully :)\n\nThey are so comfortable, unlike my other skinny jeans which tend to cut off my breathing a bit in the belly area. These move with your body and look good at the same time!\n\nMy only problem is when I am putting them on, I keep catching my toe in the destroyed part on the front leg, but that's my own fault, I just need to remember to be more careful when putting them on.\n\nYou are sure to get compliments in these, I sure did!\n*Sample provided for review purposes, all opinions are my own", "summary": "Sexy and form fitting, with great stretch!", "unixReviewTime": 1431388800}

I hate wearing hats (I really don't look good in them) but with the heat that I knew I was going to be experiencing, I was willing to get over that.  I wanted a running hat because I figured that the moisture wicking aspect would help me feel cooler in addition to the open mesh.  The hat was comfortable to wear and nice and airy.  It dried quickly after going on water rides and did not trap my sweat in, instead allowing it to evaporate as promised.  My husband will wear it for running now that we are back from the trip but the one thing I don't like about it is that the sweat band area is not an absorbent material so it does not stop sweat from running down your face (the hat minimizes the amount of sweat that you produce but it doesn't block what does form from falling).

I ordered this ring so I would have something to wear when I took my real ring in for repair. The center stone is a little large for my taste. From far away it looks pretty but close up you can see the flaws in the setting. The stones in the channels are not all in a straight line. There is a white residue in some of the creases that I can't clean out...it may just be an unpolished edge that appears white in color. The CZ in the channel doesn't sparkle as much as the center stone. The stainless steel setting appears dull and darker than white gold/platinum/silver.

The stock photos do not do it justice!! Get ready for a lengthy review, lol! There are some buyer photos including my own that help more...But seriously. Its Soooo sparkly and shiny I wanted a larger stoned ring to replace my last one that I now where on my right hand. My original wedding set (bought on amazon, btw, also amazing)  has inlaid CZs, which for me tend to be sturdier than the alternative. Really excited to finally find another inlaid set. I am a bit nervous for the front stones, so I will be updating this review in 6mo. and a year... Or until a stone falls out, as they are not inlaid, and other reviews have said they've come loose. However, I don't feel like it would totally ruin the look of the ring, and for the price, might as well just buy a few for back ups if it does ever happen. It's a light ring for it's size if it were real, but it does still have some top heavy weight to it that makes you feel like you're actually wearing an expensive ring, but it's not at all bothersome. As for size, I was always a 7 so I always order 7, but I think I'm more a 6.5 these days. It fits the same as my other size 7, however it doesn't flip around wuite as bad as my other engagement ring-- I'm assuming because of how the band is spread out. Either way, this thing is gorgeous, and from an arm's length away, unless you knew diamonds REALLY well, I don't think you'd be able to tell it's not real. And you gotta love stainless steel. I work a rough job, I do have a silicone ring for most of the time, but some days I forget, so its nice to have a metal that doesn't bend too easily or tarnish. They do scratch easy though, but that's the nature of the metal and eventually the whole thing will be scratched and you won't really notice any of them.", "summary": "ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!!", "unixReviewTime": 1498176000}

I won't change the fact that the sizing is deceptive but I was willing to update my review if they had processed a full refund to reflect that they had in fact refunded my $$ without my returning the shirt. That did not happen, they initially compromised with a $5 refund which doesn't do me much good but I guess it was better than nothing.

Regular tungsten is a darker gray.)\n\nCOMFORT: Looks and wears like a true comfort fit with smooth, rounded edges.\n\nDURABILITY: Two and a half months after our wedding, there is not a single scratch on this ring, even when viewed under magnification. It looks absolutely brand new. Despite the fact that tungsten is naturally more brittle than gold alloy and other metals used in jewelry-making, so far the ring has stood up to what I would consider an above average level of wear and tear without breaking.\n\nPRICE: Ridiculously affordable. Just under $18 as opposed to $300-400+ for good quality white gold (that scratches and needs polishing once a year)? A no-brainer. Plus, you get to skip the worries that accompany wearing an expensive piece of jewelry. If you ever lost this ring, replacing it would be a breeze.

If you are looking for a workhorse of a wedding band, white tungsten carbide is the way to go.\n\nMy husband has wore 2 consecutive gold bands to paper thin nothingness. This ring in the 4mm has been great for him; he works in maintenance.\n\nI've had a 6mm from MJ Metals since 2014 and wear it almost everyday. I work part time as a florist and love gardening, so that ring has been through some rough times and it still looks fabulous. I need my bifocals to see any wear.\n\nI wanted to try a wider band, so of course reordered from MJ Metals. I love it. My sister tried it on and said her pinky finger started to fall asleep after wearing it for a few hours. She doesn't have that problem wearing the 6mm. Maybe that's why the 8mm is more of a men's size. The other difference between the 6mm and 8mm is the edge of the ring. The 6mm has a thicker edge than the 8mm. Both are comfort fit and domed. My guess is the 8mm dome would be uncomfortably thick to taper to the edge thickness I'm used to on the 6mm. Again, after 3 years, I love my 6mm white tungsten carbide.\n\nThe only other fyi is on the color. It does have a dark under tone next to sterling and white gold even though it has a mirror shine like chrome. So, the color may bother someone looking to wear an engagement ring on the same finger as this ring.", "summary": "White Tungsten Carbide is a beautiful workhorse of a wedding band", "unixReviewTime": 1503705600}
