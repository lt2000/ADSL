The wig presented itself very well. I got a lot of complements on it along with the questions of where I got it from. After the party, the wig is still in perfect condition. It should last you for more than only one wear. Definitely worth every penny!\n\nPROS:\n - very natural\n - full\n - the color is exactly as pictured\n - great packaging\n - will last you longer than one wear\n\nCONS:\n - price (it's a little expensive BUT it's definately worth every penny!)\n - visible wig-line (but you can easily fix it, if you spend some time on it)", "summary": "Great wig", "unixReviewTime": 1352160000}

One the zipper gets stuck easily, but thankfully it's high quality enough so that I don't have to worry much about it getting permanently kinked or broken anytime soon. But the second and biggest complaint I have is that darn flexible bottom section it has that i always hate on sweaters because it always rides up so easily, I knew this would be an issue too that's why I bought it one size bigger( I'm xl). So If I did buy it my size that would mean the sweater would be basically unwearable.\n\nIt's still a great sweater though, and if you're a small averaged size guy it would be no problem for you, I love the look of the sweater too very unique designs and it's quite the conversation starter.

The quality of the fake glasses was impressive but the RB engraved in the lenes was not in the lense like real pairs, you could easily feel that it had been scratched into the fake lenses.\nDo not buy these glasses.

I find myself staring at it all the time in the mirror and even as I type this review.  I wasn't sure what to think of it at first when I got the box, seeing that it was a Seiko.  When I think of Seiko I think low cost, legit quality, nothing flashy, good for active lifestyles, but not too attractive.  When I opened the box I was pleasantly surprised by the size of the face, the unique way the colors and dials all blended together, and the weight/feel of the watch when I picked it up.  This is a solid watch with crisp, sharp hands.  I love the black middle section of the band and the white 5-minute increment markers.  You really have to see this watch in person because the picture doesn't do it justice.  This is probably one of the more expensive Seikos I've ever seen, even though I don't shop for watches much, and though I got it as a gift I think that the prices I see for it now are fitting for what you get.  Don't take my word for it, go to the store and look at it or check out better pictures on the Seiko website.  My only regret is that I feel bad for my Swiss Army watch I got for Christmas (I'll probably have to hide this one from my parents for awhile haha).\n\nPositive highlights\n- Great face size and thickness\n- Masculine but elegant colors (black and white) with hints of chrome, red, and silver\n- Black center wristband links to match the black face areas\n- Great weight; not too heavy but feels like you've got something special on your wrist\n- Kinetic Direct Drive, self-winding with a power meter that noticeably moves upon rapid arm movement (I thought this would be pointless but then I remembered my girlfriend's similar Eco-Drive Citizen watch that ran out of juice unexpectedly; the meter hasn't even come close to nearing empty yet); you can even wind/power it with the crown if it's ever completely dead\n-You can set the day of the week as well as the date\n\nNegative highlights\n-No chronograph, which I was liking with my old watch for keeping track of grilling steaks and burgers but I guess it's not hard to remember what time I start something...\n-Original price (I think I've seen it for as high as $1800 somewhere, a couple $1600, but the Seiko website has the MSRP at $1300 right now); regardless you can find this for around $700-$900 right now and I honestly think it is at the top of the ladder if you like Seikos or Japanese watches\n-No precious metals or rocks, but who needs those really when it looks great without them?\n\nConclusion\n-Unique, manly, elegant.  Subtle hints of flashiness.  Check this watch out and try it on yourself and I doubt you'll be able to say it is not a quality, attractive piece.  If you're looking for something you can wear day-to-day at work, running errands, or even going out for under $1500, even under $1000, look no further.", "summary": "GREAT Watch", "unixReviewTime": 1248134400}

Whoever made the plastic mold for the frames made a critical mistake when designing the frames because they fail from even the slightest pressure. Put them in your pocket, they break. Drop them on concrete, both sides will break. Look at them the wrong way, they will break. I have wasted so much money trying to find Oakley look-a-likes I might as well have just spent the money on real Oakley's. These are a huge waste of money, even at such a low price. The point of failure is on the top edge of the frame on the left and right sides of the nose bridge. Even if the glasses are just sitting on a table, they will eventually break because the frames have a weird elasticity to them that puts constant pressure on this weak point. It's a really strange engineering failure, and a real shame because they look great.

I actually went back and bought another pair for my son, because I liked them and he liked the way they look.  I know a lot of people get hung up on particular brand names, which I've always thought it nonsense.  No, these aren't Oakley or whatnot, but you're also not paying a premium just to have some brand label on your glasses.  They're comfortable, functional, and stylish.\n\nI tend to prefer glasses that don't have nose pieces on them, since not only do they bend and misshape the glasses eventually, but they're nowhere near as comfortable.  These glasses are quite comfortable.  They do have a bit of a \"hipster\" look, but overall they're a pretty standard style.  The lenses are pretty large, which is actually good since the sun can come at your eyes from all directions.  Since my wife works in ophthalmology (doing eye surgeries) I hear a lot of terrible stories about the various damage done to people's eye either in accidents or by not taking care of them over time.  So having good coverage on my eyes was important.\n\nI can't really judge just how much UV light these things block, since I don't have the testing equipment and humans can't really see light in that spectrum.  But what I DO know is that it dims things just enough that you're not squinting, but it doesn't darken your environment.  I'm guessing these might also block some of that \"blue light\" people complain about with things like monitors screens.  I only say that because it does make cell phone screens look a little dimmer.  So, if you're walking around outside with your smartphone, you're going to want to turn the brightness all the way up (if you don't already).\n\nIn short: cool looking glasses that work for you whether you're a teenager, or a parent in your 30's... hahaha", "summary": "Comfortable, stylish glasses at an excellent price!", "unixReviewTime": 1468972800}

I was hesitant because of the price but went for it over the other red dress options because I figured,  for $90, it might be more like a regular red dress than some cheap looking costume item purchased at a Halloween outlet store. The material is less than mediocre and because it is so cheap and so \"slinky\" it was ridiculously difficult to alter on my own and I had to pay someone else to do it. The slit is in an unflattering location for most all body types and is not designed well. The cup sizes are way too small in comparison to the length and size of the rest of the dress. (Why can't skinny girls have big, natural (or not) boobs! No one ever gets those proportions correct! The top of the chest area is MUCH \"pointerier\" than shown in photo and the small amount of piping used to try and create a bodust-style appearance but the only thing it does is make it very difficult to alter .. I ordered size S thinking it would be better for my chest to be popping out a bit (Jessica Rabbit) vs. messing with the length and screwing up the slit, etc,  but the model they used (supposedly wearing a small) must have been 6'2 because it was so long I could have made a 2nd dress with the leftovers from altering. I'm no model but I have a pretty decent body and can wear close-fitting clothing with out issue,  however this material shows EVERYTHING on EVERYBODY; you can see birthmarks in this thing folks. ALso the material is not as \"sparkly\" as it was described but it does have a nice iridescent sheen to it that sorta replicates a \"sparkly red.\" Overall I would say if you don't mind the additional cost of altering the entire dress and you have a 10+ bod, go for it.

Yes. I have to admit, I was so excited when the ring arrived (well in advance of the estimated date, by the way. Super fast shipping!!), and it was a bit of a let down to slip it on my hand to try it out. A week later, I'm ok with it, and I'm excited to add it to my hand on my wedding day.

The search took me to the next generation of face protectors, those made out of Neoprene. They were cheap enough that I bought some for the whole family. My thought was they would probably be alright for cool days, but since they were so cheap, they wouldn't hold up for the harsher Northern Illinois/Wisconsin winters. The designs available were amazing, from plain black to cool abstract designs.\nOn Christmas morning everyone was pleased with the items because they looked so cool. However, when they wore them outside, the real surprise happened! These things WORK. They actually keep your face warm. Now, it was 15 degrees, which is warm for winter up here, but there was no indication that these things could not handle lower temps. Not only do they work, they are extremely light and comfortable. My wife is a bit claustrophobic, yet the mask did not bother her at all. The eye holes even allow you to wear glasses! The covered mouth piece has enough holes to make breathing easy, but does not expose you to the cold. I can only say that I am now happy to 'discover' these items, and I will be extolling their virtues to all other Winter Workers!", "summary": "A Warm Surprise", "unixReviewTime": 1356912000}

Like I said the quality looked cheap like a $20 version off eBay. It very well may be a nice ring to some but I was looking for an exact replacement identical to the one pictured and this was not it, and after $100 some dollars I did not want a cheap looking version.

I chose this wig because of its length, color, and it was curly so I thought it would be easy to tease up big. Also the price was cheap. It arrived in good time and the amazon packaging was great. However the manufacturer's packaging was bad. The front left side off the wig was stuck to the tape used to close the bag it was in, which made that part of the wig frizzy and tangled. The only other negative is that top of he wig towards the front you can see the cap part. Other than that the wig was great. It was as bright in person as it was in the picture. I feel that the length was a tad shorter than shown but my wig also looks a bit curlier than in the picture. The part of the wig that didn't get taped was great. The curls are frizzled free and defined. I've had the wig for about 3 weeks now, one of those its been in my back seat, and the curls are still holding up pretty well.  I wore it to work(I'm a bartender) and it stayed on my head great. It did fit a little snug which was great for me since I move and bend over a lot for work.

Its one item in a bag - no quality control?\nANSWER: This appears to be a straight-up business con known as bait and switch.\nFACTS:\n1. What I received is NOT an authentic Chamilia box-clasp bracelet as shown. What I did receive is at best a silver-color bracelet with a lobster-claw clasp.\n2. Chamilia does make a lobster-claw clasp bracelet, but it is stamped with logo and 925, indicating verification of silver metal content.\n3. To make things worse, the silver COLOR on the lobster clasp bracelet I received is heavily oxidized (see photos below) showing the base metal, therefore DEF NOT 925 sterling silver.\n4. In addition: The ferrules on both ends of the bracelet do not match authentic Chamilia bracelets I already own.\n5. As an avid Chamilia collector, I have serious doubt that this is in fact a Chamilia piece at all.\n6. A previous buyer noted the problem and I posted a question. A second buyer replied saying she received the item shown. So my choice was my mistake. It won't happen again.\nDONT BE FOOLED!!!", "summary": "DONT BE FOOLED!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1515456000}

I asked in person at the store about discontinued shoes, and looked around online, but the only thing available was that one pair of shoes. My very active child would have those scuffed and brown very quickly, and they don't look at all like big brother's or mommy's regular tennis shoes, so I started searching around for something that would be a good flexible pair of shoes while he's learning balance and stride. I saw a few different brands that were well-recommended, but they all seemed to be velcro only. I saw the Preschoolians here on Amazon, and thought I would try them out. They came a few days ago, and they work great! They came with three different insole inserts in wide, medium, and narrow. The medium and narrow looked about the same width, so I left the medium they came with in the shoes even though my child has pretty narrow feet. So far, they've been working well. The soles are very flexible and bendy. The front of the sole is clear and has a \"right fit\" window so you can take out the insole and see where your child's toes are in the shoes. I laced him into his shoes the other day and after quite a bit of trying, he managed to get one off about 15 minutes into a car ride (typically he gets both shoes and socks off within a 5 minute car ride). I retied it a little tighter when we got where we were going. After about 2 hours of shopping, he had gotten the other off (again, this usually happens much more quickly). I retied it a little tighter and we headed back home. On the half hour car ride, he tried several times, but did not get the shoes off again. He seemed to have no problems walking in them, though they're a bit big since they're equivalent to a 6.5 because of European sizing and he just outgrew his US sized 5.5 shoes.", "summary": "Good flexible shoe for a new walker", "unixReviewTime": 1363478400}

I know they are reading this because this is yet again another prevention by them in order to excuse their incapability to provide the expert treatment they have advertise to give to other customers, but now they're nervous since they've been paid for over a year and now they know that they will become exposed as fraudulent so they just had to interfere yet another time and I have no more limit for this type of behavior.

And a few scattered about, that are anywhere from 7.99- $15, a few I own are the \"as seen on tv\"- HD Vision sunglasses. Regular unisex square/rectangular shaped lenses, & they're what got me obsessed w/ HD/Brown &/or Gradient Brown lenses. Literally the 3 that I have are all the same. One pair I caused the inner part of the lenses to become all distorted & slightly ruined but still usable, do to me over using lens spray cleaner (I now only literally only use lukewarm water and a tiny bit of mild soap, just as they always recommend!). But I then went back to rite aid and grabbed 2 more pairs-@9.99 plus I get 20% off most stuff there, @7.99 ya can't go wrong. I started wearing those around the house day & night, I mean call me crazy, but I was/still am in love w/ how crystal clear, crisp, clean & vibrant these things are, my eyes are sensitive to lights all the time, so to explain the indoor wearing, & the gradient brown color are almost perfect due to not being that dark, hence comfortably wearing them all day, in/out, so finally, what I'm getting at is one night watching tv, & having a year old 1080p HD w/all bells/whistles, I'm used to a beautiful picture to begin with, so at one moment, I needed to go use the restroom, as&iacute; got up I took off the glasses to rub my eyes, then a quick glance at the tv WithOut glasses on, I realized WOW, the pic looked a bit crappier, then I put the glasses back on for a sec, & to my great surprise, they make an already great tv picture That-Much-Greater. Oh & btw, they're really decent sunglasses as well. Now sorry for my babbling, back to these X-loops, they're almost, pretty much the same, or fairly close however they're just a shade enough darker, that make me not able to wear them as long indoors, & 1 last thing, this is a bummer, but they are honestly not very clear, and \"free of distortion\", I'm talking, through zero fault of the owner, they like many others out there are just I suppose not made very well, when you've a clean lens and the view has a few kinks in it.

One thing to pay a lot of attention to is the way you launder this loungewear. I actually learned the hard way that it's a must to always follow directions and then some. You need to turn them inside out so you won't get pills on them. Wash in cold water on delicate and dry on delicate. I've found that air drying leaves a lot of wrinkles.  I use baby laundry detergent and liquid fabric softener.  Also, add a laundry enhancer for the pleasure of freshness. Don't hang on hangers, fold over the hanger to avoid humps on the top.

Miller", "reviewText": "I ordered this watchband directly from Clockwork Synergy. On the plus side, the black, silver gray and red colors of the band are exactly what I wanted, as are the buckle and keepers. Other NATO bands I've tried felt thin and cheap. I definitely like the feel of a heavier band. It looks great on my Citizen BM8180-03E Eco-Drive watch.\n\nOn the negative side, this is a NATO watchband modified to to be a Zulu. It does not have the second piece of strap that defines a NATO strap. This part has been cut off and heat sealed. I might not have minded the fact that I was actually getting a Zulu strap instead of a NATO if the heat sealing of the severed part of the strap hadn't been so poorly done. I'd only worn the strap a few hours before I felt the irritation from the ends of exposed threads.\n\nFortunately, I'd read that this problem could be fixed by using an emery board to smooth down the rough spots. Since applying this solution, the irritation has disappeared. However, I'm left wondering how often I'll have to keep filing down the thread ends and how this procedure might affect the long-term wear of the watch band.\n\nI don't really understand why Clockwork Synergy turned what had been a NATO band into a Zulu band, but continues to advertise it as a NATO band. If you buy this watchband, know what you're actually getting and be prepared to do a little work to make it comfortable to wear.", "summary": "A Zulu masquerading as a NATO", "unixReviewTime": 1519603200}

The two rings it does have are too close together to help keep the strap from hanging loose, especially if you don't have thick wrists. I didn't think it would matter, but it does. This design requires you to fold the extra strap material back under the two rings that are part of this design. As a result, this band sits useless in a closet now. It wouldn't be so bad except the proper bands cost half what this company is charging for this subpar band. Check out the Ritchie brand on Amazon.

However, all is not perfect. The edges are somewhat abrasive, mildly scratching the inside of the lugs and poking my wrist a bit. I noticed an itchy, irritating sensation and upon inspecting, it was because of the stitching on the inside of the band. Wish something was applied to smooth over those areas, would make it look and feel better.\n\n- The box it came in was nice and all, but I wish there was an option to just receive the strap without the fancy box and buy it at a lower price. Felt like I paid a bit more because of the box.\n\n- The thickness of the band was just right, did fit snugly past the spring bar to my watch, thankfully.\n\nMy watch looks so freaking nice with this, I actually saw someone post a picture of this, a strap with black round rings as oppose to grey metallic rings. I'm also thankful the rings do not flop around (so far), but are sturdy enough for me to push down and lock the band in place, as someone mentioned something about rattling which got me concerned. So overall, happy, though I have to find something to cover the part that's poking me.\n\nSomeone noted about how stiff the strap was. I'd prefer it being stiff and keeping it's shape then flop and look like a mess on my wrist. I had no problems using the strap.", "summary": "My First Impressions", "unixReviewTime": 1510358400}

They are so cute and super easy to slip on my daughters feet. She usually just wears them at home but on a few occasions have wore them outside of our home. I love that they are skid-proof, we have all hardwood floors so I really needed something for her so she would not slip and fall. These have excellent grip on the hardwood. These specific Robeez are reversible. The first side is leather with a suede backing and birdy appliques. The other side is all suede in the front and back with the bigger bird applique. I have actually thrown these in the washer twice and air dried them. They were tough enough to handle the wash (which is a major plus since she's a toddler and spills and stains happen!) My one and only complaint is that although they are reversible, trying to do so is a little hassle and the stress you have to put on the shoe to reverse it creases the leather side of the shoe. All in all great buy and I will be buying her more of these until we hit a size they don't make.

That company no longer sells this watch. I suspect because of all the complaints. Before they stopped selling it, they offered to let me keep it for free if I would not publish a negative review about the watch and and their company. I can tell by the picture that this is the exact same watch from the same maker. As a service to other Amazon customers I am publishing this review wherever I see this watch sold.\n\n This watch is so cheap it is like a bad joke. The front crystal is plastic. When I tried to pull off the clear plastic sticker that was affixed to the watch to protect the plastic crystal, I pulled out the crystal with the sticker. The watch weighs almost nothing because the case is paper thin cast aluminum. The \"bronze tone\" on the watch is either the cheapest plating ever or paint. It is easily scratched down to the bare silver colored metal beneath with the slightest pressure. The cover does not open all the way and it does not snap closed when you try to close it. (You have to push the button to get it to close) The watch face is positioned wrong so that you have to hold it like a stopwatch to read it. (I got a different pocket-watch from China recently and it was the same way. Apparently the makers of these Chinese trash timepieces have never seen a real pocket-watch or don't care to make them like real pocket-watches. Lesson: Just don't buy pocket-watches made in China) The cheap quartz movement inside is the size of a dime and obviously made for a small woman's watch. The battery is microscopic and I've never seen one like it for sale in America. Bet it costs more than the watch to replace it. May as well mention, the watch was running on the battery when I got it, that means the battery has been running down since it was put in the watch. They didn't even put in a piece of removable plastic to preserve the battery life until the watch was started by the customer. This thing is like a child's toy. (That is if you want your child playing with something cheaply made in China that is probably covered in lead paint and will break in seconds) I can't say enough bad things about this watch because there is nothing good to say about it. I see this watch being sold for over $20 by some companies on Amazon. They should give it away for free as an apology for the insult of just thinking of taking your money for it. (The way the company I bought it from did) Save yourself the time, trouble and cost of shipping it back after you get it and see it is worthless. Just don't buy this watch at any price.", "summary": "Don't buy at any price", "unixReviewTime": 1335139200}

It could be difficult to handle at times, and it doesn't 'grip' your pocket material at all. If not put in your pocket all the way, it could easily slip out. The design is terrific, but can be found in other brands, which I did, without the slippery texture leather. We'll see how long this one lasts.

The ring I originally decided to get my fiance was a $2000 ring from zales that is almost identical to this one except their stones are real diamonds. Since we moved the wedding date up I would have been unable to complete the payments in time. I begin to search amazon and I found this ring. The ring is worth the money. It has the same high quality look for nearly next to nothing. I read other reviews and was a little concerned about the finish. Once the ring arrived I scratched it a few times with my nails and I saw how easily it marked, but those scratches were easily wiped away with a soft cloth. My husband's finger is a size 12.5, these rings run big! I actually had to go down by a full size and the 11.5 fit great. the ring is very light and he says it is extremely comfortable. The CZ that were set in the ring wasn't a very high quality CZ (you are not going to fool anyone who looks closely) but it still looks pretty nice. The only thing that was a slight disappointment for me but by far is no deal breaker was the color of the ring. The picture displayed had more of a darker grey with a blackish undertone. The ring that arrived was much lighter, it had a light grey , stainless steel type of color. That wasn't a big deal but amazon was selling other rings that looked similar that had that color for half as much I sent more money because I thought I was getting that particular color.

The bracelet is a little small for my wrist. I'm a 6'4, 200lb male. My wrist measure about 7 1/4 \", by small I mean the bracelet still fits my wrist comfortably (the cord stretches) but traces of white cord were drastically visible between each bead. Also, some of the reviewers of similar bracelets mentioned how their bracelets fell apart after two or three days of use, with no strenuous activity.  I think they may have worn their bracelets in the shower.  From my personally experience many different types of stringed bracelets won't last long if worn in the shower, and like many people I don't care for taking my jewelry off before getting in the shower.\n Consequently, none of these complaints are an issue for me because I tackled the size issue and the falling-apart issue with one simple fix. I re-strung my beads upon receiving them in the mail. There are many different types of string that are used to string beads. Right now I testing out and researching what would yield the best strength and water resistance.  I combined the Tiger Eye Beads with beads from another bracelet in order to increase the length of my bracelet. In all, it took 22 beads to get the desired look and length I wanted.  I used 11 Tiger Beads and 11 beads from my other bracelet.  From my calculation there were only 17 beads on my original Tiger Bracelet.\nI am extremely happy with this product. The 10mm beads are the perfect size...not too big, not too small. I really wish I had something to compare the size to but they are considerably smaller than the Wood Calligraphy Word Beads that I purchased( maybe half the sized). It took a little work to get the product right for me and delivery takes a few weeks but I knew that going in, so I give this bracelet 5 stars.", "summary": "Beautiful Beads...Bracelet May Require Some Work", "unixReviewTime": 1348358400}

I love the subtle design too, especially the patent leather detail. Makes it stand out from others yet still looks classic\n\nI would've given 5 stars but for the price - you can get a 5-piece set for the same price on amazon.

It is very helpful if you have a low back dress but still want to have support and wear a bra - after all not everyone is a model! A lot of the non-transparent low back bra strap don't go low enough, so it is embarrassing when you wear a low back dress or top to a party or event and the bra strap keep hiking up, especially when your photos get circulated among the social media! Therefore the transparent strap in this bra is just perfect, even if it does hike up (if your dress/top is just touching or a bit lower than the bra strap), it is transparent and not very visible as the strap surface is matt. Don't expect the bra strap to last forever though as it will be oxidized and break after a few months to 1 year, depending on the climate. However, I think it is acceptable given the price of this product is not that high and you can't find many of these in the market that is strong enough and are not shiny.

Rice", "reviewText": "Where to begin...\n\nLets start with I bought one just like this from a large national jewelry retailer for somewhere in the neighborhood of about $450 back in 2007. I had 30 days to return it and I did just that. $450 just seemed like a ton of money to me at the time and still does for a mens ring. In addition to that I was loosing weight and these rings can NOT be resized. Once they are made that's what they are. Can you imagine having to replace a $450 ring that fell off your finger because it doesn't fit?\n\nA few years later I was surfing Amazon and decided to look into mens wedding rings since I had lost a bunch of weight and my original band didn't fit any longer. After quite a bit of searching I found the \"Concave Tungsten\" ring. I couldn't beat the price and at the time I purchased it I think it was somewhere around $90. They have since come down in price.\n\nI love the strength and luster of the tungsten, this very ring saved my hand from being smashed about a month ago. Had I been wearing traditional gold or white gold I certainly would have had a boogered up hand. I have tried other tungsten rings and have found that no other compares with this one in comfort. This ring is completely rounded. There is not a sharp edge on it. If I could get it in a dark color I would wear one on each hand.\n\nAs for the seller, I have yet to find a better seller anywhere. The first ring I ordered was 1 size too big. No questions asked, no hassles they worked with me to get it shipped back and they sent me a new one that fit just right. The ring size being wrong was not the sellers fault. It was mine as I thought I wore the larger size. Again this seller is great to deal with and was very helpful.\n\nAmazon was awesome as always.", "summary": "Great Ring at a Great Price", "unixReviewTime": 1370476800}

Lamb", "reviewText": "Perhaps you have noticed that in the boutiques these head pieces are about twice this price. This is certainly worth a try to cut cost. I would say that this headband (that has aspects of a tiara) is worth considering) It is by no means cheap, but it has just as much (or more) crystal sparkle and rhinestone as similar headbands twice its price. This headband is well designed as a floral motif that is subtle rather than obtrusive. This would go well with a gown that is similarly understated yet well constructed. This headpiece holds it's own without competing. This has a slight peak, making it similar to a tiara. From the back some pieces were glued while some were not, none of this is visible from the front. This is about 3/4 inches wide at it's widest point, a little shy of its advertised width of one inch. My major criticism of this piece it that it is not as heavy duty as some that I have seen. The wire the crystals are mounted on could possible kink without the more substantial headband backing. That is something to keep in mind. The positive is this is plyable to mold to the head using pins. This headband is quite beautiful otherwise and sparkles a great deal.

Beware, the ring may not match the size of JCPenney's ring sizers (I used their ring sizer to figure out what size I need, went with a snug fit on the sizer and this ring fits good).\nThe quality of the ring seems good enough (I'm no expert...this is my only other piece of jewelry, my other piece fell in the river, hence this purchase)\nThe finish of the ring is a little brighter/shinier than I expected from the picture.  The picture looks like it has a minor tint (like the last ring I had) although it does not.\nThe free engraving is as expected, no flaws or problems.  My previous ring did not have engraving, so I'm still adjusting to feeling the engraving on my finger inside the ring.  It is simply noticeable to tough due to a different texture; not irritating or rash causing.\nOverall I'm happy with the purchase.  My wife is pleased with the ring's appearance and that she got to choose what was engraved on the inside.

The box that it came in was not impressive, but the ring itself is just gorgeous, especially for the price! I bought a size 9 because I have bigger hands, and although it was a bit too big it works great as a middle finger ring. It IS very dainty, so if you are more into big gaudy jewelry, this isn't the ring for you.\n\nColor-\nI find that under natural light it appears to be mostly dark purple with a hint of green. The side stones are very sparkly, and the band is extremely reflective. It is very eye catching, so I wouldn't recommend driving with your ring hand out the window (unless you want to blind other drivers).\nIn unnatural light, more attention is drawn to the center stone because more color is visible (in my experience). I have received many compliments at work.\n\nDurability-\nIn the few days I have owned this ring, I have worked on cars, been in a hot tub, and done dishes. The stones are still intact and there doesn't appear to have any scratches on the band. The rhodium plating is wonderful over the silver, as it prevents tarnishing. So far nothing I have gotten my hands into have caused a chemical reaction with the rhodium. Also, it is a hypoallergenic noble metal, which is a plus.\n\nOverall, don't hesitate to buy this ring because you will have wished you did!", "summary": "Expensive-looking", "unixReviewTime": 1361750400}

And honestly I'm so glad I got these!  They're very light, and the size is just perfect: visible, but not too big.  They're definitely real gold, since my ears aren't itchy (even \"hypoallergenic\" jewelry irritates my skin).  The silicone backs are sooooo perfect; I can sleep in these earrings!  The only minor problems: the earring post is a little short compared to most other earrings I've used, and also it can take some finagling to get the rounded pushbacks attached, because I'm not used to the 'feel' and it's a little harder to position them by touch.

The leather is real, and it's strong, which means it won't break down for a while. The leather is admittedly thinner than previous belts I've used, but it doesn't appear to detract from its quality.\n3) perfect size - I wear very small pants (size 28) so I've become very accustomed to incorrectly sized belts and pants, since size can vary through brands. The largest size hole on the belt is definitely a little bigger than a size 30 pant. I wear a size 28, and use the third (sometimes fourth) hole on the belt.\n4) price - for $15, this is an unbeatable deal; especially for the quality. I plan on ordering another one soon, just to have after my current one inevitably starts to wear.

I don't use more than five cards regularly, so that was enough for my goto cards. Then, this wallet is currently holding 15 bills, six additional cards in the inside pockets, as well as all of my receipts from my recent business trip (I'm sitting in the airport writing this now). This is as much as I really ever stuff in my wallet, but it still closes and clips, and fits comfortably in my front pocket with no different feel than any other day.  I LOVE this wallet so much that when I lost my original purple one (which fades to a very dark purple after use, so it is not too flashy), I bought another from this seller immediately, even though I have 6 new wallets in boxes with the money clips and card holders sitting on my dresser.  The product shipped quickly and came much faster than the seller predicted, like a couple of weeks faster.  This one is brown, works exactly the same, and was used for two days before the old wallet was returned. I really should give the new one as a gift to get someone else hooked, but I am so protective of my favorite wallet that I am hoarding it in case the new one goes AWOL again.

What I received was a loosely knotted string, with little shell pieces with no shape around sliding around on it (and I'm not talking merely baroque uniqueness--I'm talking flat pieces of shell with zero lustre). There was only about 36 inches of it, give or take a few mms, since I've measured it, and it was supposed to be all of 64 inches. It also was not even 7mm per flat piece of shell--I have a real pearl necklace that's 7mm per pearl, and this was more like six or five mm per piece of shell. So, on top of its being of execrable quality, it wasn't even as long or its \"beads\" as large as they should have been (upon closer examination--I wrote a hysterical email to Amazon about the quality of the thing, period, but I found upon looking at it and wondering if I could get away with giving it as a gift to an indiscriminating kid [my niece], that it's not even the 64 inches that it was supposed to have been, and it's not even 7mm per piece of shell; and I found that I didn't feel good about even giving this to a nine year old that has no \"grown up\" jewelry of her own, period).\n\nAmazon has many, many wonderful sellers with wonderful products--for example, you can get a far, far better necklace (with actual, real pearls on it!), which even comes with earrings and a bracelet, for a mere 12.00 USD or so on this site; it won't be 64 or even 36 inches long, but it will at least be a pearl necklace, with decent lustre per pearl. Just search for \"pearl sets.\" But anyone who recommends THIS necklace, that I'm reviewing now, has to work for the company that sells this merde, or be a family member of the owner or something like that; there's no other explanation why any sane person with any sense of class, even someone who knows nothing about pearl jewelry, would give this a good review.  I am very sorry if this sounds abrasive, and I hope I haven't overstepped any boundaries or rules set up by Amazon for reviews or for writing a review after receiving a refund--if I wasn't allowed to do the latter, please remove this review immediately, Amazon; and if I have overstepped any rules at all in this review, I am frightfully sorry and give Amazon full permission to just remove my review or edit it.\n\nAmazon itself is a wonderful place to buy really wonderful deals--this is the very first time I've bought jewelry from Amazon and been even remotely disappointed; and I've bought quite a lot of jewelry from Amazon, for myself and for gifts, and it's always been great. All the sellers I dealt with, with the exception of this seller, were honest about what their products looked like and presented honest pictures of their products. This is the first time I've encountered this sort of horrible duplicity on the part of an Amazon seller, and, quite frankly, I was shocked.\n\nBut please, and I can't emphasize this enough, know you can count on Amazon to make it right, regardless of the issue.

The midfoot is made of synthetic leather.  To me, the quality of leather on the Mystics is very good for the price I got them for.  Though they do not stretch a lot like Kangaroo leather does, it still does the job very well, and it is also a very tough material, so striking the ball with these feel extremely comfortable.  The central lacing is a great feature.  Also, the tongue is not a fold-over tongue (like the tongue on the Copa Mundial), and it feels great!\n\nInside: No removable insoles, but the material that hugs the heel feels pretty nice and I didn't have any rubbing when playing in these for the first time.\n\nSoleplate: Fantastic for artificial grass.  all the studs are round, so you turn easier on the surface.  The sole plate is not only really durable, its also really flexible & light...great innovation from Nike! These also aren't bad to play on hard ground or even firm ground.\n\nFinal Verdict: This a fantastic shoe for the price!  They start out at $80, but they drop down to around $60-70 so I would definitely consider buying these over any other Nike takedown shoe.  Not only they are durable, they are pretty light too, weighing under 10 oz! Nothing about this shoe feels clunky or bulky, its a quality shoe, not the best, but it is probably better than most soccer shoes being sold under $100.  You won't be disappointed buying this shoe, since it will last you over a season or even more!\n\nFYI: Take extra care of leather soccer shoes because they tend to dry out (just apply some leather cream to the upper material a few times and you will be fine).", "summary": "Nike Tiempo Mystic IV AG", "unixReviewTime": 1354752000}

The small grey-print product description (I didn't see it before) on the next screen down does say 1\" length.  Also it says 1\" wide, which is significantly overstated, otherwise you'd have a circle instead of an oval, and 1\" in height which would make it 3 dimensional like an egg. That third dimension is just an ignorant statement. The photo shows, correctly, the item to be basically two-dimensional.\n\n Buying jewelry is not commonplace for me; I  expected a chain, too.  The ad did not show a chain; it didn't occur to me that there might not be one.  Caveat emptor.\n\nThe craftsmanship looks good.

Then I called them, and they said first the color I wanted (green) was on back order, but it was still at the manufacturer, so they would send it out right away. They also said they sent me an email the previous week to let me know. But the email was only sent the previous day. Next thing I know, more weeks later, my order has been suddenly cancelled, and the order not charged to my account, at least.\nI was looking forward to this blanket because it was the right color, and blankets for toddlers are hard to find. There are plenty for babies, and then for older kids, but I'm having a hard time finding in-between sizes for toddlers.\nSo, thanks, Andrew Christian for misleading me for a month.

It was actually much better then I expected because of other reviews and low cost. I bought this mainly because I'm a Twilight fan and a collector so I don't plan to wear it but I think you definitely could with no problem. It's good quality and looks great and will hold two small pictures inside. If you're looking for a very high quality piece of jewelry this isn't it because it's not an expensive product but it is very worth the money for an inexpensive locket. I don't think most will be disappointed for any reason.\n\nUpdate 11-18-16\nI would like to add that since I purchased this locket I have also purchased three more for others in my family. Two for my nephews and one for my mom to have as keepsakes. Initially I purchased one for myself as a huge Twilight fan and I was highly impressed by the locket. My little sister passed away just over a year ago, yesterday would have been her birthday. She also loved Twilight and had a tattoo of the locket around her ankle. It is now engraved on her headstone. I gave each of her two sons a locket of their own last night when we visited at the cemetery to remind them of their mom and how much she loved them. When I see my mom she will be getting the fourth one I purchased for the same reason. I honestly don't understand the bad reviews because this locket is a gorgeous piece of jewelry and well worth the low cost. The three I've received so far have been very sturdy, beautiful and just what I expected and I have no doubt the other on the way will be too. Mine came in a gorgeous white bag and the other two came in gorgeous blue bags. My nephews are each wearing theirs and love them and they've so far held up to two young boys having, wearing, touching, opening and showing off. I would highly recommend this item to any lover of Twilight or just those who find it beautiful. I don't see how anyone could be disappointed. All of mine have been very well made, packaged and shipped. The writing has been very clear, the color exsqisite and the chain nice and sturdy. One of my favorite jewelry items!", "summary": "Great Locket", "unixReviewTime": 1474243200}

However, since this was a last minute purchase and time was of the essence I was tempted to suck it up and wear the dress. Unfortunately, in addition to the poor material the dress has a noticeable odor. I doubted the dress would survive a wash so I ultimately returned the dress.

The dress came in a small envelope a little larger than a DVD!  But we knew from the reviews that it was going to be thin and we planned ahead for that.  What we didn't plan for was the stain.  I had to endure the requisite dramatic teenage crying jag over that but we just went to JCPenneys and got her a replacement dress (for $100 more!) that she's really happy with.  She'll be beautiful at prom but just not with this dress.  We sent it back immediately and UPS picked it up the next day.  I expect my refund will come quickly.

M.", "reviewText": "I have been suffering with pain for years but I thought this was normal for everyone to have such pain after waking up and always blamed my mattress etc.  I was diagnosed with A.S. after an iritis flare when the opthamologist sent me to a rheumatologist.  After starting a biologic I searched the internet for other natural ways  to decrease inflammation.  Copper and magnetic bracelets kept showing up as helpful for arthritis.  Even though I was very skeptical of such items I thought I would give it a try.  So then I researched which brand was the best.  Bioflow comes up as a class 1 medical device in Europe so I chose this one because it is also made of copper.  I have also ordered some Sergio Lub magnetic copper bracelets which are very pretty.  So I wore this bracelet for a month but didn't think it was working.  I honestly could not tell a difference.  One day after a trip to Las Vegas my foot started to hurt a lot from all the walking. It hurt for 2 days and I could barely walk on it. I was showing the bracelet to a co-worker on the internet when I noticed I was wearing it upside down, so I turned it around.  The next day my foot no longer hurt.  It may have been coincidence.  So I continued to wear it this way for another month.  As the copper color does not match my jewelry that well, I took it off (still skeptical) and replaced it with a different magnetic bracelet that was silver in color (stainless steel).  Within 2 days I developed an A.S. back flare.  So I put the Duo back on and felt better the next day.  Could be another coincidence,(or the biologic working) but I'm hedging towards becoming a believer for using this item in conjunction with prescribed medication therapy.", "summary": "bioflow", "unixReviewTime": 1352073600}

Since I was with my BF's parents I wore something under so it was not as revealing but otherwise would have worn it as is.", "summary": "Nice Cocktail dress", "unixReviewTime": 1406160000}

I vary between a size 6 and 8 and dresses can be tricky, but this size 6 is perfect because of the material. It's a flattering V cut without revealing too much and because of the color, it's easy to accessorize with. I'm average height and the dress comes to a little above my knees which imo, is a perfect length. For the price, this dress is hard to beat. From my experience with this specific dress, if you vary between two sizes, I think going with the smaller one will work better as this seems to have a looser fit.

It did arrive wrinkled (no big shocker to me but it appears to be a common complaint in other reviews) and will have to be steamed. The zipper does indeed stick a little where the bodice meets the skirt but that isn't a design flaw, per se. It just happens when several layers of fabric meet so you have to have some help to zip it up. Again, no big deal.\n\nI will be exchanging this size 8 for a size 10 but I do think the sizing is pretty accurate overall.

Also, instead of a sealed, leak-resistant design, this item has small holes at each end of the zipper where it attaches to the leather. The first time any of your toiletries breaks open and leaks  which we all know is a standard risk with toiletry kits  it will ruin the lining and leak out of the holes.

Shipped much quicker than was described.  Fits perfectly, but I had a strategy when selecting sizes:  I am a consistent 34C, ordered a 75D bra (because that was the enclosed sizing translation), but received a 75C, of which this error was to my advantage because it fits perfectly.  Though I am a dress or pant size 2-4 (or small), I have attained a couple extra inches around the waist in the last few years, so I ordered and received a M/38 garter, since there is no corset-type of cris-cross adjustment threading to tighten (nothing more unattractive than the sight of a garter that's too tight!).  It does fasten in back like a bra, with 3 rows of eyelet hooks as its adjustment feature.  My thinking was, \"better to be a little too big than to be at all too small\", and it fit perfectly too.  I ordered and received a S/36 thong panty, which also fits perfectly.  This feminine, attention-getting bra is a push-up bra, providing ultimate cleavage, with underwires and a shelf of removable push-up padding, which easily slides into their built-in pockets.  The straps are adjustable in length, and also adjustable for conversion into virtually any kind of outer-clothing style (bandeau, one-shoulder, halter, front-cross, back-cross, etc), or completely removable for a strapless bra all together.  It fastens in the back, with 3 rows of eyelet hooks for circumference adjustment.  The garter is the perfect element of balance to this ensemble, while daintily concealing any extra bulge one may have in their tummy.  But I warn you that only the sheerest of stockings will enable closure of the shallow plastic fasteners on the garter... any thigh-highs with a thick cuff will be impossible to fasten to the garter otherwise.  This non-lace, opaque material is buttery soft, and likewise, so is the sheer lace.  It is VERY comfortable to wear and soft on the skin, will not trigger itching, and is seemingly constructed quite well.  I have worn it once for a couple hours and could have worn it for much longer.  It truly does make you feel elegant and sexy, and I feel it would flatter any type of shape.  The color saturation is a couple shades darker/bolder than what was pictured using my monitor, however, but I assure you, this is still a classy ensemble and I can't wait to receive the matching grey stockings that I just ordered for it (a must!).  I have included pics of full details for each piece, since this was not provided in the ad.  For care to those of you who don't know:  as with all my lingerie sets AND per washing instructions of each piece, I will ONLY hand wash this set with only its own counterparts in cold water, with liquid laundry detergent for babies (Dreft), cold-water rinsing in highly diluted liquid fabric softener (do not pour straight onto the fabric... stir to equal consistency into your rinse water BEFORE adding the garments for rinsing), and pat dry between a folded bath towel (NEVER wring or twist)... as this is the ONLY way to maintain the initial shape, luster, and beauty of any lingerie article, while keeping the material snag-free and prolonging its lace to remain flawless and intact (and without clinging lint).  And please, at the VERY least, do not EVER put any lingerie garment in the dryer!  Very important if you want any type of lingerie to last and remain classy looking past its first wash.  I consider this purchase to be a great value and a great choice for anyone who loves the way they feel in intimate-wear.  My only complaint about this ensemble is that I don't quite look like the model does in it!  :)", "summary": "A Fantastic Purchase Choice...

I was considering buying one pair of Uggs, then had second thoughts due to the cost. The pair I would have purchased was approx $165. So I thought, what if I could buy 2-3 pairs of another type of boots made from similar materials? I found Bearpaw, which fit those criteria. So I purchased 1 pair and so far, love them. So I picked up a couple more in various colors & styles, all for the same total price of one pair of Uggs. Now, I don't know yet how they will hold up with time, but so far, very happy with the quality, comfort, style and price. These particular ones, i had to return the first pair I bought - the left shoe fit perfect and the right one I could just barely get on my foot. Amazon was great with the exchange, And the next pair fit, though a little more snug than any of my other Bearpaw boots.  Thus  the 4 star rating on these.  I love the silver  buckles on the side.  I will post more if necessary as to how well they hold up", "summary": "Really like them", "unixReviewTime": 1354665600}

It's very pretty and seems to be of good quality to last a while.  For the price, I would have loved to have bought several in different colors but since they are offered by this vendor in whole sizes only, I needed to see how the fit would be.  I found that a store-bought size 9 was just a teensy bit tight at certain times of day, on my \"man hands\" (large knuckles) so I ordered this ring in a 10.  (The stores only offer up to size 9; go figure.)  The 10 is loose now, during winter cold, however it may be fine during the hot, humid months.  I love how it looks on my hand, makes it looks a little daintier.\n\nI have noticed other reviews expressing wishes for this to be offered in half sizes.  I will say there is at least one other vendor on Amazon that does, indeed, offer eternity bands in half and whole sizes, in different colors of stones.\n\nThe stainless steel material used in this ring was a clever idea and it looks great.\n\nUpdate:  still liking my ring very much.  Don't wear it every day but when I do, I get compliments.  The other vendor's size information was inaccurate; they were selling the size 10 and calling it a 9 1/2.

The fabric is smooth without any flaws and all of the stitching is quality - no stray threads to clip.\n\nThe outer shell is lightweight and it is lined with color-matched fleece which is removable via side zippers and snaps at the top.  The full front zipper has a snap placket, there are two snap chest pockets and two deep front pockets.  The drawstrings at the waist, hem, and hood all have toggles to cinch the strings closed.  The wrists have adjustable snaps and the hood, which is unlined, can be detached by five buttons.  All the buttons and snaps are color-coordinated.  There is also a vent with a snap mid-back.\n\nThis jacket is loose, allowing for movement and bulky sweaters.  Driving is part of my job and having a jacket which is not constraining while being light was my major consideration for purchasing this item.  I chose the Dark Pewter which is a dark gray with a steel blue tinge.\n\nI highly recommend this jacket if you like your outerwear a bit on the long side.

The sleeves are short and the lining in the sleeves bunches up above the wrist as it is secured in place by one snap attaching the lining to the outer shell.

I would mostly wear the hip belt at a time when I'd be up and walking around, cooking, etc, because it felt awkward to wear while sitting.

I wore it until 7 weeks postpartum (when I developed some pubic symphysis pain that my midwife & neurologist didn't think were related to the hip belt).

That's fine though because I was looking for a thin wallet that didn't have a hundred pockets and dividers in the currency sleeve, as though I need to keep my hundreds separated from my fives. Well, this fits the bill (pun intended- note singular use of the noun) but they've taken the minimalist design a tad too far. Cards do not fit in the slots and once you have forced them in you need pliers to get them out. There are only 6 card slots but oddly when they are all filled the wallet is reluctant to close flat, and that's before you try to put anything in the hidden sections. And as far as folding money is concerned, my advice is to travel light; perhaps a couple of hundreds because much more than that and wallet is not going to fold flat. This is basically a step up from a money clip so unless you travel with maybe 4 credit (ATM, library, Moose Lodge Club, etc) cards, a couple of biz cards and a few bills you can drop the \"fold\" from \"billfold\". Overall a nice looking wallet with just average construction. Oddly, the long section of leather is split into 2 pieces. Not sure if this is a design feature or just saving cost on a larger piece of leather but creates an annoying bump where the overlap seam occurs vertically, just past the halfway point on the backside of the wallet. Did I mention the nice box...?", "summary": "Wish wallet was as nice as the box it comes in", "unixReviewTime": 1402358400}

My diamond (on top) is a 1 carat, so this 1.25 carat fake diamond is slightly bigger, but nearly identical to my true ring. Good buy!! Cant wait to wear it t the gym everyday!", "summary": "My new Gym ring!! Size 4 beautiful fake that looks real", "unixReviewTime": 1516665600}

After much searching, this was the only piece that fit the \"rose and thorn\" look I wanted. There were so many \"rose-colored\" items, or rose-shaped jewelry, but to find a piece that had both rose and thorn, and was pretty and interesting to boot, I couldn't be happier.\n\nIt's a delicate piece but also a statement piece that isn't too feminine and cutesy - something I didn't want in a \"rose\" theme--so you have something that people will notice and comment on, but not something that calls too much attention to itself. It lies nice against my chest, as well. The chain isn't a good quality but for the price I didn't expect it to be, and didn't care, for I have other chains--besides, I didn't even know it would come with a chain. Though, the three times I've worn it, I've kept the chain it came with, simply because it's unobtrusive enough to disappear and let the piece shine on its own. It arrives in a blue \"satin\" bag, along with information on how you can \"power up\" the amulet - I didn't buy it for that, but I'm curious to read about it.\n\nI'm always  hesitate to buy jewelry online, for it's difficult to tell what you truly will receive. However, this piece looked prettier than the photo shows. The crystal is clear and lovely, and the red roses tiny and well-formed. The silver \"thorns\" wrap around the crystal, giving it that unique look. The red teardrop adds some dimension to the entire piece.\n\nIt was a perfect gift for my friend.", "summary": "Prettier than the photo shows", "unixReviewTime": 1355616000}

I purchased anyhow, but will be returning it.\n\nThis Pax Trading \"Child/Kid\" hat will not likely fit ANY child.  It is a 59-60cm hat, which is about 23 1/2 inches.  For perspective, children's hats are usually 18-20\" for 3-5 year olds, and 20-22 inches for youth through grown woman.  This hat is a grown man's size.\n\nAside from size, this hat, when compared to the Well hat I purchased at the same time, is lacking in many ways.  This Pax Trading hat is very thin, and is made of very poor quality faux fur.  The Well hat is thicker, and is made from a much higher grade of faux fur.  It would be much warmer.  This Pax hat also has a very short chin strap for an \"adjustable\" closure.  The Well hat had a much better system for adjustment, offering greater flexibility for proper fit.  The Well version also has a cinch strap at the back of the neck to adjust fit & protect from cold wind whipping into the back of the hat.

They appear just as they do in their online photo.  They sit in a sterling silver cup and post setting which does not show when wearing.  And thankfully they come with a substantial back which keeps them sitting perfectly on the ear lobe.  Most importantly to me is that they are large enough to make a statement both with my sterling and gold pieces.", "summary": "Sleeping Beauty indeed!", "unixReviewTime": 1358467200}

I can't believe there is something this nice available at such a great price. I saw similar rings when we went to jewelery stores that went for at least 3.5k! I was hesitant at first to buy a ring sight unseen, but after another reviewer sent me pictures and told me that after months it was still perfect, my fiance and I went ahead and ordered it. And I'm so happy we did. Customer service at Natural Diamond is great. I ordered my ring in the wrong size and they put a hold on my order until I went to get sized at a jeweler. Word of advise, get professionally sized if you can. I tried to print a sizing guide from online and measured myself to be a size 11 when I am really a size 9. Don't worry if you don't see your size, ND store will size it for you just ask! There was a bit of a mix up in the shipping process but I still got my ring in less than a week. Even with the sizing delay. I don't think it was anyone's fault I ordered it during black Friday/cyber Monday craziness and everyone was a bit backed up. Also, don't worry about the clarity and color ratings. The ring is colorless and very shiny! The distinctions only matter under 10X magnification. To the naked eye it is perfect. Overall, great experience, will definitely order from Natural Diamond store again! Thank you Aviv for always replying back promptly to my many emails!\n\nOctober 2013 Update: almost 1 year later and I was loving my ring UNTIL...a diamond fell off my ring!!!! I am so upset!

I went to a local jewelry chain to get sized and an idea of what size and shape of diamond I may like. I was discouraged by how high all of the jeweler's rings sat and how big they felt.

At a size 6 the center diamond (0.5 carat) sits plenty big for me and the round cut looks nice on my long wiry fingers. The accent diamonds and white gold help the ring shine elegantly; I've received many compliments on it. I paid for half the ring myself and am so glad to have gotten such a beautiful ring, quickly and without hassle. We paid for one day shipping (with Amazon Prime) and it arrived on time!\n\nI can email you pictures of it on my finger if you want, just say so in comments with your email.

(Which in turn makes a noticeable bump under the corsage w/ all the knots & glue.)  Another reason why I wanted this one is because none of the pictures showed the metal attachment that so many other bracelets had... just the clear plastic plate to glue the corsage on.  Well, surprise!  It came with it.  The metal piece can be taken off fairly easily, but then you have to re-tie the ribbons to the clear plate, which takes extra time.  Lastly - & also very disappointing - is that the bracelets are very tight.  I've had comments on how thin my wrists are, so I'm not asking for extra-large here.  Just big enough where you don't think it's going to break when you put it on.  The bracelet is definitely not one-size-fits-all.  It's size small. So after all these problems, I cannot recommend this bracelet. :(", "summary": "Disappointing... 3 unattached bracelets + other stuff", "unixReviewTime": 1462320000}

In this case,I don't have to. This is the kind of tough belt you used to be able to buy anywhere,but just can't find in stores anymore. Believe me,I looked. Thick(about 1/4 inch!)beautifully finished solid leather,with big,strong snaps to hold the buckle on. Very dark brown,almost black. Exactly what I was looking for. I know this belt is going to last me 20 years.\n\nIf I have to come up with a gripe,it's that the cool black chrome looking finish on the buckle is starting to rub off,after only 2 days use,and only from rubbing up against the Formica counter tops at work,as near as I can tell. The worn spots are revealing a copper finish that's going to look pretty cool itself,once more of the black rubs off,providing that the copper doesn't wear off,to reveal what? Brass?\n\nAnyway,it ain't about the buckle. It's about the belt.\n\nIncidentally,even those double belt loops have come in handy. I followed the advise of some people who reviewed other Orion belts,and said to get a size larger than recommended,because these belts run short. Not so! This belt is way too long. I could cut it off,I guess,but with the thoughtfully provided extra belt loop,I just move it out to the end of the belt to keep it from flopping around.\n\nI'm just sayin'....I think them folks are fatter than they think they are ;D", "summary": "You won't be disappointed.", "unixReviewTime": 1370217600}

The older you are, the more children you've nursed, the more you will love the Bralief! Don't I sound like an add??? I have to keep buying them because I have three daugthers (all but one moved out of the house years ago) who always take them.  When I see a friend who buys a new shirt and her bra strap is showing, I tell her, \"you need Bralief.\"\n\nFinally, I love the little silky pouch they come in...it's perfect for packing my jewelry on weekend, business trips!", "summary": "Bralief is a fabulous product!", "unixReviewTime": 1379289600}

Yet you hate to throw them out because (1) they're adorable, and (2) they help to hold diapers in place!  Also, as far as the long-sleeved ones go, they're the perfect layering piece as the seasons change.\n\nThese extenders are awesome.  They basically increase the Onesie by a full size.  My baby is barely 2 years old, but super-tall and therefore already almost too tall for Gerber size 3 Onesies.  By scouring the Internet, I managed to find short-sleeve plain Onesies in that size, but forget about patterned or long-sleeve.  And yet I needed them.  Enter the extenders!  With these, I was able to use my baby's long-sleeve and patterned Onseies for 4-6 months longer than I otherwise would have been able to.  It wasn't just the money savings, which was great, but the fact that I was able to use the Onesies to keep baby's diaper in place until potty-training.

These are great for extending your onesies as long as possible so your child can get more wear out of his or her clothes. Especially if your child has a long torso, you are using cloth diapers, or if you are trying to extend the wear of your onesies because your older child has special needs. Its hard to find 2t, 3t, and beyond sizes in onesies, especially in the US.\n\nThese are great gifts for new moms, especially those who are on a budget. I have both these and&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Add-a-Size-Baby-Clothes-Extender-10-Pack-Onesie-Extender/dp/B002YQU6KC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Add a Size Baby Clothes Extender 10-Pack, Onesie Extender</a>&nbsp;and have been using them for almost a year now. They are very durable and have held up to all the washings and dryings and everyday life. The Gerber ones are a lot shorter than the One Step Ahead brand, but the OSA brand does not fit Gerber onesies so I am obliged to use both.\n\nThe Gerber ones only fit Gerber brand clothing, as previously stated in the other reviews. That is disappointing, especially since there are many brands which do not make a clothing extender, and even if there were I would not want to have to buy an extender for each and every brand. Luckily Babies R Us uses the same or similar style snap and these do fit some of our Babies R Us brand onesies as well.\n\nI think the price is great, considering how many times you can use them, how durable they are, and how hard they are to find! You can't get them in stores (or at least none of the stores where I live) and they are hard to find online too. Once in a blue moon you might see some on Ebay, but the price is never as reasonable. On Etsy there are sellers who sell handmade ones for all sorts of prices. I've seen them go for $13.99 for just one onesie extender, nothing special about it except that it was made with cutesy fabric instead of plain white.\n\nFor those who need onesie extenders for multiple brands, start saving your onesies that have holes or stains in them that your child can't wear. Then use the snaps and fabric from those onesies to sew an extender of your own. That way you will have one for all the brands you use. They are SO simple and fast to make yourself, even people who aren't good at sewing can do it. You can Google \"Make Your Own Onesie Extender\" and lots of mom blogs have done tutorials on how to do it yourself, and many techniques ranging from super easy to more advanced. Also since you can use your own fabric you can make them to match the colors your child wears, instead of plain white. I ended up making my own at night after my daughter went to sleep. I am terrible at sewing but it was really easy so I managed it somehow! I hand-sewed them and used the fabric and snaps from old onesies. I never had to buy a thing since I already had a needle and thread around the house. Every night for about a week or two I stayed up after my daughter's bedtime and watched a couple of movies while I sewed and ended up with 10 or 12 onesie extenders that go with every brand of onesie we use. I personally don't enjoy sewing but watching movies while I did it kept it from being tedious. And my daughter's daycare teachers complimented me on the onesie extenders and some of the other parents have asked if they can pay me to make some for them!", "summary": "Only Fits Gerber Brand, But Does Work Well", "unixReviewTime": 1361404800}

This guy was a very close runner up to the one I chose as my wedding band. The major reason I decided against it was that the corners of the little squares were ever-so-slightly sharp, so I could feel the ridges rub against the webbing of my middle and pinky fingers. (However, that means the cuts are perfectly straight and perpendicular, which is a sign of quality in my opinion). I thought that after a few days, the slight rubbing might make my adjacent fingers dry or raw. For some guys, this wouldn't be a problem, but I work at a computer all day and my hands aren't very tough.\n\nFrom most angles, the whole ring is a smooth, flat shade of grayish-silver.

The ring stays on but was not overly tight and became fairly loose when washing with soap, a 7 1/2 would be too large.\n\nThe ring itself is decent looking and is correctly represented in the picture.  Like most tungsten rings, it is darker than than other metals like white gold, and heavier. The width is exactly 8mm, thickness from inside to out is 2.5mm, and weight is 15.2 grams. There are no markings on the inside.\n\nThe only down side to this particular ring, was that the transverse decorative slots have a almost sharp edge that tends to irritate my adjacent fingers.

But so far all I can say is \"WOW!\".\nThese are great rings for a great price, and I'm very happy to have matching rings again (hubby lost his first one).\nThe inlay really shows up nicely in the light/sunlight... and the inner surface is slightly convex which makes the rings both a bit easier to slip on and more comfortable to wear.\nAs to the finish, at this time I look at it and it seems very high quality on the outer metal parts and inner surface, and the inner band is possibly plexiglass, Lucite, Perspex or some other acrylic/plastic.  As we are men, doing \"man stuff\", we'll try and take them off when working on the car, in the garden or even when washing dishes or getting into the spa.  Don't know what these activities might do to the finish and it seems best just to take care of them, no matter how inexpensive they were.

I had a simple tungsten band, but somehow it became very dull (NEVER scratched) and no amount of cleaning or buffing would fix it. I just got this one, so I can't yet speak on durability. However, I was surprised how pretty the carbon fiber part is. It has a 3D effect that you can't see in the photo, which gives a depth and movement that is very nice. Also very surprising is how comfortable this ring is. The inside edges are highly rounded (comfort fit) and it does not dig into my \"webbing\" at all. I have trouble with rings that have sharp edges, and this is one of the best - even more comfortable than the comfort fit rounded tungsten ring I replaced. You might need 1/2 size smaller due to this effect -- it does slide on/off much easier due to the smooth, rounded inside edge.", "summary": "Much nicer than the photo!", "unixReviewTime": 1387497600}

I loved it. Its twice as much as the IPearl mcover but I think its completely worth it. If you don't mind adding an extra inch to the total length of your laptop, I highly recommend it. I wrote a review on it, if you want to check it out.\n\nUnfortunately, the Macally case did not fit well in my current messenger bag.  I could squeeze it in but it stretched out the sides (with the case on, the macbook is almost 13in in length and the messenger bag was 12in wide) which left no room to add anything else. The next thing to do, logically, was spend another couple of hundred dollars on a new messenger bag.  Duh.  :p\n\nI really like Coach bags in general.  I find them to be a perfect mix of quality and style without going overboard on price and was hoping to find a similar bag to the 70283 that could accommodate the extra inch the Macally case added.  I didn't want a large bag, I wanted it as compact as possible but could still carry a few books along with my laptop and found the Kyra Messenger Bag. I liked the soft, feminine, lilac color.  It wasn't too ostentatious and the size was perfect.\n\nThey are very similar in style. The strap is a little narrower than the 70283 but its still wide and comfortable.  I do miss the double pockets in the front of the 70283, this one only has one large pocket across the front but its still functional.\n\nOverall, it has met my needs and I am really happy with it.", "summary": "A Great Replacement That Fits My Macally Case For Macbook Air 11", "unixReviewTime": 1358812800}

The overall fit is very good on these gloves.  I purchased the medium size, and I am very pleased with the tightness of the gloves through the palm and the perfect length on the fingers. The thumb however is a tad (quarter inch, approximately) too long for me, which is odd given that I have fairly long thumbs to begin with. The over length is not terrible and the rest of the thumb fitment is great. Knuckle perforations are well placed, and the stitching is very good throughout (especially in the tips of the fingers, there is nothing worse than awkwardly overlapped stitching at the finger tips!)\nI purchased the tan variety, and the colors are fairly accurately displayed from pictures here; as I expected, they are actually a bit darker and richer that the photo's show, and they do look great.\nI wish that they would model the gloves on actual hands, as they do look totally different. I will try to add some photos myself, but you'll have to forgive the quality, I'm not much of a photographer (or hand model for that matter!)\n\nComplaints:\nDents places their tags in the inside palm, and the tags are quite large (large enough that they will protrude from the opening of the gloves when worn), which ultimately forces you to cut them off. Because they're sewn into the leather at the attachment point of the thumb you won't be able to get a clean cut. The gloves are meant to be worn, so I am not concerned about a slightly ugly tag cut on the inside, but for the price its something to be mentioned.", "summary": "Excellent quality, and very nice fit.", "unixReviewTime": 1376352000}
