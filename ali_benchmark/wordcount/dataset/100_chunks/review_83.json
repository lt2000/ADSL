I'm 5'8ish and normally wear about a large and I read that someone my size bought one and it was good but a little baggy if anything. That was ok with me so I went ahead and ordered a large. (I should have know better, since sizes from Asia usually run small)\nWhen I got this dress and tried it on, it was definitely a disappointment. Not terrible, but not what I was looking for. It fit very snug, almost bodycon-like, and showed off my curves more than I wanted it to. It was also quite short in the front and the difference in length from the front to back was way more drastic than pictured. It also has a hole in it. I've decided to keep it for what it is, though, but I have to wait for fall when I can wear it over leggings.\nDisappointed for sure, especially since this item was a birthday present to myself. Also ordered another dress that I ended up giving to my sister for the same problems (minus the hole).\nI hope this review was helpful.", "summary": "Not bad, but not great", "unixReviewTime": 1472774400}

After having a child - for the ones that aren't lucky enough to lose the baby fat as easily - it's only comforting to enjoy wearing a swim suit that hides the insecurities, but still is flattering.

And the reason I am so picky is because my daughter has major opinions about what is an acceptable sleep sack. Now, I bought this for my sister who is expecting a baby in September, and we have no way of knowing whether her little one will be as opinionated as mine, but better safe than sorry! This sleep sack is the perfect weight--heavy enough to keep baby warm on cold winter nights if worn over fleece, footed pajamas, but not so heavy that it would be stifling on cool summer nights over cotton, non-footed PJs. The fabric is super soft, and the bear on the front is embroidered rather than cheaply printed on. It is about as long as 9 month footed PJs from Carters. I know that sounds like kind of a silly way to describe the length, but it just shows that a 3-6 month old should fit comfortably inside the sack with plenty of room for their toes (something that my daughter was VERY adamant about needing). My only complaint is that this sleep sack closes with 6 snaps instead of a zipper. When it comes to dressing babies, convenience is SO important--especially when your baby poops every 2 hours like my daughter did until she was 4 or 5 months old. However, the snap closures are only a slight bother. Overall, this is a great sleep sack in lovely, 100% organic cotton for a very reasonable price. I am quite pleased with this product and will definitely be buying one for our next baby!\n\nI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Perfect Fabric Weight", "unixReviewTime": 1461542400}

I ordered this dress in M and it fits perfectly. The material is a medium weight jersey, not too thin so that it shows every bump and garment underneath, but not so thick that it's like a blanket. It is quite stretchy so it contours comfortably but tight enough that it keeps a flattering shape.\nIt reaches right to my knees so it is discreet enough to wear to work but still sexy enough to wear out for drinks afterward. The armholes are fairly wide, so they don't pinch or get wadded up in your armpit. The back and shoulders are wide enough that regular bra straps are completely hidden but a racerback would fit nicely as well. The neck is wider than a crew but still modest.\n\nI highly recommend this comfortable, versatile and classy dress and will be ordering it in more colors soon!\n\nI did purchase this dress at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.", "summary": "Great for Summer!", "unixReviewTime": 1461715200}

This dress overall looks super cute. I love the print. Vibrant, looks just like the picture. The fabric is very thin and lite, which is great for being out in the sun but I recommend a slip underneath just in case it's a little see-through. Otherwise the fabric is very comfortable and flowy. Great summer or spring look!\nThe place where this dress went wrong is the size. I'm 5'7\" and usually fall between a size 10 or 12 dress, and buy medium size clothes typically. I went with a medium on this dress. The length surprised me in that it actually was a decent! Not super short, no butts flying out, but still shows some thigh. This isn't the norm being a bit taller when buying dresses so that surprised me.\nBut then there's the top. The elastic band looks TINY and stretches out to about my bust size (band size 34/36). However. This bust of the dress is not made fore someone with larger than a B cup, at least in the medium. I'm a cup C, and I couldn't get the elastic band over my boobs to sit on my bustline. And there was no way this was getting pulled on over my hips. Eventually I wriggled it down  and over my boobs... which is when the seam on one side at the armpit promptly busted open. So that was fun. I do not recommend in the slightest for girls with much of a chest!!

I looked at the size chart, and thought maybe it ran a little small, and ordered a medium. my band size is a size 34, and I usually wear either a medium or large bikini top. the medium is a tiny bit large, but not too much that I cannot wear it. the bottoms are a medium, I typically wear small bottoms, and they are somewhat big.

These are what we call grippy socks that allow your feet to stay in place without a ton of exta effort.\n\nPros:\n-Fit well\n-Grippies on bottom of feet and toes\n-Simple low cut socks\n\nCons:\n-Bit thick\n\nThese socks have come in very handy for my exercising efforts. The grippies on the socks work well and my feet did not slip anymore. I found the socks to very comfortable and easy to wear for a long time but overall I think they were thicker than I would have wanted from a workout sock. They are machine washable and fold up easy for storage. I have enjoyed using my new socks and my positions have all gotten better.\n\nI received these socks complimentary for my honest and unbiased review and opinion.

The fabric, albeit thin, is very soft and pleasant to the touch.  It's thin and unlined, but skims the body nicely.  The sewing on the dress is quite superb, certainly better than I expected it to be, so it is a pleasant surprise to not find any loose strings or crooked hems on a dress at this price point.  The skirt hangs well and is very full.  It looks especially darling over a crinoline, and I plan to pair it with a few different lengths and colors.\n\nRemember when ordering that this is not standard US sizing, so you may want to size up by one whole size.  I did that, and I found this fits quite nicely, so I would recommend that as a universal rule.  It's still kind of small in the chest for me, but I can tell that it would be too big elsewhere if I sized up even more, so I can live with feeling a little bit restrained in that region.  The fit of the dress is very flattering, though I have a larger bust and spill out of the top just a bit.  It's nothing too vulgar, though.  Even after a long day of wear it doesn't wrinkle severely, which is nice.  I love the detail that goes along the back -- it's almost a collar of its own, a little \"flap\" if you will.  It's a cute and unexpected detail to give a black dress a little more character, which is a welcome addition in my book.\n\nI'm overall very pleased with this purchase.  The styling is very on point for me and I love the added details.\n\nPlease be advised that I received this dress at a discounted price in exchange for expressing my honest opinion in this review, but that the opinions I have expressed above are entirely my own and are not influenced by that discount.

This is the size I generally wear in swimsuits, and it fits perfectly.\n\nI love this suit! It is well-made and very flattering. My only real problem area is my stomach since I had 3 children all very close together. The suit has an extra layer of fabric that really helps hold in my jiggle. Many skirted suits have a mesh or lightweight fabric that connects the bottoms to the top of the skirt. This suit has regular swimsuit material all the way up, and then the skirt goes over the top of that. I look like I have a flat tummy! And its not at all uncomfortable.\n\nThe tie at the bust is actually a strip of fabric from the inside and a strip from the outside that get tied together. In one of my pictures, I left it untied to show that (if preferred) the tie could be cut off to give a more modest look to the suit. I really like how it looks when tied, however. There are 2 rounded, molded cups in the bust that are not stitched down. They do move around when the suit is first being put on, but they don't move a lot while Im wearing it. I would prefer a teardrop shape cup for a more natural look, but these do give that pinup look to the bust.\n\nThe straps that tie at the neck are wide, which adds so much to the comfort of this suit. I also like the elastic at the top of the back because it is comfortable and doesnt roll.\n\nI would highly recommend this suit for style, quality, and true fit.\n\nI received this swimsuit for free in exchange for my honest review.

Over the years, the band has begun to wear down where the holes in the band is starting to get stretched and the leather is starting to show signs of wrinkling. But what I didn't really like was the visible white stitching on the band. While it really does give it a casual look, I prefer the stitching to match the leather. Well, these aren't real leather, but PU leather. Either way, they feel nice and soft, unlike some other bands I've tried previously. The ends where the watchband spring bars go in have a plastic tube in them. I wasn't really sure if I'm supposed to put the spring bars inside or if they were just placeholders to keep the opening open. The spring bar did fit inside, so I just kept the plastic tube in place. The band fits nicely and I wanted to show the difference (only took a picture with the top installed) between the old and new band. As I don't have a gold tone watch to use the brown band, I'll save it for now and maybe I'll get another watch later. These aren't the highest end bands, but they are well made and the stitching is done nicely.

There are a few pockets on the inside. One is even zippered so you can easily store your keys or wallet out of sight from others. The straps are nice and thick and will easily hold a lot of weight due to their size and thickness. The fringe, on the ends of the handle, is adorable and long enough that I'm not worried about the knots ever coming undone. The colors are very beachy feeling and the anchor really tops this off as the perfect beach bag feel!! I easily stuffed beach towels, a portable waterproof Bluetooth speaker, snacks and water for the day and still had plenty of room left for a book, my wallet, the keys and a few beach toys!\n\nIf you are looking for a quality beach bag that will fit ALL of the essentials and more look no further you will not be disappointed with this bag!\n\nI received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.

The handles/straps are made with a large rope that knots at the bag and is undone to create tassels.  There is plenty of a drop from the handle to the bag to be able to carry it very comfortable.\nThe bag is huge, I do not even know what to compare it to. I knew when I ordered it said XL but I was not expecting this size!  I have already used it to carry several things that I normally would have to carry in about 4 sacks.  I think it would really cute for an overnight/weekend bag, trips to the lake or beach, I can honestly even see myself toting items from the warehouse club that do not provide sacks.  The bag is very durable feeling, I had it loaded to the top and I had no fear that it would come apart or rip.  The look is very trendy, as the mint color and anchors are pretty popular in the area I live in.  So if I have not expressed it enough, I absolutely love this bag, I wish I had a small version of it as well, so I could use it as my purse, then I could take it everywhere!!

I live 3 hours from San Diego so I try to get out to the beach as much as I can in the summers so Im always looking for nice beach bags. I usually use the big reusable shopping bags you can get from Marshalls because I never see a tote bag that is big enough for my stuff, but those straps always break so quickly and the tote rips. I was nervous that this bag wouldnt be big enough, but it is!! I put my large Costco beach towel, beach blanket, wetsuit, sandals, and still had space if I wanted to squish in another towel or something.\nThe material is really nice, the bag part is like a softer canvas and the rope handles are soft too, so no worries about rug burn! The stripes are navy blue and teal with the same color teal band on the top/inside of the bag. The rest of the inside is lined with a nice beige material so its nice and bight inside, easy to find all your things. It has zipper compartment inside, about 10 inches wide and 5.5 inches deep, plenty of space for smaller items like your wallet, phone, & keys. The tote also has two open pockets on the inside, one measuring about 5 inches wide and 5.5 inches deep and the other measuring about 3 inches wide and 5.5 inches deep (this smaller pocket fits my iPhone 5 with thick case perfectly). The bottom of the bag is a bit cushioned, maybe about a quarter inch thick? I included a picture to show the cushioning.\nYes, this bag did come a little wrinkled but not even close to as bad as some of the review pictures before mine so Im thinking they have changed the way they pack these. The (not so noticeable) wrinkles in my bag are just from where it was folded (which should be expected since it did come in the mail) and are coming out easily on their own as I use the bag. I searched the bag over to look for stains (like one other customer had) and this bag had absolutely no stains.\nThe material is 100% cotton inside and out. The tag says you can clean this bag by wiping with a soft dry cloth, but I may try to machine wash in a garment bag in the future if I get it really dirty I honestly don't see why you wouldnt be able to, maybe just an issue with the rope handles but the garment bag should protect it. Ill update if I ever get to that point. I think Im going ot spray some scotch guard to the bottom of the bag just to make it easier to keep clean.\nI did receive a discount for this tote in exchange for my review, but I honestly love this bag!

I'm able to fit my soap, shampoo, lotion, toothpaste, toothbrush, q-tips, dry shampoo, make-up, makeup brushes and I still have room for more.

So you don't have to leave what you need at home you can pack all that you need in this little hanging case. The zippers are sturdy. The bottom opening is wide and holds a surprising amount of things. The hook is at the end of a tether that is securely sewn into the top flap of the case. The case has a handle so that you can carry it easily to and fro as needed. I tried the hook on several different items and it fits around a fairly large circumference. It can also hang off of an open drawer. It's one of those small and mighty items that I am always looking for. It doesn't take up too much space but it holds a lot.

I was actually quite pleased and impressed with the quality of the bag when it arrived- especially for such an affordable cost! I'm almost too afraid to use it as a beach bag and risk harming it or filling it with sand because it's so soft and perfect to use as a nice handbag or even possibly an overnight bag if you travel light.\n\n I got the navy blue anchor bag and the pattern is just beautiful. The exterior is composed of a nice textured yet soft canvas fabric with various anchor prints. The soft accent synthetic leather used for the handle, zipper trims and the exterior base of the bag is the perfect camel color to play off the navy blue and there are gold studs on the underside of the bag to prevent scuffing as well as a decent gold zipper across the top and inside of the bag.\n\nThe inside liner of the bag is a nice soft linen colored cotton. I was honestly expecting a very thin see-through liner as some other bags I've received off Amazon had but was completely surprised to find the liner of this bag to be rather thick, not see-through at all (even for the pockets) and of a great quality fabric. (I think this furthermore adds to the reasons why I don't want to take it to the beach and risk spilling lotion or what not inside). There's an inside zippered pocket with more accent leather on the one side and then 2 open pouch pockets on the other side of the interior. The stitching of the bag appears to be of great quality as well and there are no visible flaws or pulls in any of the threads.\n\n I think for it to be advertised as a beach tote I would expect the bag to be quite a bit bigger in person- it certainly wouldn't fit a decent sized beach towel amongst other beach essentials but if it were being used to carry all your other beach essentials alone without a towel or clothing then possibly I could see this working for that use. Overall I'm very happy with this tote and pleasantly surprised by the great quality and I definitely would recommend this bag!\n\nDisclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.", "summary": "Beautiful canvas tote", "unixReviewTime": 1470441600}

I saw this bag and fell in love. I LOVE anchors. I also love large purses. This bag was everything I hoped it would be. I love the small anchors in different styles. I love that it has a strong strap and can hold a lot of weight. I love that it zips shut. I love that it is huge inside and can fit all of my stuff AND all of my son's stuff. The bag is well constructed and while it had a funny smell when it first arrived, it went away within a few hours of use. The outside of the bag is canvas and the handle is leather (maybe pleather?). The zipper is large and easy to zip and unzip.\n\nIn the video I show just how much stuff this bag can actually hold and I have to say it is impressive even to me. I switched to this from a diaper bag. My son is still in diapers but I was sick of carrying around a bag that was so obviously a diaper bag. I am so happy I upgraded to this La Cle bag. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a large, cute bag that can serve multiple purposes.\n\n***Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.***", "summary": "Perfect for my \"diaper\" bag", "unixReviewTime": 1469491200}

I will have to make a small adjustment where I will have to cut the band and sew the clasp where I need it, or remove the clasp all together to sew in some similar fabric that would allow me to tie it. Not a biggie for me, but keep that in mind if you measure about the same as I do in that area.)\n\nOVERALL:\n- the material is decent and you can't see through it in well-lit rooms/sunlight\n- enough elasticity to be comfortable and give the right amount of coverage needed (do note that it's not super stretchy, but just enough to fit the size it's intended for with wiggle room without feeling constricted)\n- well-made and doesn't seem like it would come apart easily, especially the bands\n- the design is a modern *and* classy look that would suit teens and adults\n- with enough care after each wear, it should last for years\n\nI'm extremely satisfied with the purchase and plan to mostly wear it for casual swimming and activities, but I don't think you'd have to worry about any \"pop-outs\" if you wear it while being more active. This very same bikini has been added to a few online shopping sites (in only 1 or 2 colors) for this summer, so if you are wanting to get this, this seller is your best option for the price with the various designs and colors (as well as being Prime eligible).", "summary": "Really good material, nice style, comfortable to wear, and you can't beat the price.", "unixReviewTime": 1465257600}

Just looking at this dress makes you think of summer.  The gentle round\nneckline and tie is very flattering.  You can wear it tied or loose to change it to a \"V\"\nneckline.  It is sleeveless and features a three tier skirt.  There is a side zipper for\neasy dressing.\n\nThe fabric pattern is incredible. The color combination is very attractive.  The material\nis a polyester chiffon print.  The attached underlining is made from a nude chiffon.\nI was afraid that it would be see-through since both fabrics are so sheer, but that wasn't\nthe case.  Its just perfect.  The seams are strong and straight.  This is a very well\nmade garment.\n\nFabric care recommends dry clean only but since its polyester, I feel certain you can\nhand wash with a woolite like product and have good results.\n\nI simply love this dress.  Its carefree styling is effortless and beautiful.

However the bottom of this is a nice fit I like the skirt and the flair. The material is a spandex style so it would stretch to probably about a size 16 to 18 is my guess with the size I ordered.

When it came in I thought it looked like it was going to be way too small. I wear a size 16 or an XL, but the size chart said to order an XXL for a size 16. It comes folded in a clear plastic bag. When I unfolded it I though \"Oh no\" way to small, but it fit perfectly. it is form fitting like the photo. The material is a thinner spandex material so be careful what undergarments you wear under it. I recommend spanx because it a thinner more form fitting dress. It does show the imperfections. It looked wonderful with the spanx on. However, I work black and you could see the line of the underwear part underneath the skirt spanx. So, maybe just a skirt option. I'll have to do a work around on that one. Another part I did not really like is the portion that covers the bust area. It is double layered . It has a V-neck dress underneath a wrap around portion that goes from the right to left. It causes the flaps on the sides of the breast. that stick out. I tried different ways to get rid of them but they are still there. You can fold in the left side under the flap but the right side will always stick out so it looks funny. I left both out so it would be uniform. No one noticed or at least they did not say anything when I wore it. Maybe I am just to self conscious of my appearance. Actually, I just looked at the photo and it shows the bottom folds under the breast out the side so maybe I just wore it wrong. I'll have to try that again later. So besides that great dress. The color is amazing. I absolutely love it. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to others, especially now that I know how it should be worn.

The top does not includes any pads inside, so if you like pads you can always use some of your own since there are little slits that you can place your own pads in if that is what you like.\n\nThe top was slightly snug on me but that could be because I still nurse my son and sometimes the girls are larger depending on when the last time he ate was.

The material used for this bikini feels a little thin but it isn't once you put it on it fits nicely.

Usually, I am a medium across the board or a small if the sizes run bigger. My only option was to purchase a Large in this product. I was anticipating it to fit either slightly loose or perfect, judging from reviews that said to buy a size up. When I first opened the package, the suit looked pretty big just holding it up. However, once I actually tried it on, it does fit slightly snug. The issue is more so that the suit doesn't seem to be long enough to stretch the length of my torso - which is a rather small length. It tends to be tight on my shoulders; the material doesn't give much room to stretch and the shoulder straps are also positioned weird, but it looks exactly as I expected, so I have no complaints. I can stand up straight and be 95% comfortable walking around in it, but I do definitely advise buying a size larger than what you would generally wear.

I enjoy buying clothes for her, so I purchased this beautiful black Petrel woman's fashion bikini cover-up tunic to wear around our backyard swimming pool and patio. The polyester is soft to the touch, but still pretty durable. I expect this will take the wear and tear of the beach and still last a long time. My wife is 5 foot 10 and slender. The large size fit her perfectly with the bottom hem just below where a bathing suit would end on her things. The material is transclusent, but it still provides a good deal of cover-up due to the dark black color.  I expect the lighter colors would be much more see-through. The decorative material is quite attractive without being distracting or otherwise standing out too much. This would be perfect for boating, the beach, a luau, evening by the firepit or going to the pool. It seems to me that this item runs somewhat slim for a cover-up.  My wife is slender and it fits her perfectly, but may run slim in the waist and hips for some women. The large fit my 5 foot 10 wife just fine. I received a small discount in exchange for a fair and unbiased review of this product. I recommend the product as it is a very nice oversized chiffon stripe beach swimwear cover up. This cover up is transparent so I don't know how much sun protection it is going to give you. It has shoulder seams on top and is completely closed on the sides (unlike some cover-ups that are more like panchos). Other reviews indicated that it comes down to mid-thigh when standing up, but that is likely for average height women. Thus, I think you can judge that it will be long to long-enough on most American women. Bottom line is that it looks lovely and it is better than average quality for a very nice price. I received this item at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. This is so nice that I plan to buy one of the other colors as well. My wife love it.

And makes me look more like I do in my imagination as opposed how I actually look in real life when I choose wrong dress style.\n\nIt's super comfortable and thin. I have a bunch of cute slips in different colors that I throw under dresses so I can avoid the bra and shadows of my under things.\n\nI ordered 2 more in different colors. Please keep selling this and make more colors!\n\nThank you!", "summary": "I have my favorite dress now!", "unixReviewTime": 1469577600}

I picked the color blue because it reminds me of Pia Wurztbach's gown when she won Miss Univ. Hahahah! And I wasn't disappointed! I love its blueness! I normally wear Medium  with Macy's junior clothing but Small when it comes to women. I decided to pick the smallest size available (Small) because based on other reviews, this is stretchy and it is! If you are 130 lbs, 34b-34c, Small is perfect. For busty women but petite (<140), I think small would still do. Can wear a bandeau if the cleavage shows too much. As far as the material, it is so soft. This dress makes me feel so feminine. And I'm 5' 2\" ... The dress just hits a little bit more in my ankle without hitting the floor barefoot. Buyers did mention about the plastic thing on the strap. I personally have bad experience with those because they tend to break after washing. But I can fix it if ever that happens. I would probably just attach the strap directly so I can still wear this pretty maxi.  I received this item with a discount for my personal or unbias opinion about it.\n\nUpdate 8/6: Okay, I have to reduce my review to 4 stars. Why? Because I notice that the straps are also too stretchy. And since the fabric is heavy, it tends to pull the straps down and you ended up pulling the dress back up. I wish the straps were made of a  stronger fabric less stretchy since it's adjustable anyway. I'm kinda resourceful. If I see a fabric or string-ish straps that match this dress, I will replace it.

One nice feature about this dress is that the straps are adjustable, there is a small plastic ring that allows you to make them longer or shorter. With the straps adjusted to the shortest setting, this dress is almost not too long, but it fits huge everywhere else. There is a slightly fitted elastic portion under the bust, and if this part fit tighter it would make the dress look much better. I will probably give it to a friend who wears a larger size. I think it could look really cute on a larger frame,  but it just doesn't work for me.

It's the perfect flattering simple summer dress that I was looking for. It arrived after a very quick delivery, in excellent condition. The fabric is light and soft, but not see through and as the style does not hug the body very tightly, I don't need to wear a slip under it. It's very stretchy, so the L fit me perfectly (I wear a size 14 in dresses), in fact I could have probably gone a size down, so if you're in between sizes, I suggest ordering a size down. The dress has a low v-neck, so you can't wear all kinds of bras with it, unless you're OK with the bra showing a little. In summer I actually hate wearing bras, so it's perfect this way for me. Overall, it's a very versatile and super comfortable dress that can be dressed up or down, as you see fit.\nThe only \"issue\" I can think of is that the adjustable straps have white little plastic pieces, which is kind of weird for a black dress and it would have probably been better to use darker colored ones.

The neckline is a nice shape, not a crew but not anywhere near low enough to have to worry about it.  The shirring is a nice touch and is flattering overall although I found it bunched a bit near my armpits and I had to adjust it down.  Note that the shirring is only on the front, the back is flat and somewhat clingy.  For as loose as the shirt's front is, the sleeves are rather tight.  The material does have some give to it wasn't uncomfortable, just the exact opposite of the rest of the shirt.  I don't know that it would be comfortable on someone with larger upper arms.\n\nOverall I am happy with my purchase and think this top will work its way into a regular rotation in my closet.

Not all of the beads have this moon-like light, but enough do to make the bracelet eye catching. I took a picture outdoors. The blue cast in the photo is from the \"moonlight\" in the bead that you can see indoors or outdoors.\n\nIt is a perfect fit and well-made with multiple strands. I know how to make jewelry myself for a hobby but have not mastered elastic cord beading yet. This elastic is different than what I have seen and the multiple strands make me feel more confident I won't have issues with breakage.\n\nI plan on buying a few more bracelets from 7th Element. I initially chose to buy from them due to the great reviews and their prices are reasonable. The bracelet arrived right away and was packaged very nicely. The pouch that the beads are in is drawstring and has a very soft, faux fur in it that prevents the beads from scratching or damage. The pouch sits inside gift box.

All you'll need is a sewing needle and a very basic knowledge of sewing. Just add a few extra stitches to each side of the suit. This will ensure your ladies are a little bit more secure and don't go anywhere - picture included.\n2nd alter: The padding that is included with this suit... looks like the lady it was modeled off of had grapefruits for boobs. Simply remove the padding and cut each to resemble a more teardrop shape- picture included. OR!! If you got 'em, you won't need the pads at all.\nOtherwise, the underwire is a little funky, and might take some adjusting. Eitherway, its a very nice & attractive looking suit for a curvier woman.

A nice silky pair of stockings, that feels so soft and sexy while wearing them. The Open Crotch Sexy Silk Stocking Lace Socks, Pantyhose Sexy Thigh High Crotch-less, by Augymer, arrived on time, packaged for protection.\nThis pair of stocking is black and very much crotch-less. When I first opened the package I was a bit shocked, because I wondered what would be harder getting them on the first time, or trying to convince myself that its OK to wear these outside of the bedroom. Now being a Big girl like myself, these look extremely small compared to what I would normally wear. They did not look like they would fit anyone over the age of 5 much less some in the double digits. Still I tried them on, I did manage to get them on and positioned right so that my legs were covered, the waist was where it should be, and of course my female area was completely open. Now Im a female who trust her husband and his opinion, so once I had put on a dress and some shoes I walked out to the living room to see what he thought. Nice was his reply, not exactly what I was looking for but it would work. Now me know the kids are outside with friends, I turned to walk away, but as I did I lifted the dress and kept going. YES, he did follow because he could not believe his eyes, or the fact that I had actually put something like that on me. The opinion changed quickly from Nice to Sexy, and a few other words I will keep in my bedroom. Needless to say I do like these, they fit nicely, they feel wonderful while wearing them. They do have a silky soft feeling. These could be worn for very day wear, or a special evening in with your better half. I suggest the latter, but thats a call youll have to make for yourself.\n\n I received this product at a reduced price for a fair, honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "sexy time", "unixReviewTime": 1467158400}

I purchased these for a dinner alone which does not happen that often.\n\nI did not tell him about them and wore a short skirt. This also does not happen often as with six children going out is hard enough, but dressing too is a complete different story.  On the way there I simply grabbed his hand and showed him my new pantyhose. He had a look of something on his face. He wasn't sure what just happened but no longer wanted to go to dinner. Of course I made him and teased him for hours.\n\nLater though let me tell you he did not wait this time to take the pantyhose off. They stayed in tact, did not rip or run. They fit well but were a little smaller then I expected My husband said these are the best pair of hose I have ever bought. He loved him.

As many have mentioned, there must be something wrong with the way the vendor enlarges the picture for larger sized shirts.  This causes the nipples to be practically under your armpits.  The front view is basically just flesh colored and doesn't really make sense to others until you lift your arm and they say, \"Hey, what's your nipple doing there?\"\n3.

I showed it to a friend and she said wow that's beautiful.\n\nBottom Line:\nUltimately, I returned the product because it didn't fit my needs. The price is great for the item. However, in the end, I wanted something that was smaller, thinner, and with a better leather. My primary usage for this pocket is house keys. I think the lining would have held up well to protect the leather from the keys, which is a definite plus.

It arrived much smaller than I thought it would be and most of the time these type of shirts are way too big and you can size down one to two sizes and still be comfortable in them. Not this one...it looks small when you hold it up to yourself and when you put it on, you realize the very top of it fits well, but the bottom of this shirt is pretty tight and not very long either. It does look very much like the photo description and it is indeed made from the material stated, 95% rayon and 5% spandex, but it is does not feel quite the same as other clothing I have purchased made from this material. I am not unhappy with it at all and I will wear it. I just wanted to let other people know what to expect when they order these tops. The color is bright and true, exactly what you order, not off because of the screen or monitor, etc. The fit is much smaller than I imagined when I ordered this top and I would say it is almost US junior sizing. It is not way too small, just more fitted than you would think for this type of top. I can't stress that enough. I do like it and it is incredibly stretchy material so just because it is a little smaller doesn't mean it will not fit. My measurements are as follows for comparison: 43' bust or 38D/ 35\" waist/ 44\" hips...I'm 5'7\" AND 199 lbs.

This chain has already been pulled on by my toddler and passed the test. The colors are amazing. I love the \"diamond\" sparkly details to add to the beautiful piece. I love that it has stones all around it so if it rotates you don't have to worry about adjusting it because it still is beautiful on all sides. The chain does slide around on your neck and the clasp will end up at the bottom but what necklace doesn't do that? The only only only complaint I somewhat have is that the rings that you clasp onto are kind of small and hard to get just right, but otherwise it isn't an issue at all. I love this piece. It has officially became my most favorite necklace to wear, and I have a lot of necklaces!!! but I love opal and its hard for me to find opal necklaces I love so much.

I'm 5'4\", so the skirt is going to be hemmed, but that's to be expected with any formal dress for me.\n\nThe pleats on the bodice are nicely sewn, no bunching or lumps, all the seams are finished, and I would say for the price the construction is very good. The hem on the sheer outer skirt is not going to be hard to shorten, but the lining material is sewn so the seam is hidden. It's going to be a little trickier to hem.\n\nThe dress lost a star due to the cluster of sequins not being level with the waist line. It's not as noticeable when it's on and I'm moving around, but on the hanger it's definitely askew.\n\nThe fit is comfortable, right now I wear a 14 pant and ordered the 18.

The bottom fits pretty perfectly & I don't feel like I'm spilling out of the sides.  If you're smaller chested  it may not LOOK as sexy but it will certainly fit you much better.

I would call the pendant medium sized. The cross is about 1.4 inches long. I like this size because it is not too small. The cross has little tiny crystals on it. Look closely because each round section is not just a big crystal. Half the circle is actually metal and in the center is the tiny crystal. It gives the illusion of larger crystals. I thought that was neat. The end effect is a shiny and brilliant looking front to the cross. The back of the cross is just the plain metal. The loop on top of the cross that holds it to the chain is closed. That is great so you won't loose the pendant.\n\nThe included chain is about 18 inches long. It is a thin chain so it won't take too much rough tugging. It should be OK for normal use though. I like the sturdy large Lobster clasp.\n\nThis is made with an alloy metal. It is a very shiny and bright Silver tone color. I make sure not to get it wet or in contact with any sweat or chemicals so it will last looking good for longer. I don't have any metal allergies so I have no problems with alloy metals. But keep that in mind if you do have metal allergies or history of turning metals green.\n\nSo far so good. Beautiful cross design and nicely made necklace. Just as described.\n\n*****DISCLOSURE: I received this item free of charge to evaluate and review.

As a fashion blogger I am always looking for affordable stylish clothing to introduce my readers to.

This tunic is perfect for so many looks - you can layer it with a cardigan which I have a few times, you can also tie it up with a scarf, belt it, or wear it loose. It is perfect for hiding an imperfect figure especially belly weight!\nIn my photos I show a day to night transition - day time on top wearing with jeans and the top is just loosely hanging which is nice but then you can amp the look up for nighttime with a scarf tied around the middle and some added jewelry to give a WOW look!\nYou can truly wear this from day to play, office to night on the town!\nI own several tops from Timeson and all are well made, quality fabrics, and fit well - I even have quite large upper arms and I do not feel as if they are over exposed. If you have added weight in your belly this top especially will hide that. I love that it comes in a lot of nice colors too.\nThe pleating is super well done which gives the top an added flair of excitement!\nThis top can be worn with boots, heels, flats, even combat boots as I wore in my photos. Truly one of those pieces you will reach for often because you can totally change up your look. I love tops that allow me to do that. When you are on a budget and need clothing that can stretch the limits of your wardrobe it sure helps to have things like this.\nThe sizing chart is a little confusing but I am five foot three inches I weight about 140 to 145 depending on the time of the month, I have a 38 DD chest and larger upper arms - the large fits me perfectly.", "summary": "So easy to transition from day to play!

However, I think I received a defective unit. Upon receipt:\n\nPros:\n1. the magnet works\n2. the light lights up in various levels as advertised\n3. useful intention/idea\n4. shipped fast\n\nCons:\n1. safety concern: scary, loud, buzzing noise as if it could explode any time during usage. Louder as time of keeping the light lit increases, and as number of usage increases.\n2. defective USB/microUSB connector port: badly manufactured ports that have the metal parts disconnected and sticking part very slanted. This makes the cord impossible/hard to fit and function properly.\n3. defective battery: didn't charge after 24 hours of charging, even though advertised to be max 4 hours.\n4. annoying battery light indicator: Battery indicator light comes up randomly and no instruction on how to turn this indicator light on when you need it or off when it comes up bright randomly in the middle of the night.\n5. manual in machine-translated English, which could wasn't a huge problem to me in comparison to safety concerns, but is a cons after all.\n\nAgain, it is a product of very useful idea and intention, and I'd love to use it if it were safe and functioning, but I think any product with a safety concern I can't give it more stars than 1 or 2.\n\nso.\n\nit is what it is.\n\nI'd give it a 1 star for its safety concern but hey, maybe it was just a defective unit out of many functioning ones, maybe I was just unlucky enough to stumble on one that slipped through their quality contron procedure. So might as well give the small company some chance and not leave them the worst feedback possible I guess.\n\nBelow are just some more detailed elaboration on the cons listed above:\n\n1. The metal parts were not fused properly: the metal sheets were not even touching each other, making the ports useless and cannot function properly. The USB connector and the microUSB heads won't be able to fit in properly. The flat part in the middle of the port that goes into the USB head also wasn't straight, making it even harder to connect the cord without further damaging both the unit and the cord.\n\n2. This was the part that I was really not okay about and the main reason why I decided to start a return. Unit makes a really loud and scary buzzing noise when lit. Even at the weakest lighting level, it makes that noise as if it could explode any time. This is also part of the reason why I think I received a defective unit. Or, if all units do this, then it could be a design flaw.\n\n3. The unit never charges completely. I was charging it for >24 hours and the charging light remains red. While it is advertised (on the manual) to charge fully within 4 hours.\n\n4. The unit also lights up very, very randomly. I understand the blue light is to indicate the battery status of the unit, but it is a very bright blue light that lights up at the weirdest moments every other minutes. It looks like if you pick it up or change its direction after a long sitting, the bright blue light will come up. Sometimes it just randomly comes up while I hold it in my hand.

I have no idea what triggers it and all it says on the manual is how to read that blue light to find out its battery status. I've read the manual many times and even the embedded every once-so-often machine-translated parts where it isn't very readable, no key words related to how to start the process of battery reading was mentioned so I'm pretty sure it's not in there.\n\n5. about 30% of the manual is machine-translated English, this one didn't matter as much to me in terms of knocking out stars or not since it was just a flashlight and most of the operation was pretty straight forward, but it is a cons.", "summary": "Safety Concern.

The battery lasts a very long time, I still have not even ever charged it, and my kids keep playing with it, and Ive used it  and everything.

There are 3 different brightnesses that you can use. Also there is a red flashing light that you can set it to for an emergency. It also serves as a power bank, therefore if your phone (or other device) goes dead you can charge it with this emergency flashlight. I have been and will continue to recommend this product to others because it could literally be a lifesaver, especially the way things are in the world today. I want my mom to get one, I think that it would be a good thing for her to keep in the car also.

Emergencies happen all the time, whether on the road or even sitting at home, losing power and having no backup light just leaves us stumbling around in the dark.  I have lost power at home due to severe weather and only had candles as a backup light, having to carry one from room to room causes wax to drip and nobody wants wax hardening on their carpet not to mention accidental burns which I have done.\n\nThe Pomer Portable Mini LED  Flashlight/Lamp is compact, fits easily into a vehicle's glove compartment or even a purse.  It has four settings with the fourth being an S.O.S.  It is magnetized so it fits onto the top of you vehicle if you should breakdown so that other drivers can see you.  This is not the only safety feature though.  This would be good for the college student that has to walk campus at night.  As a mother to 20 somethings there is an innate fear of what can happen and my university student having this light with the at night lessens that fear, not only can she see better but others can also see her.  This also is good for the night time jogger or bicyclist.  Being seen and being able to see is what I really like about this product.  Like I always tell my children.. Safety first.\n\n- I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Bright and increases safety.", "unixReviewTime": 1462579200}

The cold shoulder look is not only in, but also super cute. I went with the reddish color and it is exactly as pictured  very deep red and very rich color. It will look hot with skinny jeans, peek toe boots, and some red lipstick. The white part makes it so you really don't need a necklace, though a choker and small studs would really complete the look. I love it! I do wish it were a little longer though. Its a very soft material and kind of flowy, meaning it is not form fitting, which is good for online purchases. I would order your size  not bigger or smaller. The price is reasonable and the packaging was nice with nothing broken or anything. I haven't washed it yet but it seems like itll hold up fine in a light cycle wash and then of course a hang dry. If you are a stylish fashionista, I highly recommend this shirt for you!

It might have been because I didn't tie/lace the shirt properly before trying it on, but when I went to the sink to wash my hands I had to bend a little and the chest area flap was completely loose, showing visible cleavage.\n\nBut overall, this is a pretty good top to have.

I'm loving how light weight these earrings are. I forget all the time that I am wearing them, which means they are not heavy and droopy. Very elegant with lots of bling. Totally my style & in the shape of eternity to boot. I just got a promotion and before the promotion I would wear a headset all day & couldn't wear any earrings in fear that they would dig into my neck. So I was so happy to start wearing earrings again now that I am off the phones...I wear these every day b/c of how great they feel on. Their lightness in weight and elegant appearance is so refreshing and rare. Usually when I wear earrings daily, my ears start to scab up, but not with these. My only request and con about this product is that it was either missing it or didn't come with earring backings to hold them on. If they were to fly off, I would never notice b/c they're so lightweight. I have had these for about 20 days now & I see no sign of color wear & tare, no flaking, no chipping, no color rubbing off, no turning the ear green = huge plus! Absolutely gorgeous for all occasions & go with everything I wear. I have attached photos of the earrings after 5 & 15 days of use.

I'm actually a true to size small so this shirt came and fit a little too loose on me which I didn't like. However this can be a good thing if you rock it with something high waisted. Next, let's discuss how the concept of the shirt was there but then it wasn't. I love how it actually came cropped with the thing around the neck. However what threw me off was the tag that is normally on the back of the shirt that was sewn in the front. Then, let's talk about the material. It was on the thinner side which I normally wouldn't mind if everything else was fine which in this case it isn't.\n\nFor this company, I would recommend, taking the tag off from the front.

The bag itself has a cushioned pocket with a velcro closure for a kindle or a tablet which is super convenient when I'm on the go with my kids. With so many separate pockets, it's easy to stay organized and I don't have to fumble around to find anything quickly.

The only problem right now is that my computer is too large for it (17 inch, I think), but I do usually use an ipad. Even with my computer being a bit too big, I was still able to fit the power cord in a pocket and an envelope filled with papers along side it.  The front pockets are great for pens, papers, scissors, and anything else I may need to add since I am returning to part time teaching next year. There is also a velcro full size pocket in the bag I can slip envelopes and papers in as well.  I am using it right now for my summer school planning and am really happy with the design, the navy color, and the pockets to keep myself organized.  I did put on the shoulder strap because I like to carry it cross body to distribute the weight better due to a rotator cuff injury.  I am very excited to use this bag and will pack it with sticky notes and more multi-color pens as I get closer to the new school year.

These shirts fit like juniors sizes, so if you wear much more than a small in women's sizes, you're probably not going to get a satisfactory fit (unless you enjoy feeling like an overstuffed sausage). I typically wear either a large in juniors or small in women's, and the medium I ordered initially was just a little bit tighter than I wanted.\n\nThe fabric is relatively thin, but soft and stretchy. I think it's going to be great for summer golf. The shirt has a slim fit, so if you like a little room in your shirts, this is probably not for you. It's much more feminine than traditional polo shirts.\n\nMy favorite thing about this shirt was the incredibly vibrant color. I'll definitely be buying more in other colors.", "summary": "Great shirts, but feels like juniors sizing", "unixReviewTime": 1466380800}

First off, I am 5'2\", 140 lbs, with 36B-30-38 in bust-waist-hip. I carry my weight around the midsection.\n\nThis dress is made of 65% polyester and 35% cotton according to the tag but I think there is a little bit of spandex in there since it has some stretch. This is a midweight pull-on shift dress with no buttons, zippers, or lining. The feel of the fabric is like a stretchy gym tank top. That being said, I think I could have fit into a medium since there is stretch, provided I wear some control undergarments such as Spanx. The XL was not too big but instead of hugging my body, it skims it with some room to spare. With the XL, I get a little bit of bunching around the small of the back and some flutter around my legs. All in all, with my size and body type, I think I would be most comfortable with the L.\n\nOn terms of print and color, I think this is a dress that can be worn all seasons, because while the print has some tropical elements in it, the colors range from blue to purple to black, so it won't look out of place in colder months. The print also camouflages areas that some people might feel conscious about--like their waist and thighs. It is visually lengthening and slimming.\n\nI think this dress is a win because it is forgiving, just pick the right size. It does not wrinkle so it is good to take on a travel.

The down side to the thickness is that it can get rather hot. The fabric feels smooth to the touch and even feels silky. The stitching is excellent. After carefully looking over all seams, I still do not see any rips, tears or fraying anywhere on it. Also, I love the non slip band on the very top of the control top. I have not had to readjust or pull the piece up.\n\nThe sizing is correct. I wear a size 6/7 pants size and the medium fit me perfectly. It wasn't so tight that it was uncomfortable, but was tight enough to keep everything in.\n\nWashing did not shrink or damage this either. I washed this in cold water on the delicate setting. Then, I hung it up to dry. Washing it this way did not cause any issues at all.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this. It is made well with quality thick materials. It does get hot in warmer weather, but it does work very well. I rate this 5/5 stars.

The boy short design makes it really comfortable, and doesnt rise giving wedges. The fabric is 70% Nylon and 30% Elastane making it very smooth and silky. The high waist of the shorts reach right up to your chest, covering up any fat near the area around your stomach. It helps slim and flatten your body from chest down. When using the body shaper, she noticed that the pouch on her stomach wasn't as noticeable. It accentuates her curves and refines her body. The shorts fit her pretty well and didn't run too small or large. She likes how it hugs a bottom and gives it some lift and shape. The only thing that my mom didn't really like about the shaper was the rubber elastic waist. On the inside of the waistband, there are two rubber strands that goes across the waist line. Whenever wearing the boy shorts for too long, the rubber waist band make her feel itchy and uncomfortable especially if she is sitting for a long period of time. Overall, my mom commentated that she really likes the shorts but wouldnt recommend wearing it for long periods of time. She like to wear it under her dress to firm up for social outings such as church and party. She likes how her friends complimented on how great she keep in such good shape not knowing she is getting a little help from this shapewear.

It's extremely comfortable and I do not feel like it is always \"riding\". As soon as I saw this Camellias Women's Shapewear Minimizing Hi-Waist Boyshort, I immediately ordered it. I ordered a size large; but, somehow it went through as a XL. I know this because on the size chart to order, the only available sizes on the pull down menu to order are S, M, and L. This specific Camellias Women's Shapewear Minimizing Hi-Waist Boyshort is a little loose; but, very comfortable. It does not have much tummy and stomach control for me since it is a little loose/large. It does keep my sides \"controlled\" and it definitely did not bulge over. However, it is very comfortable and comfort is important to me. I have the shapewear brief too I will admit that I truly like both types of cut. I would love it if the manufacturer has a nude shapewear so that I could wear it under my light colored dresses and white pants. Yes, I wore white pants (not leggings) quite a bit before. I would love to do that again.\nI am excited to finally own shapewear products so that I can fit in my little dresses again. Of course, I still need to continue to eat well and kickbox; but, at least I can have this for now and as a reinforcement in the future.\nI hope this review has been helpful to you and I attached five pictures.\nI received this product for my always honest and unbiased review and opinion.", "summary": "Love The Boyshort Style/Cut", "unixReviewTime": 1463616000}

The thing is, I'm somewhat...er...curvy... so the bodycon type dresses I often find are a bit to... revealing...\n\nSo Shapewear is my friend.  I find for my particular curves, the boyshort style is best because it blends the area from hip to thigh a lot better fo rme than standard shapewear and I prefer high-waisted for the same reasons.\n\nThis shapewear is what I would call a light to moderate control. In other words, you can still breathe in it but that also means that areas like a larger tummy will be controlled, but not completely \"tucked\" in. I have come to peace with my tummy (for now at least... this is a post-menopausal issue that I'm trying to lose but for now, it is what it is). So I'm not going to try to make it totally disappear.... but as you can see from the photos I'm uploading, these pants have smoothed over a lot of the lumps and bumps in my hips and tummy so that the lines are a lot more appealing in the dress I'm wearing. And for now, that's the best I can hope for ... at least, unless I want to wear a corset or whatever to pull things in more... and I personally prefer to be able to breathe while I dance...LOL....\n\nSo - I'm pretty pleased with these. I got an XL size and I'm a full size 12...almost a 14 depending on fit. To be honest, I wonder if I could have gone down a size...but I've found that a lot of these things on Amazon are a size small so I erred on the side of caution. Being so stretchy, if you are on the smaller side of a 12, you may go with a smaller size than I did.\n\nI received this for free in exchange for my time to work with this product so I can write a fair and honest review... however, I only accept review items I need so I can give them a real trial, and thus my opinions and experiences are a real and true reflection of my experience with the product.

Therefore, this review is based on her opinion of this product. I hope you find it helpful.\n\nFor reference, my daughter is 5'6\" and weighs about 140lbs. She ordered the blue, black, and rose colored tanks in the US large/Asia XL. She usually wears a medium in tank tops because she likes them to fit a little snug, but because Asia sizes run smaller than US sizes, she ordered a size up.\n\nThey arrived looking exactly as they do in the pictures. The colors are very vibrant. They seem to be made well and the stitching is done very nicely.\n\nUnfortunately the first thing she noticed was that they weren't exactly \"compression.\" They are, however, made with spandex so they have a lot of stretch to them.\n\nShe thought they were comfortable. The material feels somewhat like bathing suit material but they are still light and breathable. They are made with moisture wicking fabric so they pullmoisturefrom the body to the exterior of the shirt where it can evaporate more easily and keep you dry. She loves this feature!\n\nThey are not see through so you can wear them by themselves but they are somewhat clingy and and are on the thin side. So, for some, they may work best worn as a base layer.\n\nOne thing she would like to point out is these tanks are on the shorter side. Although they are slightly longer in the back; the front just barely covers her hips. She actually doesn't mind it at all, especially since it's summertime but she wanted to make it known for those who might like longer tops.\n\nOverall she is happy with them and plans to wear them a lot.

I tried just a waist down slip but the material is so thin the waist band of the slip showed. So I am ordering a full body fitted slip to fix the problem (I need a full body slip anyway so i I'm going to invest the money in it, but it does make this a much more expensive dress by having to add stuff like this to make it wearable). It's too bad cause it's a really great dress- just super thin. It also runs big IMO. I'm 5'1\" and 105 and ordered a S and as you see from the pics it's pretty big on me.

Plus there was a snag in the hemline of the lining itself, eventually going to cause it to unravel:((\nI liked the actual length of the cover up. I am 5'4, so it was a perfect length, if only the quality of this was a bit better. However, it was only $15 and for a swimsuit coverup, I'm not really going to complain.

Last year I learned the hard way that wearing your day to day slip-ons to any water activity is not a good idea, nor is it smart to not wear anything. This year I wised up and looked for water socks to wear in the sand or poolside.\n\nThe good:\n- These water socks are very comfortable. They fit snug, but not tight. I wouldnt go so far as to say feels like being barefoot, but they don't feel like bulky shoes.\n- They fit perfectly when using the size chart. For reference, I am a size 6 1/2 womens and I ordered a large.\n- They are cute. I like that they are basic black and are very low cut.\n- Price is reasonable.\n- Non slip surface on the bottom\nThe bad:\n- They don't last. I have had them for less than a month and already the seams are breaking apart. I have worn them 4 times, haven't used them on rough surfaces (I put my shoes on over them when walking to and from) and I keep my toenails short so I am not sure why they would be coming apart so soon.\n\nSo, as much as I like them, I would not re-purchase them nor would I recommend them. I break it down like this...I paid $9.99 for them, got 4 uses out of them before they started breaking apart, thats $2.50ish per use.

I wasn't expecting a top of the line name brand bag nor was I looking either. I feel for the inexpensive price I really will get my money's worth out of this. I have only used this one time as the weather is just about heating up. From my obsevation and first use I was impressed. The bag is perfectly sized for the Beach and to bring on our Boat. It is not too small or over sized. The outside canvas material seems to be good quality, the zipper works easily without it getting jammed up. The rope handles are very thick and durable where it held up with the weight I had in this. The inside is as I pictured it to be its lined and has a small pocket where I put my keys and a few little things. The design is bright, vibrant and beautiful for Summer. I was able to fit an over sized Beach Towel, Two bottles of water , suntan lotion a book and my Epi pen with room to spare. I already had a compliment on how pretty it is. One reason I chose this design is because the colors are bright so I can easily spot it from a distance if I decided to  take a swim. Price point was very affordable in my opinion and the seller shipped this pretty fast and arrived sooner than the estimate delivery date! I think it will hold up though the Summer mybe even next Summer as well I will update if it falls apart anytime soon but I really doubt it will. I  wouldn't recommend this if your packing a bag for the whole family as I really think you would need a bigger one but for one or two people it's definitely ideal.", "summary": "Very Durable and pretty Beach Bag at an affordable price.", "unixReviewTime": 1492473600}

This is a great example of a LBD (little black dress). You can dress it up with heels and some great jewelry, or dress it down with a pair of flats and a shawl.  The dress is snug, but I was expecting/hoping that it would be. The material is very pretty and very sturdy at the same time, and the metal zipper with a hook and eye closure at the top ensures that your dress will stay on and stay up. I really like the fact that the dress has a built in bra so that I don't have to wear a bra if I don't want to and and the silicone strip around the top ensures that everything stays where is is supposed to with no slinking down on the top. The silvery parts on the dress are woven into the material so you don't have to worry about losing stones everywhere.\n\nThe dress does have a very bubble shaped skirt, just like the picture, so if you are looking for something that will have a tight lower half on it you will need to look elsewhere. This dress is fantastic for those of us blessed with more generous tummy and hips as the bubble shaped skirt is very forgiving and provides excellent coverage. Also if you are looking to add a little to make your rear view as lovely as your front without permanently putting it there, this dress is awesome for that too. ;)\n\nI was lucky enough to receive this dress in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. Honestly, I have a tip to Vegas coming up next week and I can hardly wait to wear this!! :)", "summary": "Super cute LBD for a night out.", "unixReviewTime": 1465084800}

When you remove the caps to fill your bottles, the mouth is big enough to allow you to fill without making a mess. Then, there is a nice feature that allows you to easily identify what product is in each bottle. They have built in labels for shampoo, conditioner, lotion, soap, etc. that you just set to indicate the product within (you just unscrew the cap from the mouth of the bottle, then you push the silicone bottle out of the bottle neck/collar. The bottle neck/collar has little ridges inside and you just use your fingertip to turn it so that a new word will show in the little window. You will hear a click when it has changed to the next label). And, the cap has a special feature that keeps your products from leaking out until you are ready to squeeze and use. The big plus is that they are the perfect size for traveling - especially if you fly as they are TSA approved travel size bottles. Anyone who has ever had to deal with the security in the airports will definitely appreciate the fact that these containers, as well as the pouch they come in, are in keeping with the regulations. As an added bonus, the set comes with three matching silicone toothbrush covers. Everything in one handy travel pouch - I love it!

Wider and stable and was easily taken through security holding more than the bottles that were included.\n\nMy only concern is that they seem a little expensive for what they are.  Although, I have seen others of these bottles and wanted to buy them but found them to be ridiculously expensive.  So, it must just be the technology itself that makes these pricey.

One thing that is always a pain point is the toiletry.  Not everything comes in 3 oz. or less containers.  So you try to adjust the volume but yet they still freak out because the bottle says 6 oz. but only quarter of the item is in the bottle. I have had several not so happy experiences with our friendly neighborhood TSA agents.  I guess common sense is not so common.  So after my last fun interaction I decided to get something that will help me avoid the issue in future.  So this was the best thing I was looking for.  It comes with the bag and has four containers.  And you can change the label of each of the container by twisting the cap so it shows shampoo, lotion, conditioner and others.  That way you know what it is and unlike others that have stickers that fall off eventually, these don't come off.  Also it comes with toothbrush covers as well.  Which is great, because one time a while back one of the after shave bottle leaked and well I was not sure if I should brush my teeth or use it on my face after shaving.  Nothing like calling room service to get you a toothbrush before a big meeting.  Overall, this is a great kit.  I will be ordering another one for my wife and the kids because that way when we travel each of us has one.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.  Enjoy!\n\nDisclaimer: I received this product at a reduced price so that I would give my unbiased honest opinion, which I did. That did not influence me in any way.

I have a set myself and got another for my daughter.  I plan on getting more for gifts as our family travels a lot and I've noticed some of the kids buy the small travel bottles at the store but those are just 1-2 ounces and I like to fill them full and as soon as we return from our trip I refill and put away for the next trip all ready to go.  The reason I love these bottles so much is they are made of a really soft flexible silicone and this makes it very easy to squeeze the contents out.  I've had some of the harder plastic ones and they are very hard to get product out when you can't squeeze them.  These also have a little suction cup on the side of the bottle so if you don't have much shower space, you can place on the wall and just flip the cap open and it's literally at your fingertips.  They also come in white, light blue, light green, and pink.  Two of them say shampoo near the ring and the other 2 say conditioner.  It's small enough you won't notice if you want to use for lotions or other things.  This set also includes 3 frosty clear toothbrush covers.

It's not everyday that you find sellers who stand by the quality of their merchandise, and this is honestly one of the higher quality items you can buy for under $25 on Amazon.\n\nThese polarized sunglasses distinguish themselves from similar glasses that you can find in stores and elsewhere in several ways. Of course, the brand isn't quite well known in the US, so that's not one of its selling points. But its magnesium/aluminum frame (both lightweight, strong metals used for aircraft and the like), elegant yet functional design, and polarized lenses will give even top-of-the-line Raybans a run for your money. Oh, and did I mention these are under $25 while comparable name brand glasses are much more expensive?\n\nThe thing I love most about these sunglasses is that they actually block UV rays. Like, I've shelled out money before on cheap sunglasses, and was disappointed to find that they only made everything dark. The bad thing about making everything dark is that doing so tricks your pupils into dilating and letting in more light, and more UV rays, which is definitely not good for your retinas and bad for your health too. These polarized sunglasses diffract sunlight and do not let UV rays get through. As a result, things aren't that dark when you wear these sunglasses, and your eyes are really protected from UV rays.\n\nOther things I liked about this pair of sunglasses:\n- lightweight yet strong, thanks to the metal frame\n- flexible rubber/silicone/some polymer nose grips\n- are comfortable, even when wearing normal prescription glasses under these\n\nThey're designed in Italy and imported, but I'm not sure where they're imported from.\n\nIf you're looking for a pair of sunglasses to wear while driving or doing winter sports (the ice/snow will reflect sunlight and dazzle you), this is a solid option that you won't regret buying. I really can't recommend this enough.\n\nProduct sample provided at a discount or for free for review purposes.\n\nHere are some photos of the sunglasses and the accessories it comes with - a hard synthetic leather case, a black microfiber cleaning cloth, a black felt drawstring bag, and a hex screwdriver keychain (not sure why this was included, but okay)", "summary": "Awesome choice you won't regret", "unixReviewTime": 1464998400}

I will say though that this is certainly great quality for a replica and a great price! I received the bag more than a week before the expected delivery date, which was a pleasant surprise, and it just happened to arrive the day before a friend of mine died so it's been very comforting having this big bunny to hold onto while my real life bunny is living back home in another state and can only comfort me through skype.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons I bought this bag was because it has lots of room to hold things (which most stuffed animal bags really do not) and it definitely does not fail me in that regard. I can fit my water bottle (which is medium to large), wallet (which is on the large side), keys, makeup, notebook (as in a paper one, not a laptop), and tablet in the main pocket with room left over for a small snack or some pads/tampons and my phone, comb and clipper card fit perfectly into the small pocket in the back (it's also a perfect spot to put something like a condom that you wouldn't want being shown to the world every time you unzip your purse). Everything kind of slides down into the belly of the bunny so you can feel your stuff when you poke the belly.\n\nThe cuteness factor is also on point, this bag would definitely fit well with sweet lolita and fairy kei styles and oddly enough, it poses a kind of awesome, \"so off it works\" opposition in punk, goth and cult pary kei styles. My favorite part, appearance-wise, in the stock photos was the blush on the bunny's cheeks which the actual bag I received did not have so I ended up putting some of my own blush on the cheeks and while it brushes off and I have to reapply it every week or so, worked pretty well and looks very cute.\n\nThe material of the bag is very very soft and of pretty good quality, the lining  inside is a little thin/cheap so I would be careful about putting things with sharp edges like a mechanical pencil inside so that the lining doesn't rip. The zipper also seems a tad bit cheap so I would definitely recommend being gentle with it and not over-stuffing the bag.\n\nOverall the bag is so cute that I can't stop taking pictures of it and perfectly bridges my needs for practicality, novelty and style.\n\nSo many pictures below:", "summary": "Pretty Good Quality for a Great Price, Very Functional", "unixReviewTime": 1477440000}

I am 5'3, 135 pounds and I ordered the medium.  They fit me like a glove. I have been complimented every time I've worn these, even to the point that a younger girl screamed at me across the kids clothing section at Walmart to tell me she LOVED my leggings and ask where I got them. These pants also accentuate womanly curves and make your butt look phenomenal. Any lumpy areas are made smooth in these pants. I love the wide waist, it works so effectively to hide my muffintop.\n\nI've gone over every inch of these pants and the seams are flawless. What I really appreciate is the quality material. I have nothing but running pants in my wardrobe and typically even a hangnail can wreak havoc and ruin running pants.  I have scratched these, had my Chihuahua jump on them and dig her nails in, and there are still no runs. They hold their gorgeous colors even after half a dozen times in the washer and dryer. I'm also very grateful that the back of these pants is clearly marked. Seems like some pant makers have stopped doing this. And once in awhile I realize my pants are on backwards.  These pants have a different design on the back which helps, too, but I like having a tag in the back of my pants...less worry for me.

Coming from a self-proclaimed sock hater who avoids socks whenever possible, that's saying something!  I actually ordered these for my daughter but didn't pay close enough attention to the size when doing so.  As she wears a size 7, they were a bit roomy on her.  However, they fit my size 9 foot perfectly!  These socks are soft, comfy, and have the perfect amount of cushion to them.  It may sound silly, but I love the touch of gray around the ankle and on the bottom because it makes it easy to spot the match when folding laundry.  These stay in place well and breathe nicely.  A lot of low cut socks are almost too thin, but these are a nice weight for year-round wear.  They've held up nicely through several washes thus far and really seem to be high quality socks.\n\nLike you, I rely on reviews when selecting products to purchase.

Once I seen it I knew I had to get it for my niece. When I received it I was really happy with it! The material was really nice and it feels good! I'm sure it is very comfortable for the baby. She can't talk yet otherwise she could tell me haha! The shirt and pants are a little stretchy but not too much but it was perfect for my niece. She is a little on the chunky side but it still fits her great. Her and her mom really liked it as well. The black does look like a dark navy blue thought but I still think it is cute! Actually I think that I like the color more so now rather if it were black. The bow is so adorable and it is attached pretty well. I don't think it will fall off or start to unattach after a couple of washes, The little tutu is so adorable as well! She really does look so cute in it. There were a lot of moms who asked us where we got this outfit. For the price for this it is a really good deal. It is easy and fast to put on. You wouldn't have to fuss with multiple pieces of clothing! It can go with multiple things! It is very easy to accessorize with. If you have a little girl I would highly suggest this outfit! Even getting it in all colors, we definitely will. This seller actually has other outfits as well so I could check it out as well.\n\n*I received this product at a discounted price for an honest and unbiased review.*", "summary": "This outfit is the absolute cutest and we love it!

This very simple style feels ancient and modern at the same time. It is easy to accessorize. I usually wear something simple  bone earrings and a bone pendant on a leather cord, but have also worn a big necklace and wide, slouchy belt.\n\n The fabric is lovely, with a very slight sheen and slubby like raw silk. The weave is not really flat, like linen, it's more like gauze, but more tightly woven. It drapes nicely. It's good for warm weather, because it breathes, but you can wear it all the way from mid-spring to mid-fall. When it gets chilly, I plan to wear this dress over leggings and/or a t-shirt, with booties.\n\nThe color matches the photos. The orangey red is beautiful, and it didn't run. It has an ivory bottom layer, so I paired it with a long, ivory lace cardigan, and in cooler weather, with a drapey, ivory, waterfall cardigan. The green one has a coffee-colored layer underneath, so I echo that color with a beige gauze big shirt, like a light jacket. (Everything I mention was purchased on Amazon.)\n\nAs other reviewers have complained, the fabric is a bit fragile, and can rip at the seams.\nIt will also pill terribly if you throw it in the washer and dryer.\nMy advice is:\n1) Buy the appropriate size. I am 5'6\", 175 lbs., and it fits comfortably, but not baggy. I can sit in it, and reach, and walk, without straining the seams.\n2) wash it in the machine (who wants to wash by hand?) in cold water, on delicate, but first turn it inside out and put it in a large \"delicates\" bag.\n\nI bought a few of these. I did rip a seam, but it's easy to sew. I also washed one of these without taking care, and it got a slight fuzz which pilled so badly I gave up on it. I have been reasonably careful since, and enjoy wearing them.", "summary": "Lovely, simple, comfortable.", "unixReviewTime": 1503792000}

I will remove this review when you put pictures of the actual dress up. I'm sorry, but it is not the same dress and this is false advertising. If I could give it 0 stars I would just to spite this seller who paid for those other 5 Star reviews, and for having to continually ask them to leave me alone since I returned it 2 months ago.\n\n-the sleeves are really tight.  I usually wear an 8, but I ordered a 10, thinking I could take it in if I needed to, but the sleeves are still too tight.\n-the edges of the sleeves are not detailed like they are in the picture.  they just bluntly end (see photo)\n-the lace is not very elegant looking.  I wish there were more up close pictures, because other wise I wouldnt have bought it.  It looks cheap and hastily put together.  Around the waist where the lace is supposed to be tacked down, a lot of the tackings have broken, so there are several flappy pieces of lace there.\n\nEDIT: after looking at the product pictures again, I can now see that it is NOT the same lace.  Please look at my pictures for what the lace really looks like.  I have now changed my rating to 2 stars because of it.\n\nEDIT 2: after asking for a refund, the seller saw my negative review and was willing to compensate me $80. After accepting the compensation, they changed their minds and said I would have to return the dress to get any money. Do you know how much it costs to ship to China? $50 is the cheapest I can find so far. I've changed my review to 1 star because of this whole ordeal. Do not buy this dress. I'm pretty sure those other reviews were provided by a company who writes good reviews for money.\n\nPraises:\n-the skirt is fully lined.  In the picture where you can see her leg, it is because there is a leg slit in the lining.\n-after asking for it to be shipped ASAP, the seller got back to me and told me to expect it in 2 weeks (even though it says 3-5 weeks in the description) and I got it only a week later.\n-This is very long and will fit any height person, you just have to have it tailored if you are very short.", "summary": "OMG this seller is awful!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1484697600}

Just an FYI my high waist is 29\" while my hips are 44\". The product came very quickly and came packaged in a small zip lock pouch.  Like others have stated it says victoria secret on it so that's awesome, this doesn't say victoria secret on the top like the size medium does but it still says sexy little things at the bottom and the writing is in silver.  Just like the medium this does not look like a thong at all its looks like a brief but it fits more like an itsy and cheeky bottom.  So it's sort of a thong but not really.  Like the medium i did turn it around where the care and size info is in the front at my belly button and it fits more like a thong that way.  Still wasn't much difference for the control top when turning it around and it did give you more of a thong look which is good because that means i can wear it with some dresses and skirts.  So i would suggest doing that to anyone who is needing a more thong like shapewear. Since I went down a size the control top definitely does its job now it sucks in my stomach a little bit more than the size medium.  It also doesn't roll down at the top like the medium did. They're are comfortable and not too tight which is really good.  I am really glad i decided to order a second pair and go down a size because i feel like this one does a better job than the medium. To be honest the size small is a little hard to get over my hips but worth it to get that more fitted feel in the stomach.  I'm giving it 4 stars just because this is my second pair i had to purchase and had to go down a size to get a more fitted garment to be worn with certain dresses.  Also because it isn't a true thong like i was hoping for.  I still would recommend this to others who are looking for a control top shapewear bottom but would let them know to go down a size or to be aware its not a tight control top.

It's hard to see it in the photos but the top half of the bust has round sequins that shimmer when they catch the light. The material seems pretty durable. It doesn't feel like it's about to rip. The fit is pretty good...it should fit a broad variety of shapes and sizes, unless you are very tiny up top, in which case you might not have enough to hold up the bust part. But it should fit ideally size mediums but also small and even larges, depending on your frame size. Bottom line, this isn't a tiny little piece of lingerie that will only fit a size 2. I wear mediums and am a 34D up top and it seems to fit me fine. I don't look as good as the model, but hey, how many people really do? It does not come with matching panties.

I have enjoyed this aspect as it hides the fact that I'm wearing it rather well. I am able to get the firm control that I need without anyone knowing.\n\nThe sizing was correct for me. I wear a size 6/7 pants size and the medium fit me perfectly. It was not to tight where it was uncomfortable, but it was tight enough to give me the proper support.\n\nWashing did not shrink this either. I washed this on a cold delicate wash cycle and hung it up to dry. Washing it this way did not damage it in any way and I did not have any shrinking issues.\n\nThe craftsmanship on this is excellent as well. The stitching is expertly done. Each stitch is tight with no loose pieces of thread. After carefully examining all seams, I still do not see any rips, tears or fraying anywhere on this. The very top has a non slip line. This line keeps the control top locked in place. I am able to put this on and go about my day. I have not once had to readjust or pull the control top back up.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this. It is well made with quality materials. The sizing is correct and washing did not shrink it. I rate this 5/5 stars.

I ordered the size Medium, and it seems to fit correctly.\n\nThis shapewear is silky and comfortable, and it is similar in height to my Spanx. I really like how the panty area on the Camellias hi-waist brief is lighter than the rest of it since I don't need the support in that area. This also helps to keep me cooler, especially since were starting to have warm weather. The waist has the same type of sticky material (silicone, I think) that keeps it up as my Spanx. This one has not rolled down or left me feeling like I constantly need to readjust or pull it up. The quality is quite nice: no loose threads and seams are stitched well. I have washed this in a lingerie bag on a cold cycle and hung to dry several times without any problems.\n\nThis shapewear offers good control/support of my tummy. It also helps alleviate some of my lower back pain because it reminds me to have good posture. I don't have any unsightly panty or waist lines, although some fabrics do tend to not glide over it as well as others (just like with my other shapewear products). This brief does not have the hook and eye fasteners at the crotch so it does have to be pulled down to use the restroom. I feel that I am getting moderate to firm control with this product, but not as much control as with the maximum control shapewear that I have. Overall, it is more comfortable than my Spanx, silkier, and lighter weight in the panty area.

I usually wear a compression, or sweat wicking shirt underneath my work shirt during the hot summer months. The shirt came in a zip lock type of plastic bag with no damage or ripping to the bag and the shirt itself. I ordered the US XL and it fits very snuggly and is very good at moisture wicking. It dries pretty fast and I like the camo design very much. Good material and feels like I am not wearing a wet suit, but a shirt that is very snug but not too tight where it is hard to have movement in every way. Very happy with my purchase, and I will be picking up a fee more of these.\nFor my honest and unbiased review, I received this product for free or at a discounted price.", "summary": "Solid sweat wicking compression shirt", "unixReviewTime": 1468713600}

It fit as I expected after looking at the pictures and reading the description. I normally wear a L in US sizes and the XL fit comfortably. It is probably a little tighter than intended, but it isn't a close fit. I laid the T-shirt flat on the table and measured across the back of it as follows: Bust 20, Waist 19.5, Hip (hem) 21, Length 26.5. And I guess I should leave a disclaimer for the measurements being as accurate as I can achieve in home conditions.\n  This T-shirt is made with a lightweight and soft knit fabric with wonderful drape. Its made of 95% modal and 5% spandex. The spandex allows this fabric to stretch, but still retain its shape. The modal has similar properties with rayon and is one of the most comfortable materials to wear, especially on a hot summer day.\n I really like this T-shirt. It is a very simple style, with an interesting, asymmetrical neckline. It is very light and soft against my skin. The white fabric is somewhat see through, but it looks fine with a skin tone bra. The washing instructions are printed on the paper tag and state machine wash and air dry. I haven't washed this yet, but I am assuming that it should be washed in cold like most modal fabrics. This T-shirt is very comfortable and I have a feeling that I will be wearing this often!\n\nI received this item for free in exchange of my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Very soft and comfortable", "unixReviewTime": 1469404800}

This purse feels so smooth to the touch. It is the popular hobo style crossbody. The strap is adjustable, so the longer you make it, the easier it is to wear it across your chest (Crossbody style). However, you can shorten the strap and wear it over one shoulder as you normally would with any purse. Either way is comfortable, but I prefer the crossbody. I love that my purse is always close to my body. When Im grocery shopping, it is attached to my body (not in the cart as I turn my back to grab something). Also, with a young child, wear my purse across my chest lets me be hands free, so I can run after him, help him, pick him up, etc. without my purse falling off my shoulder.\n\nI have the blue bag. It is two toned with a light pinkish/lavender type color. The color is very unique, but the two colors mesh well together. They also sell it in black, brown, and gray (all having the two toned look).\n\nThe lining inside feels soft, smooth, yet durable. I can easily pull out the lining to dump out any crumbs, sand, hair that accumulates in the bottom of my purse. The purse has two tassels on each side. Yes, they are for looks (and seem to be in style right now, as I see them a lot), but if you pull them tight, the bag closes (drawstring feature). I don't normally pull mine tight. I leave the tassel draw strings fully stretched out and to close the bag, I use the interior magnet closure. I really enjoy the magnet compared to a zipper because its easy access. However, the magnet is super strong, so I feel confident that my belongings are safe and will not accidentally fall out.\n\nThe hardware is gold toned. The purse comes with a small blue zippered bag. It is long sort of like a pencil holder. Ive been using it to hold my makeup which I keep in my purse. This purse may look small, but I can fit a lot in it. My daily belongings which I keep in the bag are: the zippered case with makeup in it, my wallet, business card holder, small hand sanitizer, keys, cellphone, sunglasses, travel size tissues, chapstick, travel size deodorant, daily medications, and sometimes I can throw a water bottle in there. I love how there is a spot for everything. Everything can be organized neatly.\n\nInside there are two cellphone sized pockets, then there is the main space, then a zippered area with a gap leading to another zippered area. I LOVE the gap area because it is the perfect size to fit my sunglasses. Nothing touches them, so I don't have to worry about them getting scratched. Also, this purse stands up on its own. My biggest pet-peeve is when purses are flimsy and fall over. This one does NOT do that. It does not have the feet underneath, but it still stands up on its own.\n\nAll in all, this is an amazing purse for the price. It looks like a designer bag. It has a small logo stitched to the bottom of the bag (the two-toned side). Also, I love that I can choose to just wear it on the blue side if I choose. I highly recommend this purse for its beauty, functionality, style, and durability. I received this purse complimentary in exchange for my genuine evaluation and product review.", "summary": "two toned beauty. functional. stylish. durable. my favorite bag to date", "unixReviewTime": 1467676800}

I ended up putting this dress on my daughter for a photo-shoot to mark her 2.5 year milestone. The dress photographs very well and its a really cute style. While the dress looks great and was put together well, the fabric is low quality. It is so thin that you can see right through it and it wrinkles very easily. The blue on the bottom of the dress is just a ribbon sewn on (I was hoping it was blue fabric). I am actually nervous about washing the dress out of fear that the fabric will fall apart. I will be hand washing it later this weekend and hanging it to dry. Another down side was that the right side of the collar had a small tear in the fabric---it was easily covered up when I tied the bow at the neck but it was definitely a bit of a let down. This dress is really a 1 or 2 time use dress unless you have the time and patience for what appears will be a lot of hand washing and ironing.\n\nI received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review", "summary": "Low quality fabric BUT very cute", "unixReviewTime": 1464307200}

The issue I could see happening with a zipper is the long \"fur\" getting trapped inside while zipping. If you were frustrated and pulled it way to hard you could break the zipper or tear the material... this would happen with any zipper/fur combo. Just take you time and make sure the fur is pulled away while zipping. The cuffs are elastic like on  a decent jacket also. The feet are as they appear but open to the bottom so shoes could be put on, really a nice touch. No gloves but doubt my son would wear them if included. The mask is well, cheap and although it would work, it does not look like the picture. Not a real concern for us since we had purchased the \"roaring\" wookie mask... it makes for a perfect finished Chewbacca !!!! Sizing -  my son is 44 inches tall and not chunky, just a normal little boy of 5.5 y.o.a.... the small size fits perfectly.

The fit is small, I would never wear regular shoes this small. But I know that rock climbing shoes are supposed to be very tight (they're supposed to make your toes curl), which is why I ordered the 10.5 knowing they would be slightly uncomfortable from the reviews. They're as small as I can go without being very uncomfortable, so I'm pretty satisfied. I don't wear socks in them *gross*, if you're planning to wear socks then you'll probably want to go a little bigger. Overall: They are the fit I expected after reading reviews and knowing about climbing shoes. Going up 1/2 size worked for me. They seem like they are made out of good material. They have worked very well for me so far. I chose them because they looked like they're not made of leather, and they are not!

But overall the fitting was good.\n\nThe mesh part of the item is a bit rough but since its mesh it will be rough. The nonmesh region is softer to the tough and thicker. The item comes with buttons as well to adjust the amount of buttons needed and for ease of wearing. I ordered the black version so they are all black buttons and one button in pearl color.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this item as my wife liked it and was reasonably priced. Its a different style of wearing clothing and is nice to wear in summer months where it can be hot and also allows your skin to breathe through the mesh.\n\nI have received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review for the product. I am in no way affiliated with the seller or product. I write reviews based on previous experience with similar products. I hope you find this review helpful", "summary": "Reasonably priced blouse shirt with mesh", "unixReviewTime": 1465344000}

The lace looks and feels high qualityas does the rest of the blouse. The bare shoulders is a plus and the lace is just enough to help conceal bra straps.

In my experiences  with products shipped by Amazon, this seems to be the norm. Review disclaimer: I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review, and, as with all such review items, I used it long enough to get a feel for how good, bad or mediocre it is. If it seems that I only give 4 or 5 stars on my reviews it's because I tend to review only the 4-5 star items, which is why my reviews of samples tend to lean a little higher.  I will often use a product for a number of weeks or a month, in order to learn its operation and get a feel of its longevity.  I'm always open to questions in the comments section about it. I take pride in my reviewing process and hope it helps one in making a decision. I don't do the technical evaluations on a product, I'll leave that to the tech guys. I tend to choose to review products that I actually want and that I will use on a daily basis so that I can provide a thorough and honest feedback on the product. If this review has been of any help in decision making, please vote YES below. Thanks for your time.", "summary": "very nice, affordable top for all occasions...", "unixReviewTime": 1463097600}

So that's awesome.\nNext, I wondered if the dress might shrink and given these Asian dress sizes can already run a little small, I asked the seller a day after purchasing if I would be best washing it in cold or warm water and could it handle a dryer? I got a timely response the next day to 'please not wash in hot water.'  Though concise, it didn't really address my whole concern. Thinking I had much more time, I forgot about it and figured if care instructions weren't on the item, I would then ask for clarification since the reply was nice and quick.\n\nNow for the Cons:\nSo, being that this item normally sells for nearly $20 I was expecting a sort of thick \"business/office\" worthy material. Instead, once I opened the package, I quickly realized that the black material is super thin...almost like the material that most kids' Halloween costumes are made of...kind of silky thin like something you'd normally make a cape from...not a dress. The cuffs and collar on the other hand, are this stiff polyester almost material like some dress jacket from the 1960's...they don't match the weight of the black material which is so light so the cuffs and collar feel like accessories instead of part of the dress. Side note- the dress also had a strong chemical smell that Asian-based merchant's clothes can sometimes have. (not a fan of that smell..it's rare, but once you experience it you'll prefer not to again)\nIt was also surprisingly a little big, though truth be told, I do have a thin torso. For reference, I'm 5'5'' and weigh 118 lbs with 34A up top. I ordered a medium thinking it would probably be snug. Not the case! It is comfortable in the arms, but the sleeves are a little too long and the middle is a bit wide...kinda makes me look boxy.\nNow for the real truth about it, sure it's comfortable in that some ninja-turtle/superman kind of onesie costumes sometimes are. The main issue is that the dress LOOKS like a costume. It doesn't look like something you'd pay almost $20 for. I've ordered some pretty cheap dresses from Asian-originating merchants before and this is so cheap compared to what I expected. I am pretty disappointed as I really wanted a cute business dress and instead got a cheap costume for the next time I decide to dress up like \"Wednesday\" from the Addams Family.", "summary": "Pro's and Con's - Ultimately Not Worth the Money", "unixReviewTime": 1467331200}

The silhouette is nice too - I figure any time you wear something that really hugs the figure (and this one does!) you need to cover up a bit more in other areas, so the high neck and knee length give it the balance it needs.  The neck is not a problem to get in and out of as the fabric has a good amount of stretch to it.  Because it is so clingy and has a good amount of stretch to it, you would be safe sizing up.  I am 5'8 and think that the length on this is great.  Just to the knee.  The fabric is very thin, and while it clings to the figure nicely, it also will show every line of anything you're wearing under it.  I am running large in the bust area right now because I just had a baby and would recommend the size L for no larger than a C cup, again due to the thin fabric, if you are much larger than that it will stretch the fabric out enough so the pattern doesn't look right.  One star off because I don't believe this will be a long-term item as far as durability goes, and because it takes a really long time to ship as it arrives from China.

It can be worn to the office, church, party, etc.\n\nOverall: The fabric is soft and has a little stretch so it is comfortable to wear. It says it is a cotton/polyester but it feels almost like silk. It is well constructed and the design is very flattering. There are some difference between the dress I got and the picture on amazon. First, the black lace is not the same. The lace on mine was not as tall so the black pleated waist is higher than I expected. It is not a bad thing, just different than I expected. Second, the picture of the back looked like there was a white zipper down into the black area. There is no zipper on the dress so there is not white in the black section of the dress. A definite plus in my book.\n\nCost: This dress is just over $20 when you add in shipping. That is an amazing price for any dress let alone this beautiful one.\n\nWashing: I don't love hand washing clothing. But for this dress it is worth it. It only took a few minutes and then I let it dry over night. And no ironing needed! That is another positive.\n\nSizing : Using the size chart link's measurements I was able to pick the size that fit my body perfectly. I am 5 foot 10 inches and this dress does indeed hit me at the knee.\n\nRecommend?: Yes. It is a quality and beautiful dress!\n\n-- I received a discount on this dress with the aim to ascertain the features and drawbacks that may help you ultimately decide if it fits your needs.

The polyester fabric *will* dry quickly, which would make for a good swimsuit coverup, but it does not cover my rear end at all (Im 56 and average build). The color is vibrant and what I expected based on the image in the product listing.\n\nThe detailing at the neck adds interest, but it does not lie flat and has a protruding knot that cannot be removed at one spot. The blouse is surged, but had a knot of threading at the neck seam--I was able to snip most of it off. The fringe around the edges and bottom does coordinate with the neck detail. It has a couple spots of imperfection as well. And the stitching to make the arms is a single row of stitches that ends in a knotted mass of thread on one side.\n\nThis top could definitely work as a cover up, but at just shy of $17, I would expect a little more care to detail. And Im a bit confused because right in the product listing it states: Sold only by TXZTrade, other sellers are fake. Please note it and don&iexcl;t be deceived! That is not the name of the seller from whom I received this product. Nor is it the name on the tag stitched at the neck.

The material is not really chiffon, it actually reminds me of a very soft rayon bathrobe material. It is not sheer. If you are concerned about the 'one size fits all' of this item, it measures 32.5\" long, and the overall width is 42\" wide. The coverup is made to drape over your shoulders, it is all one piece without separate sleeves so to speak. If this bothers you a simple fix could be to add a small stitch in the middle of it to secure the front and back together, but I wore this all day yesterday draped over a pair of skinny jeans and a white tank top, and it did not bother me at all wearing it this way, just draped over my shoulders. I am 5'7, and weigh around 170lbs, and this is plenty loose on me. Normally I'd wear a Large or XL in tops.\n\nThis item is so versatile, you can wear it over a swimsuit, over shorts and a tank or over a dress. I have added two photos of two different ways I have already styled it. Over a white wrap-front top with distressed denim shorts, and over a flowy black dress with a strappy bralette underneath. The pattern looks like the photo, but keep in mind this is a hand-wash garment, so either hand wash or maybe washing in a mesh delicates bag on extra gentle may work as well...then hang to dry. Quality wise, all the stitching seems to be secure, and although it was really wrinkled upon arrival, there were no loose threads, holes, rips or defects. I would say the quality would be similar to a F21 item, maybe a little nicer. I hung this up in the bathroom with me while I took a shower and a lot of the wrinkles came out thanks to the steam.

The cotton had a good weight to it to provide enough warmth on cool days and seemed like it could hold up in light rain (untested).  However the jacket feels like it tapers in and it felt constricting around the torso.

I rated it as being just a bit smaller than expected only because of the width of the bust area. The cup size was fine for me (36C) and its well padded so it keeps the embarrassment of a cold nip from popping through while enhancing the curve of your breasts well. The padding also gives them a little lift so you have some cleavage, making it a sexy look. I really like the cutout sides. They show off my curves without showing my not so toned tummy, which I find a HUGE plus, especially since I've never really gotten rid of my looser 'Momma Pouch'.  The gold accents on the halter ties are just the right touch, too. This is a very good quality suit. The material is the same as most traditional swimwear I've every owned and it seems sewn very well. I have absolutely no complaints about the quality. I love that it's a nice blend of modest but sexy and doesn't have the boring look of a traditional one piece. LOVE it! It even comes with a little waterproof zippered carry bag for traveling and on the go. I'm extremely happy with it and would definitely say that the price and quality are both right on point. I do recommend it.\n\nI did receive this super cute swimsuit at a discounted promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes.

My husband couldn't bear to buy a tie for that much, so I am glad I was able to order this for him at a fraction of that price! The quality of this tie is stellar, it does not bunch up when you try to tie it, and if you happen to dirty it (trust me, a genuine concern because this is something that happens frequently with my husband), you don't have to worry about washing this tie, unlike silk ties! I really like cotton ties because it's got a preppy, younger feel compared to silk ties. I know my husband likes to diversify his tie collection.

Not a typical pattern for a tie, but I thought it would be a cute gift for mu neurosurgeon boyfriend.

It looks nice with many of his dress shirts, whether blue or white (they'r almost all a shade of blue, its his favorite color!). I think it might look nice with pink too...now to convince him to try a pink shirt!  I have to say the tie is much skinnier than most of his other ties. I was a little worried about this because  am not usually a fan of skinny ties. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it when he put it on. It didn't look too skinny on, and he was really happy.\n\nThe tie seems to be  a pretty good quality cotton tie. The stitching seems strong, as does the material. It doesn't look look cheap, which is always a worry when buying a tie you don't see in person first, especially when you are buying online.

I don't usually carry a purse anymore - I just bring a nylon shopping-type bag with me, along with this small pack and pull it out when I go into stores.

It is not long enough to totally cover my bum but it almost does & it drapes nicely in the back & on the sides. Plus the cut of the sides is flattering to my problem thigh area covering longer on the sides & front & with both the hemline & stripes angling across there it creates a nice slimming effect.  It looks especially good with all black underneath:  black turtleneck, slim black pants or pencil skirt with black tights and black booties with a long necklace & earrings.  But I also like it with a chambray shirt & gray cords or with jeans (blue or black) & a tee.  To be so inexpensive it is quite versatile & a great value.

It is fully boned and even includes a panel of matching fabric behind the lacing so there is not a gap.

The eyelets are secured within the layers of fabric, the boning is completely covered with padded fabric and does not show any signs of poking through. The inside is soft and free of itchy threads or seams. The ribbon is strong enough that when I cinch the heck out of my waist, it does not appear to be straining or in danger of ripping.\n\nI am 56 and currently about 135 lbs. My bust and waist measurements did not line up with the sizing chart very well, so I contacted the seller for a recommendation on size. After discussing my sizing with the seller, I ordered the size Medium, figuring I could use the ribbon to loosen and tighten as needed. I probably could have ordered the large, but this medium will be perfect when I finally lose my 5-10 pounds that Im working on. I have previously ordered corsets that were too large and there is simply no way to tighten them enough to look right, so I would rather err on the slightly tight side.\n\nI am thoroughly pleased with this corset, and I would absolutely recommend it.\n\nI received this corset for free in exchange for my honest review.

Soft elegant satin ties, These can be worn for personal at home for romance or if you are into cosplay this would perfect. It fits comfortably. You can loosen or tighten as needed.

This can also be worn though to keep in some of the bulges. Just tighten it up a bit and you are good to go.\n\n WHAT IS A CORSET?\nA corset is a garment worn to hold and train the torso into a desired shape for aesthetic or medical purposes (either for the duration of wearing it or with a more lasting effect). Both men and women are known to wear corsets, though women more commonly do. The most common and well-known use of corsets is to slim the body and make it conform to a fashionable silhouette. To emphasize a curvy figure. They reduce the waist which exaggerates the bust and hips.\n\n WHAT IS A BUSTIER?\nA bustier is a form-fitting garment for women, which is traditionally worn as lingerie.  You can also wear it as a push-up bra under a low-backed dress, or as a camisole for outerwear. The bustier can also be worn as a half-slip under sheer upper garments if a bold display of the midriff.\n\n OVERALL: it's an adorable corset beautiful corset that is designed to help achieve the much sought after hourglass figure, while help the wearer look fabulous.

I was really surprise that these magnets are like super magnets, they keep your shoes really tight. The process of putting the shoes on and through the laces was a bit different, but once I did one shoe, the 2nd shoe was a breeze. Slipping into your shoes with these is easy. Unhook the magnet, slip your foot it, then hook magnet, thats it. The way my shoes are is I keep the 3 lace rows in the front how they were and the 3 top lace rows inside the magnets.

Tyzon 925 Sterling Silver Beauty Shape with Cubic Zirconia Women Pendant 18\" Sterling Silver Necklace Absolutely beautiful.\n\n  I bought this to wear with a dress I had bought for an evening out. This looks beautiful. I have already tried this on with my dress haha. I have so many possibilities and this can be worn with just about anything. I love the craftmanship. I feel a lot was put into making this pendant and the chain is also great. It is not to thin or flimsy. That's what I was worried about. I have bought necklaces online to find that the necklace chain itself was very thin and flismy and often broke after the first time wearing. This chain is not like that and I am super happy. It is 18 inches in length. So it is not a tiny chain. The pendent is 27mm length and 13mm width. I measured to make sure. This pendant is Cubic Zirconia. It is a beautiful shade of purple with a small butterfly on the top. You get a great quality necklace WITH the chain at an affordable price. I have lots of yellow and white gold pieces as well as sterling silver. I have to say this exceeded my expections. I don't ever worry about my skin changing or turning green. This is made of 925 Sterling Silver and also nickle free and anti-allergic. Overall I would purchase this again. The quality is great. The pendant is beautiful. The chain very is well made. I received a great quality piece at a reasonable price that can be worn over and over again and with several outfits or occasions. I do recommend.

I debated for a long time whether to go for this piece or not. There are two things that drew me to it...actually 3.  First, the dangling crystal is a pretty shade of orange, which is my favorite color. Second, the word 'Miss'. I think it's a bit peculiar for a necklace to have such a design but it appealed because I have this thing about being called Ma'am. Where I work, I get called Ma'am half the time and while I realize it's a normal greeting not meant to be offensive, in my mind I'm saying \"No, I'm not a Ma'am, I am a Miss!\"  I'm also unmarried so I guess I'm a Miss in that way as well. At any rate, it's just a little peeve of mine. So I found it amusing to find a necklace that reads Miss and has an attractive orange crystal. The third reason? It's sterling silver. I try to get my silver jewelry in sterling whenever possible.\n\nSo that's what drew me to the necklace. Upon opening the box, I was surprised at how dainty it is. In my mind I was envisioning it as being a bit larger. Anyone considering this item should take careful note of the size. I should've paid more attention. I still like it. It's not that I'm not a dainty girl per se. I like all sorts of jewelry from the delicate to the large 'Look at Me!' pieces. I just had to adjust my perception of it. It's dainty and it sparkles nicely. The silver, including the chain, has a nice shine to it. The crystal is lovely. The chain is sterling silver as well and has an extender on it to adjust for length. I'll have to be careful with this one as this looks like the kind of chain that might tangle easily. But it's suitable to the pendant. It's the crystal I like best. It catches the light and is a pretty color. This is a piece that makes me feel very feminine, just like a Miss should feel :)\n\nOverall, I do like this necklace and appreciate the quality of it. I'm still glad I went for it, even though it's a bit different than I envisioned. It has a lot more sparkle and shine in person than it does in the picture.\n\nDisclosure; I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Smaller Than Expected But Still Nice", "unixReviewTime": 1463702400}

The description stated that a beautiful jewelry box would be included the box I received isn't even made for earrings, the foam only had one  inch slit close to the side of the box.  I couldn't even fit both earrings in that slot without them looking too crowded in the box.  The earrings are nice and have the neat feature of being able to wear them as studs or a double pearl ball set of earrings.  The studs are very nice and could be worn daily.  You could put them back together for a more sophisticated look, which is why I bought them for my daughter who is graduating from college.  They would look really nice for a job interview.  Overall they are a nice set of earrings but I had to get a different box for them to be presentable as a gift.

Tyzon\nTyzon 925 Sterling Silver Heart Connected White Cubic Zirconia Women Pendant 18\" Sterling Silver Necklace.\n\n  I bought this to just have a few extra pieces in my wardrobe. I can never have to many!!! This looks beautiful. It sparkles in the lights and truly looks like a real diamond. I have so many possibilities and this can be worn with just about anything. I love the craftmanship. I have purchased several items by Tyzon 925 Sterling Silver jewerly and I love the quality I get. I have yet to be disappointed. I feel they take pride in their products. I feel a lot was put into making this pendant and the chain is also great. It is not to thin or flimsy. That's what I was worried about. I have bought necklaces online to find that the necklace chain itself was very thin and flismy and often broke after the first time wearing. This chain is not like that and I am super happy. It is 18 inches in length. So it is not a tiny chain. The pendent is 20mm in length and 8mm in width. This pendant is White Cubic Zirconia.  This is a beautiful heart with a smaller rounder one attached. You get a great quality necklace WITH the chain at an affordable price. I have lots of yellow and white gold pieces as well as sterling silver. I have to say this exceeded my expections. I don't ever worry about my skin changing or turning green. This is made of 925 Sterling Silver and also nickle free and anti-allergic. Overall I would purchase this again. The quality is great. The pendant is beautiful. The chain very is well made. I received a great quality piece at a reasonable price that can be worn over and over again and with several outfits or occasions. I do recommend. I have attached pictures of the box in was received in as well as a picture of the necklace itself. There is also a picture of the back .

Runs large. I ordered the small (I have 27 inch waist and 37.5 inch hips) and will have to alter it slightly as there is much more extra fabric at the waist & hips than I need.  The 1+ inch elastic waist band closes with a large swatch of velcro and has an additional draw string (for extra security?).  The tulle layers are quite stiff and will work well under heavier fabrics. Well sewn with finished seams.  I was a bit puzzled when I unpacked it until I realized it was shipped inside out. Great way to contain all that tulle the next time I pack.\n\nBridal/formal wear boutiques are pretty proud of their under garments--at least their pricing makes it seem so.  I was stunned at the low price this is currently being offered (May 2016) and was even more blown away to be offered an additional discount by the seller in return for my opinion of the petticoat.

Color is not as rosy as I imagined but still very shiny, smooth, and attractive. Some other commenters have said that the edges were sharp but I did not have this issue at all. I like that you can sort of bend the metal a bit to fit better even though the metal is strong, and it stays in shape once you've bent it without seeming to weaken. The shape is like the picture on the person's arm, kind of loose and bangle-like. The three bands that came with the bracelet were good quality with no metal parts, I got one black one and two pink. The box it all came in was a nice touch. The only downsides are that the bottom of the groove has a weird texture left over from tooling it, I suppose, and that the hair band comes loose from the groove a few times a day and slips off to just be on my wrist. I would have liked it if the groove was a little deeper. Overall it was what I expected and I am happy I bought it.", "summary": "Sturdy, Shiny, and Simple Bracelet", "unixReviewTime": 1506038400}

I did like the shirt design though.  Not found of calling it Batwing sleeves.  It has very nice lace sleeves and was very flattering everywhere else.  I also am not a fan of the material...it is the polyester/rayon type that wrinkles ease and if you drop anything on it, even water it is there for the rest of the day and wiping it with water doesn't help, just makes a larger stain area until it is washed again.

THIS PARTICULAR SET RANKED #1.\n\n#1&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Milaca-Honeybee-6-Pc-set/dp/B01EJEZSSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Milaca (Honeybee) - (6 Pc set)</a>\nThis one is the lightest by far. It has three large ripstop nylon cubes for packing with breathable mesh, and two laundry bags (all nylon, no mesh). The cubes are deep enough for 3-4 shirts or 2-3 jeans.\n\n#2&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/PRO-Packing-Cubes-4-Pc-Set/dp/B01CCY69WE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">PRO Packing Cubes - (4 Pc Set)</a>\nThis one is the same brand as #3, but it has larger bags than #3. It is also made of ripstop nylon and has breathable mesh. It is a bit heavier than #1 and the seams are not as sturdy as #1. It also smells bad, but I think it will go away if you let it air out for a couple of weeks. The cubes are more shallow than #1 by about a third.\n\n#3&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Pro-Packing-Cubes-5-Pc-MEDIUM-Set/dp/B00SWTD0Y4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Pro Packing Cubes - (5 Pc MEDIUM Set)</a>\nThis one has the same comments as #2, except smaller cubes. Maybe this is preferable to you, but I am a 6'3\" guy with big clothes, and I don't want to have to fold them 6 times to fit them in the cube.\n\n#4&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Yepal-3-Pc-Set/dp/B011B6VLHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Yepal - (3 Pc Set)</a>\nAnother ripstop nylon set of cubes. These are light like #1 with breathable mesh. The seams are similar to #2 and #3, which means they are less well made than the seams of #1. The main problem with these packing cubes is that they are very small, and they are all double sided, so each cube has zippers on both sides with a compartment half as shallow as the cube. I probably can just jam one shirt into each side. Maybe they're good for socks and undies, but why are they all cut in half? Bad idea, IMO. Also, backside compartments of the cubes do not have breathable mesh.\n\n#5&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Hynes-Eagle-4-Pc-Set-with-Toiletry-Bag/dp/B01DPDNA6O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Hynes Eagle (4 Pc Set) with Toiletry Bag</a>\nThese cubes are the most well made of all of them. A higher quality nylon, and excellent seams. However what I don't like is that they are the heaviest, and they do not have a breathable mesh. Maybe the lack of mesh is an advantage to you, but I like the mesh because it keeps the clothes from getting musty. They do have well made air ports on the sides so the bags don't get pressurized. They have clear material on the tops that allow you to see what is inside each cube. Also the toiletry bag is not well designed. It's small and, while it has a nice hanger, it would be hard to use because there are too many small pockets. Lots of material and not a lot of space or accessibility.\n\nI bought all of these packing cubes with discounts in return for honest reviews.", "summary": "Best set of packing cubes of the five I ordered.", "unixReviewTime": 1464393600}

This is STEALING. You are willfully advertising an item for sale, accepting money for it, and then providing an inferior product!\n\nYou can't just click your heels together, keep repeating \"These glasses are polarized, these glasses are polarized,\" and expect them to magically become polarized! It can't happen that way. There is real physics involved. Physics!\n\nI posted previously on a similar pair of night driving glasses from another purchase:\n\nThese are NOT polarized lenses, and I am disappointed in the supplier and Amazon for advertising them as such. This is is deceptive, time-consuming, and costly to handle.\n\nThere's a very easy test for polarized lenses:\n\n1. Hold the lens over an LCD display so that you can read the LCD. A wristwatch (remember those?) works great.\n\n2. Rotate the lens 90 degrees.\n\n3. If the lens is polarized, the LCD display will go black. If you can still read the LCD, then the lens is NOT polarized.\n\nThese \"Night Vision\" glasses FAIL that test. These are not polarized, as advertised, and the trouble to return them costs me more time and effort than they are worth.\n\nWake up, Amazon! You can do better than this!

They are basically just slightly-yellow tinted glass (I did verify that it is polarized, but it was no help).  I was expecting the lenses to help filter glare and allow better detailed visibility during the night (or day) similar to my ski goggles, but that is not what I got. The glare from the Xenon Halogen Lights was not attenuated - it was just yellow now, not blue; the details of the road were not any better (I cycled the glasses on/off - no difference other than yellow, not yellow); arguably the details were worse as the glass caused some distortion as my eyes swept across the lenses - ultimately I ended up with a bit of headache from wearing them.  I would NOT recommend these as they missed the mark on performance completely.\n\nDelivery and Condition of Product:\nThe packaging for these glasses was impressive and comparable to much higher end products.  It comes with a beautiful travel case and glass cleaning wipes.  The glasses themselves are covered up in plastic protection pieces to indicate they are handled with care.  My glasses had fingerprints on the lenses, but they cleaned up quickly (I didn't run them through AFIS).  All other aspects of the glasses were in good shape.\n\nDesign:\nThe physical design of the glasses is great.  Fairly rugged design, feels solid.

So far, I have worn them 3 times. I don't dress up for work every day, but when I have client meetings, I try to look the part. I am very particular about my appearance, and do not like to look dis-shelved. I bought another set of shirt stays, from a different company, about a year ago, and two of the four have broken at the clasp. So I am trying this brand.\n\nThe shirt stays do match the exact appearance and description given by the page. The thing I like best about these stays is that they still have the rubber clasp. I like this for two reasons. 1, so that it doesn't destroy my shirts. 2, so it reduces the chances of it pulling off my shirt mid-day and then just hanging down by my sock.\n\nI was surprised by how heavy duty they were when I took them out of the box. These are no typical elastic material. It was almost \"jean like\" in feel and density. I thought for sure it would chafe me, or be too stiff on my legs and cause irritation. I was wrong. Not a single problem. Except when my boxer briefs ride up mid day, the metal clasp will pinch my leg. But this can be easily solved by re-adjusting my shorts, or by buying longer length boxer briefs.\n\nI prefer the 4 individual straps to the Y-straps or the stirrup-straps simply due to sheer versatility. I have used the Y-straps in the past, and depending on the shirt, I find that I cannot position the clasps in such a way to simply keep the s*** from riding up. It always seems to pull my shirts towards the outer sides, where the clasps are, and where the sock clasp is, and then my buttons have more stress on them, and pull my shirt in a very unattractive way. I simply don't like the stirrups due to the fact they are uncomfortable, and they show where your pant leg ends and until your shoe begins.  I like the 4 strap option so that I can use them in a myriad of ways, and attach where I need to, to best utilize me.\n\nAgain, so far I really like these straps.\nI will review again in a few months to make sure quality is holding up!\nI would add a photo...but no body needs to see that.", "summary": "and do not like to look dis-shelved", "unixReviewTime": 1469404800}

This aside I still wanted them to do the job and be functional cute, summer to fall, then winter into spring school shoes, also possibly be passed down to her sister, so I did shop around and read reviews.\nFirstly many reviewers said they ran way small (like a whole size), so I ordered a size and a half up, (which was only a half size bigger than her new school tennis shoes) so she could get the school year out of them. Well when they came in she they were way too big! so I don't know if they really run much smaller than expected, I would say they are fairly close to true to size,,,, these now will probably fit her two years!\n\n** Secondly the reason I gave these only one star, (and this is my bad) I read mostly great reviews 4-5 stars only concern was the size. BUT there was one reviewer that gave the only bad review, and that was about the quality, she said they did not even last one day on the playground when her daughter wore them to school, that the shoes came home terribly scuffed on the toes, like the toes actually worn off! Well THIS also happened to us! I should have turned away after reading that one review but I didn't, so I guess it is my fault.\nMy daughter also came home after wearing these shoes for the first time today, and the toes are mostly WHITE !! they are that scuffed. Not just scuffs, but the color completely gone! worn off ! And she swears she did not do anything out of the ordinary, just regular school yard play, and average classroom activities. Knowing my child I believe her, yes she is very active and does run around, swing, climb and crawl thru the tunnels on her school playground, but I've also watched her play and know she is not rough or excessive when she is playing.\n\nSo my review --- STAY AWAY from these shoes, these are cheap as far as shoes go, so I guess I got what I paid for, but even at almost $17 I thought they world last maybe six months. NOPE, unless you are only looking for a pair to last one day, and during that time your child will not ever be going outdoors of running/crawling/jumping/skipping around any, save your money, spend a little extra on a quality brand, I DO NOT recommend these!\nThese will not make it through the whole school year, I am embarrassed to let her wear them even one more day as they now look so terrible, and these most certainly will not last to be past down to her little sister :(\n\n(on any kind of plus side, she still thinks they are pretty, and says we can try to color over them a bit. And even though they are a little bigger than we wanted, she says they are comfortable, if that is any consolation)", "summary": "Toes worn off after one day at school, STAY AWAY from these!", "unixReviewTime": 1471910400}

These are Silver plated over a metal alloy base. They look very pretty. They are large earrings. They measure about 30 X 35 mm in total size. They remind me of large coins. I would say these are Medium weight. Not super heavy but not light earrings. If you have sensitive ears they might be heavy for you. I can definitely feel them on my ears when I move my head from side to side.\n\nThese have a very pretty design. The 2 leaves toward the bottom are decorated with little clear crystals. Then you have the nice open vine metal work on the rest of the earring. The edge of the earring has a rim all around. Please see my pictures to understand what I mean by that.\n\nThese earrings close with a latch that clicks closed in a little bracket. You have to line it up just right so it goes between the bracket and then just press down. I use my nail to push the latch up to remove them. The latch holds well and it has not opened up by accident on me.\n\nNice fun earrings with pretty details.\n\n*****DISCLOSURE: I received this item free of charge to evaluate and review.

Perfect for the summer and casual settings, you can use the bands to fashion the top in many different ways. The prints and quality are just as advertised and potential buyers must pay go carefully over the sizing information.\n\nThe shipping took about a month to North America. The item was fairly packaged and did not have any odor stemming from it, unlike most imported clothing. I was not impressed at first look out of the box as it seems to not have much to offer. Its quite a simple top made with cheap polyester-type material. However, I changed my mind later when I tried it on.\n\nThe material is not very high quality but considering the price, it is acceptable. The fabric has some stretch and is very silky soft. I wore it for hours and was quite comfortable the whole time. I have very sensitive skin and yet I did not experience any rash or itching after having the top on. The long bands also are quite stretchy and allow for a number of different styles in which one could fashion the garment.\n\nThe sizing is Asian standard BUT the seller has given enough information for prospective buyers to make the right decision. I usually wear XS or S and my bust size is 34 B. The medium (M) fit perfectly and just as the descriptions had promised. I must then say: if you have a C+ cup/bra size, the medium will NOT fit well. So, beware of that. Just read the sellers information carefully and you should be fine!\n\nThis top is very fun and sexy for younger women, also appropriate and even kind of sporty for teenagers. The prints are vibrant and diverse. This is a great casual outfit perfect for casual settings and many other purposes! Oh, and btw, it looks amazing in photos! I would recommend it, considering how low the price is.\n\n*** I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.", "summary": "this top is very cute and fun for young women and even teenagers", "unixReviewTime": 1471824000}

When it came I was surprised to see the material is a shiny material, not cotton like I was expecting. It almost looks like bathing suit material but it's lighter weight. I like that the back is adjustable to fit different sizes of people, it's a little tricky at first but once you get the hang of lacing it up its no problem. I got the white top with the eye print on it & feel like maybe you need a little something to cover your nipple so it doesn't show through. The strings are very, very long so I will be triming them down quite a bit. This top looks very cute on & my daughter thinks it's very comfortable. This will definitely be going to the beach with us.
