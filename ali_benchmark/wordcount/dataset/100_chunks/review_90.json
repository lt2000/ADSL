Overall I am happy with them but there are a few little things that could be better.\n\nThe mesh is very breathable and although I do not think they are actually water shoes, they can easily be worn to a splash pad or something, as they dry pretty quickly. My baby wore them to a water park and they worked great. I did take off a star for texture...it is SUPER rough and scratchy. The girls did not seem to be bothered by it too much but they are not the most comfortable thing to put on them.\n\nThe color is as advertised...we got the purple ones and the girls were thrilled. Very pretty shades of purple...they compliment each other well.\n\nThe arch support is pretty flimsy, also why only 4 stars.\n\nThe neoprene rim around the top is great...keeps the shoes on very well. I sized up too much for my littlest and despite being too big, they stayed on her feet all 5 hours we were at a water park in and out of the pool, slides, etc. and only slipped off a couple of times. My other daughter whose fit perfectly had no issues.\n\nLOVE the double loop. Makes them SUPER easy to get off and on...use the loop on top to help slide the foot in and then pull up the back with the back loop. Excellent feature. I especially appreciated after I tried to get a different pair of water shoes on the almost 2-year old.\n\nThey fit slightly on the smaller side but not awful. You might need to size up.\n\nCute style. They look really cute...not so narrow as other mesh shoes I have seen.\n\nNice, thick sole. Keeps their feet very well protected from rocks, rough pool bottoms, hot asphalt, etc. Also has good tread. We had no problems with slipping on the wet pool area.\n\nOverall, they do exactly what I need them to do so I am pleased with the purchase. I have some that are nearly identical and they keep my feet pretty cool, are easy to slip on, and fairly comfortable to wear. My feet have no arches so I need more support than shoes like these offer but kids run around in flip flops without problems where I feel like my feet are going to fall off from hurting so much so the girls have had no issues with wearing them for several hours at a time. If you are looking for orthopedic support, these are not it. But they work great for easy summer shoes. Disclaimer: I was fortunate enough to receive these at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review. I rely very heavily on the reviews of others because I do nearly all my shopping online so I strive to leave helpful feedback on both items I buy at full price and those which I have received for free or at a discount.

I had imagined, based on the seller's description picture, that it would hang loosely.\n\nI would have returned this shirt for a refund, based on the BRIGHT color that I'll have little use for; but I did receive this shirt at a discount from Leeberry, in exchange for my honest review, and for that price, I'll just save everyone the hassle.\n\nLike you, I base my purchase decisions on the experiences of others.

As soon as he saw this, it was instantly his favorite. He works in a home improvement store, so having a wooden watch is a really cool thing to have, and the design and size of this one is simply stunning. He says he gets more questions and compliments on this watch than he ever has on anything else.\n\nWhat we like:\n*  My husband says his favorite part about this watch is the size. He likes bigger watches and this one is the perfect size according to him. Big bold face that looks great on his fairly large wrist.\n*  The overall coloring. The Zebrawood looks absolutely stunning, and it is a real eye catcher. It still looks like wood, but the zebra look to it just takes it to another level.\n*  The time is easily read, and the Roman Numerals look great. It adds another layer of class to it, and the dials look great as well. Substantial and easily seen, even in the dark since the dials glow in the dark.\n*  Easy to set with the crown on the side, and it isn't so big that it hurts the wrist when you bend your hand all the way back.\n*  The band with the flexible wood links looks great. So professional and adds even more class to it. Also comes with lots of links, so its easily adjustable for almost anyone to wear.\n*  The foldover clasp makes it very easy to put on and take off with one hand.\n*  My husband has been wearing this every single day for over a week now, and it still doesn't have any scratches on the face.\n*  Comes in a lovely box sitting on a black leather pillow, so it would make an excellent gift!\n\nWhat we don't like:\n1) This watch DOES NOT tolerate water other than in very small amounts, like washing your hands and then drying underneath it. The wood will swell up and the links won't move anymore, and it may even affect the watch itself if it absorbs too much.\n\nOverall, My husband thinks this is a fantastic watch and he is thrilled with it. It was given to him as a gift from me and he didn't like that I kept it for a day so I could take the pictures and video for this. Its always his first choice watch and we couldn't be happier with it!\n\n**I purchased this watch at a promotional discount for the purposes of testing and reviewing, but my cost has absolutely no bearing on how I rate a product. I will NEVER give a positive review to an item that doesn't fully deserve it.**", "summary": "Has become my husbands favorite watch! He loves it!", "unixReviewTime": 1470787200}

In a short period of time, you can simply remove the links yourself to have the watch fit as needed. It can fit my very small femine wrist (a little lose when sized completely down) and it fits a little loose (what hes customed to) on my husband's very large wrist with no links removed. It has a metal band clasp, where the compressing strenth is about mid-range so not hard to undo but you don't have to worry about the black time set button or the clasp getting caught on something or bumped and coming undone. The numbers are set up in black roman numberals and don't stand out a whole lot to be flashy but all numbers on the face, can be easily read with average sight at proper arms length. The bright glow in the dark hour and minute hands are very easy to be seen in the day or at night. It is a big watch but not chunky or thick to get in the way of movement or clothes. Light weight and yet, not a delicate watch because of the wood they chose to make it from. This is not a dressy watch but it definately works for work, whether its a uniform, jeans or dockers. It may work with a suit depending on the suit. It will work for a night out clubbing, day on the golf course, enjoying a sporting event or dinner and movie with your special someone. It is not easy to find a watch that works well but is also unique looking...this one is both! Not only is it unique to well known brand watches, it's one of a kind since every grain of wood is one of a kind! I can't believe how they use texture and color to make such a statment in this piece...it's truly a piece of art! Packaging and presentation in the gift box makes it even more special, IF we wanted to give it away. While its designed for a man, it would still make a beautiful fashion statement when worn by a woman! I really don't see this watch as being age or sex specific. It really would make an amazing gift for anyone and has proven to be a great conversation starter. Oh, also, I have checked, normally watches like these can easily exceed $200 with other companies so give as a gift and they will think you have spent much more on their gift. I have attached pictures of how it came in the beautiful box and what it looks like on my wrist with no links taken off, since it is now my husband's watch. I received this watch for free for my unbiased honest opinion according to my own and my husband's experience with this beautifully unique time piece.", "summary": "Gorgeous time piece for a man or woman!", "unixReviewTime": 1470096000}

When it first arrived it looked a little bit like a hard leather that I am accustomed to\nseeing at the leather store. As soon as I held in in my hand I realized that the leather is actually soft and\nmoves very well. He puts this one on and it easily goes through the loops on his pants. The buckle is a nice\nquality heavy duty buckle that looks brushed. I like that the loop on the belt is not loose like others it makes\nit easy to keep it in place in the front of the pants.\n\nI received this belt to test at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Soft leather belt is great for blue jeans!", "unixReviewTime": 1468800000}

They look almost identical, block approximately the same amount of light, and are similarly polarized as the originals.  The fit isn't 100%, but it is very close.  A common complaint with other replacement brands were they are noticeably thinner and more flimsy than the original lenses, but from my naked eye observation, these are the same thickness.  Once in, I was blown away by their clarity.  In fairness, that is also a function of how scratched up my old lenses were, but still something to note.\n\nI will absolutely be buying another set or two.

I love wearing printed tanks to the gym.  I was pleased to find this tank, and thought it'd be a great addition.\n\nAccording to the size chart, I'd fit best in an XXL.  (I usually wear a medium, I hate women's sizing, it's always all over the place).  You can see in the photo how it fits me.  It's a little more boxy than I'd like, not like pictured on the model.  If I went down a size though, I'd be afraid it'd be too small, so this will work.\n\nThe material itself is very soft and has a slight stretch to it.  The design on front is printed on and I'll have to see how it holds up to a wash.  I stretched it out a bit with my hand and the design didn't crack, so that's a good start.  I might avoid putting in the dryer, but we'll see.\n\nOverall, a cute tank.\n\nI received this product at a discount for my honest review.", "summary": "Cute-Will Work for the Gym!", "unixReviewTime": 1468886400}

The colors are very pale and almost look bleached out compared to the photo shown. It will work for my needs, I just hope that it holds up since the material is thin. It is cute, I like the cut and the back opening that shows the black straps and tribal print, it is comfortable to wear. I normally wear a medium and I ordered a large based on other reviews stating the top is too small and I'm so glad I did. The top barely works for me and I am a size 34dd, if it didn't come with the tank I probably wouldn't wear it at all for that reason. The tank is a little big, but I expected that, and the shorts fit perfectly, I wear a size 6 in pants and am curvy. I will be hand washing it as I don't trust the padding to come out of a wash cycle right.

I don't know if that's clear, but the tank top is separate.  That's nice for me because I can cover my tummy now, but I have the option of a tanking when I get my figure back. The material seems a bit thinner than most suits, but I didn't see it in the sunlight, so I'm not sure about the coverage.\nThe important thing is the fit. Buying clothes online is tough, so I'll be as specific as possible. I am a tiny woman -about a 26 inch waist (0-1 in pants) and a C cup. I got a medium, which says 2-4 US. I'd guess that's the bottoms, and closer to a 2. The bottoms are a bit loose, but just enough to not squeeze anything (probably a similar fit to boxers on a guy.) The top made a stretching/ripping sound when getting it on and off, but once it was on, it covered my boobs well enough.  It's not secure like a sports bra, but I don't feel like I'd fall out if I cannonball. LOL. A small top wouldn't come close to fitting and a small bottom would probably be tight. Their tank top is nice and flows, but the shoulders are tight enough not to fall.\n\nI received this at a discount in exchange for my review.

Even if the shirt shrinks up any in the dryer it will still fit well. This shirt is very comfortable and looks great with a pair of jeans or you can accessorize and you're ready for a night out.

Its fabric that is cut and the edges are simply serged.  There is no fold over on the edges so the edges are thin.  The fabric rolls under on the straps and looks cheap even before washing.  One strap is larger than the other.  In addition, the I followed the size chart and the cut is weird.  While it fits my bust, the armholes flare out awkwardly rather than slouching downward.  There is an excessive of fabric in this area also making for a very unflattering fit.  The straps are also very long so I would not recommend for anyone under 5'3\" because you will pop out of this tank in the front and sides. It might work okay as a beach cover up.

I've used many sports tops, this one felt really comfortable to go for a walk or jog and I can later wear it for the groceries too. Very comfortable. I loved the color. It really looks the same as in the picture figure hugging. The material is very soft it's a mix of bamboo and cotton but feels like cottony to skin. It stayed a little cool in it which was very nice since it's really warm right now. I liked the V neckline, it looks very smart and it's not too deep.\nThe most impressive part was the arm holes they are so perfect as if custom stitched. I was however a little surprised on the color, it said grey but I was expecting a brownish grey like in the picture. But it's a pure grey grey!!! The length is perfect it comes a few inches below the waist line and I wear petites. I am comfortable with that length and doesn't ride up when sitting. The size is way too small, I think the sizes are Asian/ petites. But even for that it seems small. I wear a small/ Medium and still the Large fits really really snug. It does say fitted so perfect description. The stitching and edging are really awesome.\nI would love to see a few more colors in them since they are really good. I don't know how they will be in winter, it says they stay warm in winter and cool in summer. They are really cool right now. I thing they will live up to the expectations since they are bamboo and cotton both of which do good in both climates. Overall I'm very pleased with this Shirt. Would buy more if they are available in more colors since I already have way too many black t-shirts.\nI loved the fact that it has full shoulder coverage which makes it even more versatile and perfect for exercising. It covers more than 3\" on the shoulder.\nI received this product at a discounted rate to try and give my honest and unbiased review. I am not in any obligation to write just a positive review but just my honest opinion about the product.", "summary": "Small size, good quality, nice and cotton feel!", "unixReviewTime": 1469664000}

The slit is about 3 inches max (and I'm being generous, it's probably closer to 2 inches) below your crotch.  So if you do purchase this I would highly recommend a black slip so you aren't accidentally flashing everyone your lady bits.\n\nAlso the chest did not lay nicely.  The cut is obviously revealing, but as a 34DD it just didn't lay right and was pulling at the chest so that you could see pretty much my whole boob if you were looking at me from any angle other than straight on.  I got a size medium based on the measurements from the seller so maybe if I sized up it would be better - but because it's so sheer and there's no liner I don't feel like I'll like it even if it did fit better.

To day the least, this is hands down the most comfortable belt I have worn in my whole life so far. I've worn it with jeans and business casual attire and it looks great. Not to mention that the color of this belt matches most cognac, walnut, or tan leather shoes and watch straps. I almost thought about returning it for reasons mentioned further down the review, but ultimately, I couldn't do it. The following reasons offer a brief summary of what makes the belt good.\n\nPros:\n- The belt is really supple and It broke in very well after the 2nd day of use. Since then it's been very easy to bend and loop around my pants.\n- It feels very nice to the touch, it's not oiled like a dressy watch strap, so it has a slight suede to it even though it's not suede.\n- The buckle is round and comfortable, and it doesn't poke and stab my gut like all my previous belts have (both round and square buckles)\n- The color started as a cognac color and has darkened a shade or two since wearing the belt (indicator of real leather).\n\nCons:\nMy biggest criticism of the watch is about how there's no definitive way to tell what grade of leather this is. The description says full grain leather, but I figured that a company would be proud of that and rightly plant it on the belt itself like most other companies do. I have the $7 full grain leather belt from costco that even has the \"full grain leather\" stamp on it. A summary of other minor cons are below.\n\n- There is a loose stitch at the end of one of the buckle leather pieces\n- The buckle has no indent to hold the pin, thus it moves the belt slightly. It's hard to notice though\n- The buckle comes with some sanding and indenting already to give it a \"vintage\" feeling. I can see where people might find this off-putting\n- The underside has some sort of treatment to prevent napping, I would've preferred the natural nap as shown in the belt loop.", "summary": "Good for replacing department store belts", "unixReviewTime": 1506211200}

It fits him just right with the appropriate amount of belt overhang.  I'm sure there's a word for that.  LOL.  The buckle is nice heavy metal, and my kids think it's a \"Cowboy belt,\" even though it obviously doesn't have that style of buckle.  This is a great belt.

I unfastened it from my neck a couple of times to try out the sizing and the extender did somehow become detached from the necklace via a very tiny gap in the ring.

Did fine in the wash (machine-washed and dried), and didn't seem to shrink much, if at all.\n  I really like the length, the heather grey stripes, the drop sleeves and the fact that the sleeve stripes are horizontal while the rest is diagonal. <3 Also, it's almost completely opaque. <3 However, sadly to say, I feel this piece overall won't fit as nicely on a petite person (not on this one, anyway). I don't care for the way it fits in the lower-back. As I mentioned earlier, I do love the length, but being as it's more fitted it just doesn't look as well as it could. Also, the neckline was very wide on me, and I didn't care for that either; not on this particular shirt. I didn't notice the neckline seam being itchy, though, so that was nice. (The pictures are low-quality, but I do hope they may help in someway. <3)\n  The sleeves taper, and from my elbow to my wrist they were very slim (or very snug, I might say). However, they did stretch a bit to a more comfortable fit after wearing it a little longer.\n  If the front and back of this shirt were loose-fitting I would be totally okay with the cons, here. It could've easily been a favorite! <3\n\nI received this item in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.", "summary": "Unsatisfying fit, for me.", "unixReviewTime": 1472947200}

The cups are a pain in the rear - the padding inside folds up constantly and it makes the top very \"boxy\" looking. I have to constantly fix/re-adjust them.  All in all, the suit is pretty TTS and very comfortable.  I'm not generally a fan of the tie-back tops, they tend to pull on my neck. However, it is pretty comfortable and the straps are relatively substantial so they don't dig into your neck the way some do when you are larger on top.\n\nI don't have high hopes, however, that this suit will hold up much past one season.  Even when pulling it on you can hear the seams kind of \"pop\" and stretch - not indicative of a well-made suit.  But for the price, I guess I'm getting what I paid for.\n\nI DO love the bottom (under the skirt). It has great coverage unlike many suit bottoms, IMO.  They are little 'boy short' style bottoms and they don't ride up, fold, etc.  They are very comfortable and that's pretty much why I gave this suit 4 stars vs. 3 stars.  The bottoms portion of the suit is great!\n\nI am on the short side (5'4\") and the skirt comes down pretty long (just above my knee, really). Much longer than expected.  But it's good coverage so I can't complain!\n\nI ALWAYS wear a cover-up with a swimsuit (I'm so self-conscious) but I received some compliments on the top b/c I\"m not afraid to show the top of my suit/chest area (whereas a lot of suits don't give me full coverage/make me feel comfortable).", "summary": "Flattering suit", "unixReviewTime": 1470096000}

It is bigger than Jansport Half Pint and slightly smaller than Roxy Always Core.  Jansport has cover over the zipper but there's no lining and no padding.  The straps are webbing that can dig into shoulders when the load is too heavy.  It also has a key stay that both Mini Kane and Always Core don't have.  Mini Kane and Always Core are lined and have padded regular width shoulder strap.\n\nMini Kane is made of fabric used for most school backpacks; tough and long lasting.  The padding is on the backside, bottom, and part of the sides.  It is meant to protect the tablet.  However, the main compartment has no tablet sleeve or a zip pouch.  The outside pocket is slightly gusseted but not meant for any bulky item (won't zip up).  The side pockets have velcro tabs but the sewing is sub-part (mine is already unraveling).  If you have a big Android phone, the pocket may be too small for it.  Sunglasses without case is fine though.  The satiny webbing is also sewn on the strap that you can affix a biner or two.  Because the webbing is satiny, it is hard to have it stay at the length you desire.  To fix it, just use a 1\" safety pin to not having to adjust shoulder straps.\n\nIf you are looking for a fashion backpack that doesn't look like a school pack and is comfortable to carry, this is a good choice.  The dino camo is brilliant!  It is the reason I bought it (because I already have Roxy Always Core and Jansport Half Pint).  I just got a pterodactyl pin before I found this backpack.  It was fate.

Everything was on full display, and the seam in the middle of the shorts was dividing 'things' VERY obviously. (Google 'moose knuckle' if you're unsure what I'm trying to allude to.)

Yikes!\n\nUnfortunately I ended up returning both pairs, which was disappointing because they were a great price.\nAs an addicted Amazon buyer, I rely on real people's opinions to make educated decisions about what items are worth it to spend my hard-earned money on.

The material thickness is consistent throughout the garment without a distinct waist band, so these leggings are probably not the best to wear for high impact or movement intensive activities.  They are definitely perfect for yoga, though!\n\nI purchased these leggings at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.

Overall I am happy with them but there are a few little things that could be better.\n\nThe mesh is very breathable and although I do not think they are actually water shoes, they can easily be worn to a splash pad or something, as they dry pretty quickly. My baby wore them to a water park and they worked great. I did take off a star for texture...it is SUPER rough and scratchy. The girls did not seem to be bothered by it too much but they are not the most comfortable thing to put on them.\n\nThe color is as advertised...we got the purple ones and the girls were thrilled. Very pretty shades of purple...they compliment each other well.\n\nThe arch support is pretty flimsy, also why only 4 stars.\n\nThe neoprene rim around the top is great...keeps the shoes on very well. I sized up too much for my littlest and despite being too big, they stayed on her feet all 5 hours we were at a water park in and out of the pool, slides, etc. and only slipped off a couple of times. My other daughter whose fit perfectly had no issues.\n\nLOVE the double loop. Makes them SUPER easy to get off and on...use the loop on top to help slide the foot in and then pull up the back with the back loop. Excellent feature. I especially appreciated after I tried to get a different pair of water shoes on the almost 2-year old.\n\nThey fit slightly on the smaller side but not awful. You might need to size up.\n\nCute style. They look really cute...not so narrow as other mesh shoes I have seen.\n\nNice, thick sole. Keeps their feet very well protected from rocks, rough pool bottoms, hot asphalt, etc. Also has good tread. We had no problems with slipping on the wet pool area.\n\nOverall, they do exactly what I need them to do so I am pleased with the purchase. I have some that are nearly identical and they keep my feet pretty cool, are easy to slip on, and fairly comfortable to wear. My feet have no arches so I need more support than shoes like these offer but kids run around in flip flops without problems where I feel like my feet are going to fall off from hurting so much so the girls have had no issues with wearing them for several hours at a time. If you are looking for orthopedic support, these are not it. But they work great for easy summer shoes.

I rely very heavily on the reviews of others because I do nearly all my shopping online so I strive to leave helpful feedback on both items I buy at full price and those which I have received for free or at a discount.

As soon as he saw this, it was instantly his favorite. He works in a home improvement store, so having a wooden watch is a really cool thing to have, and the design and size of this one is simply stunning. He says he gets more questions and compliments on this watch than he ever has on anything else.\n\nWhat we like:\n*  My husband says his favorite part about this watch is the size. He likes bigger watches and this one is the perfect size according to him. Big bold face that looks great on his fairly large wrist.\n*  The overall coloring. The Zebrawood looks absolutely stunning, and it is a real eye catcher. It still looks like wood, but the zebra look to it just takes it to another level.\n*  The time is easily read, and the Roman Numerals look great. It adds another layer of class to it, and the dials look great as well. Substantial and easily seen, even in the dark since the dials glow in the dark.\n*  Easy to set with the crown on the side, and it isn't so big that it hurts the wrist when you bend your hand all the way back.\n*  The band with the flexible wood links looks great. So professional and adds even more class to it. Also comes with lots of links, so its easily adjustable for almost anyone to wear.\n*  The foldover clasp makes it very easy to put on and take off with one hand.\n*  My husband has been wearing this every single day for over a week now, and it still doesn't have any scratches on the face.\n*  Comes in a lovely box sitting on a black leather pillow, so it would make an excellent gift!\n\nWhat we don't like:\n1) This watch DOES NOT tolerate water other than in very small amounts, like washing your hands and then drying underneath it. The wood will swell up and the links won't move anymore, and it may even affect the watch itself if it absorbs too much.\n\nOverall, My husband thinks this is a fantastic watch and he is thrilled with it. It was given to him as a gift from me and he didn't like that I kept it for a day so I could take the pictures and video for this. Its always his first choice watch and we couldn't be happier with it!\n\n**I purchased this watch at a promotional discount for the purposes of testing and reviewing, but my cost has absolutely no bearing on how I rate a product. I will NEVER give a positive review to an item that doesn't fully deserve it.**", "summary": "Has become my husbands favorite watch! He loves it!", "unixReviewTime": 1470787200}

In a short period of time, you can simply remove the links yourself to have the watch fit as needed. It can fit my very small femine wrist (a little lose when sized completely down) and it fits a little loose (what hes customed to) on my husband's very large wrist with no links removed. It has a metal band clasp, where the compressing strenth is about mid-range so not hard to undo but you don't have to worry about the black time set button or the clasp getting caught on something or bumped and coming undone. The numbers are set up in black roman numberals and don't stand out a whole lot to be flashy but all numbers on the face, can be easily read with average sight at proper arms length. The bright glow in the dark hour and minute hands are very easy to be seen in the day or at night. It is a big watch but not chunky or thick to get in the way of movement or clothes. Light weight and yet, not a delicate watch because of the wood they chose to make it from. This is not a dressy watch but it definately works for work, whether its a uniform, jeans or dockers. It may work with a suit depending on the suit. It will work for a night out clubbing, day on the golf course, enjoying a sporting event or dinner and movie with your special someone. It is not easy to find a watch that works well but is also unique looking...this one is both! Not only is it unique to well known brand watches, it's one of a kind since every grain of wood is one of a kind! I can't believe how they use texture and color to make such a statment in this piece...it's truly a piece of art! Packaging and presentation in the gift box makes it even more special, IF we wanted to give it away. While its designed for a man, it would still make a beautiful fashion statement when worn by a woman! I really don't see this watch as being age or sex specific. It really would make an amazing gift for anyone and has proven to be a great conversation starter. Oh, also, I have checked, normally watches like these can easily exceed $200 with other companies so give as a gift and they will think you have spent much more on their gift. I have attached pictures of how it came in the beautiful box and what it looks like on my wrist with no links taken off, since it is now my husband's watch. I received this watch for free for my unbiased honest opinion according to my own and my husband's experience with this beautifully unique time piece.", "summary": "Gorgeous time piece for a man or woman!", "unixReviewTime": 1470096000}

The band is plenty long enough and some links can be taken off if it's too big. It has a stainless steel clasp and is made of sapphire crystal so it's scratch resistant. It's not waterproof so keep it out of pools and the shower but if it gets very lightly splashed it should be ok. It uses roman numerals instead of numbers which is different.

They look almost identical, block approximately the same amount of light, and are similarly polarized as the originals.  The fit isn't 100%, but it is very close.  A common complaint with other replacement brands were they are noticeably thinner and more flimsy than the original lenses, but from my naked eye observation, these are the same thickness.  Once in, I was blown away by their clarity.  In fairness, that is also a function of how scratched up my old lenses were, but still something to note.\n\nI will absolutely be buying another set or two.

The colors are very pale and almost look bleached out compared to the photo shown. It will work for my needs, I just hope that it holds up since the material is thin. It is cute, I like the cut and the back opening that shows the black straps and tribal print, it is comfortable to wear. I normally wear a medium and I ordered a large based on other reviews stating the top is too small and I'm so glad I did. The top barely works for me and I am a size 34dd, if it didn't come with the tank I probably wouldn't wear it at all for that reason. The tank is a little big, but I expected that, and the shorts fit perfectly, I wear a size 6 in pants and am curvy. I will be hand washing it as I don't trust the padding to come out of a wash cycle right. Overall, I like this bathing suit, and will be using it, but it is a little poorer quality than I would expect.

I don't know if that's clear, but the tank top is separate.  That's nice for me because I can cover my tummy now, but I have the option of a tanking when I get my figure back. The material seems a bit thinner than most suits, but I didn't see it in the sunlight, so I'm not sure about the coverage.\nThe important thing is the fit. Buying clothes online is tough, so I'll be as specific as possible. I am a tiny woman -about a 26 inch waist (0-1 in pants) and a C cup. I got a medium, which says 2-4 US. I'd guess that's the bottoms, and closer to a 2. The bottoms are a bit loose, but just enough to not squeeze anything (probably a similar fit to boxers on a guy.) The top made a stretching/ripping sound when getting it on and off, but once it was on, it covered my boobs well enough.  It's not secure like a sports bra, but I don't feel like I'd fall out if I cannonball. LOL. A small top wouldn't come close to fitting and a small bottom would probably be tight. Their tank top is nice and flows, but the shoulders are tight enough not to fall.\n\nI received this at a discount in exchange for my review.

It is not see-thru though pairs well with a cami. There is a small sleeve and a very modest neckline.  I am always looking for tops that are long enough for me and that will not cling to my body. I also need lightweight clothing as I do not do well in the heat.  I am 5'9\" tall and since I wasn't sure of the sizing difference I ordered a 3XL and the length and fit is right. Even if the shirt shrinks up any in the dryer it will still fit well. This shirt is very comfortable and looks great with a pair of jeans or you can accessorize and you're ready for a night out.

The dark brown elastic cord is very sturdy and has well tied knots.  I don't think Ill be losing any beads from a broken cord. Nice length for a necklace or a bracelet.  I don't usually wear a necklace but I put it over my head to check it out.  The beads are smooth and adjust to the body temperature and sort of 'hug' my neck gently.  Although I bought this to use as a bracelet/worry beads, I think I'll be wearing it as a necklace more. It will go with most any color.\nBe careful when you open the bag this comes in as the charm is not attached, but is in the bag separately.  At first I thought it didn't come with a charm, but went back to look and there it was.  I was so interested in seeing the pretty beads that I set the bag aside immediately and paid no attention to the charm.

The length is perfect it comes a few inches below the waist line and I wear petites. I am comfortable with that length and doesn't ride up when sitting. The size is way too small, I think the sizes are Asian/ petites. But even for that it seems small. I wear a small/ Medium and still the Large fits really really snug. It does say fitted so perfect description. The stitching and edging are really awesome.\nI would love to see a few more colors in them since they are really good. I don't know how they will be in winter, it says they stay warm in winter and cool in summer. They are really cool right now. I thing they will live up to the expectations since they are bamboo and cotton both of which do good in both climates. Overall I'm very pleased with this Shirt.

Please note that this is during July and August in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S.\n\nThe photos I included show photos of the leather up close for you to decide on the quality based on what you know. I examined the treated underside and how it naps over time, the belt loop, the belt holes, and the texture of the outer lining. See the cons section as to why the photos were taken this way.\n\nAs a young guy, this belt starts my foray into leather belts after wearing synthetic leather department store belts my whole life. To day the least, this is hands down the most comfortable belt I have worn in my whole life so far. I've worn it with jeans and business casual attire and it looks great. Not to mention that the color of this belt matches most cognac, walnut, or tan leather shoes and watch straps. I almost thought about returning it for reasons mentioned further down the review, but ultimately, I couldn't do it. The following reasons offer a brief summary of what makes the belt good.\n\nPros:\n- The belt is really supple and It broke in very well after the 2nd day of use. Since then it's been very easy to bend and loop around my pants.\n- It feels very nice to the touch, it's not oiled like a dressy watch strap, so it has a slight suede to it even though it's not suede.\n- The buckle is round and comfortable, and it doesn't poke and stab my gut like all my previous belts have (both round and square buckles)\n- The color started as a cognac color and has darkened a shade or two since wearing the belt (indicator of real leather).\n\nCons:\nMy biggest criticism of the watch is about how there's no definitive way to tell what grade of leather this is. The description says full grain leather, but I figured that a company would be proud of that and rightly plant it on the belt itself like most other companies do. I have the $7 full grain leather belt from costco that even has the \"full grain leather\" stamp on it. A summary of other minor cons are below.\n\n- There is a loose stitch at the end of one of the buckle leather pieces\n- The buckle has no indent to hold the pin, thus it moves the belt slightly. It's hard to notice though\n- The buckle comes with some sanding and indenting already to give it a \"vintage\" feeling. I can see where people might find this off-putting\n- The underside has some sort of treatment to prevent napping, I would've preferred the natural nap as shown in the belt loop.", "summary": "Good for replacing department store belts", "unixReviewTime": 1506211200}

It's maybe slightly longer than I need, but it's a good fit.

I was very excited to try this necklace.  On screen it looked very enticing and fun and would go with many of my outfits.  I was excited to finally receive this today and put it with my favorite blue shirtto find that the necklace more turquoise than blue.  The shirt that I thought it was going to go perfect with is a dark Phatalo Blue and my husband agrees that the leather straps are more turquoise than blue.\nThe stones are very cute, but Im not sold that they are genuine stone.  Three have 90 degree bends leading me to believe that some of this is shell that has been dyed.  Other pieces I could not find evidence of striations that are typical to all types of stone (rocks, fossils, crystals etc.) that I am familiar with.  The gold colored chain that they are placed onto is very light and has barely any weight to it.  I unfastened it from my neck a couple of times to try out the sizing and the extender did somehow become detached from the necklace via a very tiny gap in the ring.  This necklace was produced in China.\nThis is still an interesting piece to have in my collection, though I feel that this necklace is rather cheaply constructed.\nI received Multi-Strand Fashion Necklace Featuring Gold Chain and Polished Charms for free in exchange for a fair and honest review.

The cups are a pain in the rear - the padding inside folds up constantly and it makes the top very \"boxy\" looking. I have to constantly fix/re-adjust them.  All in all, the suit is pretty TTS and very comfortable.  I'm not generally a fan of the tie-back tops, they tend to pull on my neck. However, it is pretty comfortable and the straps are relatively substantial so they don't dig into your neck the way some do when you are larger on top.\n\nI don't have high hopes, however, that this suit will hold up much past one season.  Even when pulling it on you can hear the seams kind of \"pop\" and stretch - not indicative of a well-made suit.  But for the price, I guess I'm getting what I paid for.\n\nI DO love the bottom (under the skirt). It has great coverage unlike many suit bottoms, IMO.  They are little 'boy short' style bottoms and they don't ride up, fold, etc.  They are very comfortable and that's pretty much why I gave this suit 4 stars vs. 3 stars.  The bottoms portion of the suit is great!\n\nI am on the short side (5'4\") and the skirt comes down pretty long (just above my knee, really). Much longer than expected.  But it's good coverage so I can't complain!\n\nI ALWAYS wear a cover-up with a swimsuit (I'm so self-conscious) but I received some compliments on the top b/c I\"m not afraid to show the top of my suit/chest area (whereas a lot of suits don't give me full coverage/make me feel comfortable).", "summary": "Flattering suit", "unixReviewTime": 1470096000}

It is bigger than Jansport Half Pint and slightly smaller than Roxy Always Core.  Jansport has cover over the zipper but there's no lining and no padding.  The straps are webbing that can dig into shoulders when the load is too heavy.  It also has a key stay that both Mini Kane and Always Core don't have.  Mini Kane and Always Core are lined and have padded regular width shoulder strap.\n\nMini Kane is made of fabric used for most school backpacks; tough and long lasting.  The padding is on the backside, bottom, and part of the sides.  It is meant to protect the tablet.  However, the main compartment has no tablet sleeve or a zip pouch.  The outside pocket is slightly gusseted but not meant for any bulky item (won't zip up).  The side pockets have velcro tabs but the sewing is sub-part (mine is already unraveling).  If you have a big Android phone, the pocket may be too small for it.  Sunglasses without case is fine though.  The satiny webbing is also sewn on the strap that you can affix a biner or two.  Because the webbing is satiny, it is hard to have it stay at the length you desire.  To fix it, just use a 1\" safety pin to not having to adjust shoulder straps.\n\nIf you are looking for a fashion backpack that doesn't look like a school pack and is comfortable to carry, this is a good choice.  The dino camo is brilliant!  It is the reason I bought it (because I already have Roxy Always Core and Jansport Half Pint).  I just got a pterodactyl pin before I found this backpack.  It was fate.

I ordered a size small for him based on the sizing chart and other reviewers recommendations. When they arrived he was initially unhappy with the color, as they appear far more yellow than khaki. However, he tried them on and said they were comfortable so he would be fine wearing them.\n\nThe shorts are very long, and they reached halfway past his knees, but for some reason the crotch area was very tight, almost as if they were made for a woman's physique... Everything was on full display, and the seam in the middle of the shorts was dividing 'things' VERY obviously. (Google 'moose knuckle' if you're unsure what I'm trying to allude to.) It was a bit ridiculous how much was on display!\n\nI would have chalked it up to the sizing being off, and ordered him a larger size in another color, but I had ordered my dad a pair of the same shorts in an extra large and he had the exact same problem. The shorts fit correctly everywhere except for the crotch area. The length, waist, and butt area fit fine, but you'd have to be a woman to wear these and not turn a few heads! Yikes!\n\nUnfortunately I ended up returning both pairs, which was disappointing because they were a great price.\nAs an addicted Amazon buyer, I rely on real people's opinions to make educated decisions about what items are worth it to spend my hard-earned money on.

I bought this and another ROMWE dress before hubby and I took an anniversary getaway to a tropical resort- I've had 3 kids, so I liked that it was very forgiving to my not so flat mom-tummy! I'm 5' and 125lbs, the small was maybe a tad big, but like I said, I liked how forgiving it was. I also appreciated that it travels well, once I hung it up at the hotel, all the wrinkles fell right out and I didn't have to fuss over it any more. I wore this particular one as my swim suit cover up most of the trip, but I also wore it to dinner a couple of the nights. I bought it in rose and I plan on hand washing if needed, I don't think it will hold up in the wash...but like I said, for less than $20 it was completely worth it for \"resort wear\"!! I wished I'd bought this one in 2 more colors for our trip when it was all said & done!", "summary": "It's great for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1477440000}

It would have been nice if there was an actual small or extra small size.  The material thickness is consistent throughout the garment without a distinct waist band, so these leggings are probably not the best to wear for high impact or movement intensive activities.  They are definitely perfect for yoga, though!\n\nI purchased these leggings at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.

Overall I am happy with them but there are a few little things that could be better.\n\nThe mesh is very breathable and although I do not think they are actually water shoes, they can easily be worn to a splash pad or something, as they dry pretty quickly. My baby wore them to a water park and they worked great. I did take off a star for texture...it is SUPER rough and scratchy. The girls did not seem to be bothered by it too much but they are not the most comfortable thing to put on them.\n\nThe color is as advertised...we got the purple ones and the girls were thrilled. Very pretty shades of purple...they compliment each other well.\n\nThe arch support is pretty flimsy, also why only 4 stars.\n\nThe neoprene rim around the top is great...keeps the shoes on very well. I sized up too much for my littlest and despite being too big, they stayed on her feet all 5 hours we were at a water park in and out of the pool, slides, etc. and only slipped off a couple of times. My other daughter whose fit perfectly had no issues.\n\nLOVE the double loop. Makes them SUPER easy to get off and on...use the loop on top to help slide the foot in and then pull up the back with the back loop. Excellent feature. I especially appreciated after I tried to get a different pair of water shoes on the almost 2-year old.\n\nThey fit slightly on the smaller side but not awful. You might need to size up.\n\nCute style. They look really cute...not so narrow as other mesh shoes I have seen.\n\nNice, thick sole. Keeps their feet very well protected from rocks, rough pool bottoms, hot asphalt, etc. Also has good tread. We had no problems with slipping on the wet pool area.\n\nOverall, they do exactly what I need them to do so I am pleased with the purchase. I have some that are nearly identical and they keep my feet pretty cool, are easy to slip on, and fairly comfortable to wear. My feet have no arches so I need more support than shoes like these offer but kids run around in flip flops without problems where I feel like my feet are going to fall off from hurting so much so the girls have had no issues with wearing them for several hours at a time. If you are looking for orthopedic support, these are not it. But they work great for easy summer shoes. Disclaimer: I was fortunate enough to receive these at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review. I rely very heavily on the reviews of others because I do nearly all my shopping online so I strive to leave helpful feedback on both items I buy at full price and those which I have received for free or at a discount.

As soon as he saw this, it was instantly his favorite. He works in a home improvement store, so having a wooden watch is a really cool thing to have, and the design and size of this one is simply stunning. He says he gets more questions and compliments on this watch than he ever has on anything else.\n\nWhat we like:\n*  My husband says his favorite part about this watch is the size. He likes bigger watches and this one is the perfect size according to him. Big bold face that looks great on his fairly large wrist.\n*  The overall coloring. The Zebrawood looks absolutely stunning, and it is a real eye catcher. It still looks like wood, but the zebra look to it just takes it to another level.\n*  The time is easily read, and the Roman Numerals look great. It adds another layer of class to it, and the dials look great as well. Substantial and easily seen, even in the dark since the dials glow in the dark.\n*  Easy to set with the crown on the side, and it isn't so big that it hurts the wrist when you bend your hand all the way back.\n*  The band with the flexible wood links looks great. So professional and adds even more class to it. Also comes with lots of links, so its easily adjustable for almost anyone to wear.\n*  The foldover clasp makes it very easy to put on and take off with one hand.\n*  My husband has been wearing this every single day for over a week now, and it still doesn't have any scratches on the face.\n*  Comes in a lovely box sitting on a black leather pillow, so it would make an excellent gift!\n\nWhat we don't like:\n1) This watch DOES NOT tolerate water other than in very small amounts, like washing your hands and then drying underneath it. The wood will swell up and the links won't move anymore, and it may even affect the watch itself if it absorbs too much.\n\nOverall, My husband thinks this is a fantastic watch and he is thrilled with it. It was given to him as a gift from me and he didn't like that I kept it for a day so I could take the pictures and video for this. Its always his first choice watch and we couldn't be happier with it!\n\n**I purchased this watch at a promotional discount for the purposes of testing and reviewing, but my cost has absolutely no bearing on how I rate a product. I will NEVER give a positive review to an item that doesn't fully deserve it.**", "summary": "Has become my husbands favorite watch! He loves it!", "unixReviewTime": 1470787200}

In a short period of time, you can simply remove the links yourself to have the watch fit as needed. It can fit my very small femine wrist (a little lose when sized completely down) and it fits a little loose (what hes customed to) on my husband's very large wrist with no links removed. It has a metal band clasp, where the compressing strenth is about mid-range so not hard to undo but you don't have to worry about the black time set button or the clasp getting caught on something or bumped and coming undone. The numbers are set up in black roman numberals and don't stand out a whole lot to be flashy but all numbers on the face, can be easily read with average sight at proper arms length. The bright glow in the dark hour and minute hands are very easy to be seen in the day or at night. It is a big watch but not chunky or thick to get in the way of movement or clothes. Light weight and yet, not a delicate watch because of the wood they chose to make it from. This is not a dressy watch but it definately works for work, whether its a uniform, jeans or dockers. It may work with a suit depending on the suit. It will work for a night out clubbing, day on the golf course, enjoying a sporting event or dinner and movie with your special someone. It is not easy to find a watch that works well but is also unique looking...this one is both! Not only is it unique to well known brand watches, it's one of a kind since every grain of wood is one of a kind! I can't believe how they use texture and color to make such a statment in this piece...it's truly a piece of art! Packaging and presentation in the gift box makes it even more special, IF we wanted to give it away. While its designed for a man, it would still make a beautiful fashion statement when worn by a woman! I really don't see this watch as being age or sex specific. It really would make an amazing gift for anyone and has proven to be a great conversation starter. Oh, also, I have checked, normally watches like these can easily exceed $200 with other companies so give as a gift and they will think you have spent much more on their gift. I have attached pictures of how it came in the beautiful box and what it looks like on my wrist with no links taken off, since it is now my husband's watch. I received this watch for free for my unbiased honest opinion according to my own and my husband's experience with this beautifully unique time piece.", "summary": "Gorgeous time piece for a man or woman!", "unixReviewTime": 1470096000}

The band is plenty long enough and some links can be taken off if it's too big. It has a stainless steel clasp and is made of sapphire crystal so it's scratch resistant. It's not waterproof so keep it out of pools and the shower but if it gets very lightly splashed it should be ok. It uses roman numerals instead of numbers which is different.

I have big boobs, so I did have to take this padding out, but the material is thick enough with the dual layers that I don't need it anyway. A stylish sports bra and shorts for a swimsuit anyday!!

They look almost identical, block approximately the same amount of light, and are similarly polarized as the originals.  The fit isn't 100%, but it is very close.  A common complaint with other replacement brands were they are noticeably thinner and more flimsy than the original lenses, but from my naked eye observation, these are the same thickness.  Once in, I was blown away by their clarity.  In fairness, that is also a function of how scratched up my old lenses were, but still something to note.\n\nI will absolutely be buying another set or two.

I opened a Word document, and the key strokes were very responsive with no errors. Personally, I thought that the touch pad was as fast and responsive as the ones on my laptops.\n\nWhen i tested it on my android TV box, and it was so very much better than the remote that came with the TV box. The touch pad worked well as a mouse, and data entry was so much easier. I also very much like that pressing FN and 6 lights the keyboard. So it can be used in the dark. This keyboard would also be very beneficial for use with a laptop when using a mouse is not convenient. In my opinion, this keyboard would be useful. for any device that the USB dongle can be plugged in.\n\nThis keyboard comes with a USB charging cable and the 2.4 GHz USB dongle can be plugged in. It also comes with a user guide that plainly describes the uses of the FN functions and how to use the keyboard.

The bust band was too big (and not adjustable at all, just a band), and the padding in the chest area was lumpy and not in a proper position. There was no way to remove the padding either, so you would have to cut the seam in that area to remove the padding, and I'm not sure if it could be re-sewn easily without knowing how to sew well.

The top barely works for me and I am a size 34dd, if it didn't come with the tank I probably wouldn't wear it at all for that reason. The tank is a little big, but I expected that, and the shorts fit perfectly, I wear a size 6 in pants and am curvy.

The material seems a bit thinner than most suits, but I didn't see it in the sunlight, so I'm not sure about the coverage.\nThe important thing is the fit. Buying clothes online is tough, so I'll be as specific as possible. I am a tiny woman -about a 26 inch waist (0-1 in pants) and a C cup. I got a medium, which says 2-4 US. I'd guess that's the bottoms, and closer to a 2. The bottoms are a bit loose, but just enough to not squeeze anything (probably a similar fit to boxers on a guy.) The top made a stretching/ripping sound when getting it on and off, but once it was on, it covered my boobs well enough.  It's not secure like a sports bra, but I don't feel like I'd fall out if I cannonball. LOL. A small top wouldn't come close to fitting and a small bottom would probably be tight. Their tank top is nice and flows, but the shoulders are tight enough not to fall.\n\nI received this at a discount in exchange for my review.

The elastic at the waist was not flat and would bend in half on the inside of the shorts.  The bra top was super cute with all the straps, BUT was waaaay too small.  If you are a size A bra fit, then it would probably work for you.  This top didn't cover my breasts completely.  It was also padded which I didn't like as it made it feel cheap.  The black top that goes over the bra top was really big and baggy and did not fit at all like the picture.  Overall I was disappointed with the quality of this item (cheap fabric and not made well) and the fact that the fitting was all over the place.

The Wine color is so rich. My purchase of this Elbon Boutique Womens Short Sleeve V-Neck Tunic Top With Handkerchief Hem was made on a whim.  It looked so cute on the model in the picture.  I did not expect it to look good on me or to even be as good as it appeared.  I was so wrong.  The quality is great. The material is lightweight but not really thin. It is not see-thru though pairs well with a cami. There is a small sleeve and a very modest neckline.  I am always looking for tops that are long enough for me and that will not cling to my body. I also need lightweight clothing as I do not do well in the heat.  I am 5'9\" tall and since I wasn't sure of the sizing difference I ordered a 3XL and the length and fit is right. Even if the shirt shrinks up any in the dryer it will still fit well. This shirt is very comfortable and looks great with a pair of jeans or you can accessorize and you're ready for a night out.  With 20 colors to choose from there is a color to go with almost anything.\nI have received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my true and unbiased review.\nI am not connected to this seller and receive no compensation for my reviews.

I was however a little surprised on the color, it said grey but I was expecting a brownish grey like in the picture. But it's a pure grey grey!!! The length is perfect it comes a few inches below the waist line and I wear petites. I am comfortable with that length and doesn't ride up when sitting. The size is way too small, I think the sizes are Asian/ petites. But even for that it seems small. I wear a small/ Medium and still the Large fits really really snug. It does say fitted so perfect description. The stitching and edging are really awesome.\nI would love to see a few more colors in them since they are really good. I don't know how they will be in winter, it says they stay warm in winter and cool in summer. They are really cool right now. I thing they will live up to the expectations since they are bamboo and cotton both of which do good in both climates. Overall I'm very pleased with this Shirt. Would buy more if they are available in more colors since I already have way too many black t-shirts.\nI loved the fact that it has full shoulder coverage which makes it even more versatile and perfect for exercising.

Please note that this is during July and August in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S.\n\nThe photos I included show photos of the leather up close for you to decide on the quality based on what you know. I examined the treated underside and how it naps over time, the belt loop, the belt holes, and the texture of the outer lining. See the cons section as to why the photos were taken this way.\n\nAs a young guy, this belt starts my foray into leather belts after wearing synthetic leather department store belts my whole life. To day the least, this is hands down the most comfortable belt I have worn in my whole life so far. I've worn it with jeans and business casual attire and it looks great. Not to mention that the color of this belt matches most cognac, walnut, or tan leather shoes and watch straps. I almost thought about returning it for reasons mentioned further down the review, but ultimately, I couldn't do it. The following reasons offer a brief summary of what makes the belt good.\n\nPros:\n- The belt is really supple and It broke in very well after the 2nd day of use. Since then it's been very easy to bend and loop around my pants.\n- It feels very nice to the touch, it's not oiled like a dressy watch strap, so it has a slight suede to it even though it's not suede.\n- The buckle is round and comfortable, and it doesn't poke and stab my gut like all my previous belts have (both round and square buckles)\n- The color started as a cognac color and has darkened a shade or two since wearing the belt (indicator of real leather).\n\nCons:\nMy biggest criticism of the watch is about how there's no definitive way to tell what grade of leather this is. The description says full grain leather, but I figured that a company would be proud of that and rightly plant it on the belt itself like most other companies do. I have the $7 full grain leather belt from costco that even has the \"full grain leather\" stamp on it. A summary of other minor cons are below.\n\n- There is a loose stitch at the end of one of the buckle leather pieces\n- The buckle has no indent to hold the pin, thus it moves the belt slightly. It's hard to notice though\n- The buckle comes with some sanding and indenting already to give it a \"vintage\" feeling. I can see where people might find this off-putting\n- The underside has some sort of treatment to prevent napping, I would've preferred the natural nap as shown in the belt loop.", "summary": "Good for replacing department store belts", "unixReviewTime": 1506211200}

It's maybe slightly longer than I need, but it's a good fit.

Also, the neckline was very wide on me, and I didn't care for that either; not on this particular shirt. I didn't notice the neckline seam being itchy, though, so that was nice. (The pictures are low-quality, but I do hope they may help in someway. <3)\n  The sleeves taper, and from my elbow to my wrist they were very slim (or very snug, I might say). However, they did stretch a bit to a more comfortable fit after wearing it a little longer.\n  If the front and back of this shirt were loose-fitting I would be totally okay with the cons, here.

It is bigger than Jansport Half Pint and slightly smaller than Roxy Always Core.  Jansport has cover over the zipper but there's no lining and no padding.  The straps are webbing that can dig into shoulders when the load is too heavy.  It also has a key stay that both Mini Kane and Always Core don't have.  Mini Kane and Always Core are lined and have padded regular width shoulder strap.\n\nMini Kane is made of fabric used for most school backpacks; tough and long lasting.  The padding is on the backside, bottom, and part of the sides.  It is meant to protect the tablet.  However, the main compartment has no tablet sleeve or a zip pouch.  The outside pocket is slightly gusseted but not meant for any bulky item (won't zip up).  The side pockets have velcro tabs but the sewing is sub-part (mine is already unraveling).  If you have a big Android phone, the pocket may be too small for it.  Sunglasses without case is fine though.  The satiny webbing is also sewn on the strap that you can affix a biner or two.  Because the webbing is satiny, it is hard to have it stay at the length you desire.  To fix it, just use a 1\" safety pin to not having to adjust shoulder straps.\n\nIf you are looking for a fashion backpack that doesn't look like a school pack and is comfortable to carry, this is a good choice.  The dino camo is brilliant!  It is the reason I bought it (because I already have Roxy Always Core and Jansport Half Pint).  I just got a pterodactyl pin before I found this backpack.  It was fate.

Id honestly give my first suit 5/5 stars but this one will take some additional work to be ready for interviews/events. Really if the pants were bigger (the mediums in my light grey suit still fit great) I would probably go 4/5 stars here but theres absolutely no consistency in sizing here.

I ordered a size small for him based on the sizing chart and other reviewers recommendations. When they arrived he was initially unhappy with the color, as they appear far more yellow than khaki. However, he tried them on and said they were comfortable so he would be fine wearing them.\n\nThe shorts are very long, and they reached halfway past his knees, but for some reason the crotch area was very tight, almost as if they were made for a woman's physique... Everything was on full display, and the seam in the middle of the shorts was dividing 'things' VERY obviously. (Google 'moose knuckle' if you're unsure what I'm trying to allude to.) It was a bit ridiculous how much was on display!\n\nI would have chalked it up to the sizing being off, and ordered him a larger size in another color, but I had ordered my dad a pair of the same shorts in an extra large and he had the exact same problem. The shorts fit correctly everywhere except for the crotch area. The length, waist, and butt area fit fine, but you'd have to be a woman to wear these and not turn a few heads! Yikes!\n\nUnfortunately I ended up returning both pairs, which was disappointing because they were a great price.\nAs an addicted Amazon buyer, I rely on real people's opinions to make educated decisions about what items are worth it to spend my hard-earned money on.

It would have been nice if there was an actual small or extra small size.  The material thickness is consistent throughout the garment without a distinct waist band, so these leggings are probably not the best to wear for high impact or movement intensive activities.  They are definitely perfect for yoga, though!\n\nI purchased these leggings at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.

Overall I am happy with them but there are a few little things that could be better.\n\nThe mesh is very breathable and although I do not think they are actually water shoes, they can easily be worn to a splash pad or something, as they dry pretty quickly. My baby wore them to a water park and they worked great. I did take off a star for texture...it is SUPER rough and scratchy. The girls did not seem to be bothered by it too much but they are not the most comfortable thing to put on them.\n\nThe color is as advertised...we got the purple ones and the girls were thrilled. Very pretty shades of purple...they compliment each other well.\n\nThe arch support is pretty flimsy, also why only 4 stars.\n\nThe neoprene rim around the top is great...keeps the shoes on very well. I sized up too much for my littlest and despite being too big, they stayed on her feet all 5 hours we were at a water park in and out of the pool, slides, etc. and only slipped off a couple of times. My other daughter whose fit perfectly had no issues.\n\nLOVE the double loop. Makes them SUPER easy to get off and on...use the loop on top to help slide the foot in and then pull up the back with the back loop. Excellent feature. I especially appreciated after I tried to get a different pair of water shoes on the almost 2-year old.\n\nThey fit slightly on the smaller side but not awful. You might need to size up.\n\nCute style. They look really cute...not so narrow as other mesh shoes I have seen.\n\nNice, thick sole. Keeps their feet very well protected from rocks, rough pool bottoms, hot asphalt, etc. Also has good tread. We had no problems with slipping on the wet pool area.\n\nOverall, they do exactly what I need them to do so I am pleased with the purchase. I have some that are nearly identical and they keep my feet pretty cool, are easy to slip on, and fairly comfortable to wear. My feet have no arches so I need more support than shoes like these offer but kids run around in flip flops without problems where I feel like my feet are going to fall off from hurting so much so the girls have had no issues with wearing them for several hours at a time. If you are looking for orthopedic support, these are not it. But they work great for easy summer shoes. Disclaimer: I was fortunate enough to receive these at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review. I rely very heavily on the reviews of others because I do nearly all my shopping online so I strive to leave helpful feedback on both items I buy at full price and those which I have received for free or at a discount. I hope this has helped you in your purchasing decision.

The material is very light-weight and breathable, and has proven to be very comfortable and cool while worn outside in the summer heat.\n\nThe shirt wears well, but is a little tighter than most large-sized shirts that I own.

I had imagined, based on the seller's description picture, that it would hang loosely.\n\nI would have returned this shirt for a refund, based on the BRIGHT color that I'll have little use for; but I did receive this shirt at a discount from Leeberry, in exchange for my honest review, and for that price, I'll just save everyone the hassle.\n\nLike you, I base my purchase decisions on the experiences of others.

As soon as he saw this, it was instantly his favorite. He works in a home improvement store, so having a wooden watch is a really cool thing to have, and the design and size of this one is simply stunning. He says he gets more questions and compliments on this watch than he ever has on anything else.\n\nWhat we like:\n*  My husband says his favorite part about this watch is the size. He likes bigger watches and this one is the perfect size according to him. Big bold face that looks great on his fairly large wrist.\n*  The overall coloring. The Zebrawood looks absolutely stunning, and it is a real eye catcher. It still looks like wood, but the zebra look to it just takes it to another level.\n*  The time is easily read, and the Roman Numerals look great. It adds another layer of class to it, and the dials look great as well. Substantial and easily seen, even in the dark since the dials glow in the dark.\n*  Easy to set with the crown on the side, and it isn't so big that it hurts the wrist when you bend your hand all the way back.\n*  The band with the flexible wood links looks great. So professional and adds even more class to it. Also comes with lots of links, so its easily adjustable for almost anyone to wear.\n*  The foldover clasp makes it very easy to put on and take off with one hand.\n*  My husband has been wearing this every single day for over a week now, and it still doesn't have any scratches on the face.\n*  Comes in a lovely box sitting on a black leather pillow, so it would make an excellent gift!\n\nWhat we don't like:\n1) This watch DOES NOT tolerate water other than in very small amounts, like washing your hands and then drying underneath it. The wood will swell up and the links won't move anymore, and it may even affect the watch itself if it absorbs too much.\n\nOverall, My husband thinks this is a fantastic watch and he is thrilled with it. It was given to him as a gift from me and he didn't like that I kept it for a day so I could take the pictures and video for this. Its always his first choice watch and we couldn't be happier with it!\n\n**I purchased this watch at a promotional discount for the purposes of testing and reviewing, but my cost has absolutely no bearing on how I rate a product. I will NEVER give a positive review to an item that doesn't fully deserve it.**", "summary": "Has become my husbands favorite watch! He loves it!", "unixReviewTime": 1470787200}

In a short period of time, you can simply remove the links yourself to have the watch fit as needed. It can fit my very small femine wrist (a little lose when sized completely down) and it fits a little loose (what hes customed to) on my husband's very large wrist with no links removed. It has a metal band clasp, where the compressing strenth is about mid-range so not hard to undo but you don't have to worry about the black time set button or the clasp getting caught on something or bumped and coming undone. The numbers are set up in black roman numberals and don't stand out a whole lot to be flashy but all numbers on the face, can be easily read with average sight at proper arms length. The bright glow in the dark hour and minute hands are very easy to be seen in the day or at night. It is a big watch but not chunky or thick to get in the way of movement or clothes. Light weight and yet, not a delicate watch because of the wood they chose to make it from. This is not a dressy watch but it definately works for work, whether its a uniform, jeans or dockers. It may work with a suit depending on the suit. It will work for a night out clubbing, day on the golf course, enjoying a sporting event or dinner and movie with your special someone. It is not easy to find a watch that works well but is also unique looking...this one is both! Not only is it unique to well known brand watches, it's one of a kind since every grain of wood is one of a kind! I can't believe how they use texture and color to make such a statment in this piece...it's truly a piece of art! Packaging and presentation in the gift box makes it even more special, IF we wanted to give it away. While its designed for a man, it would still make a beautiful fashion statement when worn by a woman! I really don't see this watch as being age or sex specific. It really would make an amazing gift for anyone and has proven to be a great conversation starter. Oh, also, I have checked, normally watches like these can easily exceed $200 with other companies so give as a gift and they will think you have spent much more on their gift. I have attached pictures of how it came in the beautiful box and what it looks like on my wrist with no links taken off, since it is now my husband's watch. I received this watch for free for my unbiased honest opinion according to my own and my husband's experience with this beautifully unique time piece.", "summary": "Gorgeous time piece for a man or woman!", "unixReviewTime": 1470096000}

The band is plenty long enough and some links can be taken off if it's too big. It has a stainless steel clasp and is made of sapphire crystal so it's scratch resistant. It's not waterproof so keep it out of pools and the shower but if it gets very lightly splashed it should be ok. It uses roman numerals instead of numbers which is different. The hands even glow so you see the time at night without having to turn on a light. Overall I like this watch and would recommend it to others.

They look almost identical, block approximately the same amount of light, and are similarly polarized as the originals.  The fit isn't 100%, but it is very close.  A common complaint with other replacement brands were they are noticeably thinner and more flimsy than the original lenses, but from my naked eye observation, these are the same thickness.  Once in, I was blown away by their clarity.  In fairness, that is also a function of how scratched up my old lenses were, but still something to note.\n\nI will absolutely be buying another set or two.  That's not something I would have ever considered, but the affordable price point allows it with these.

In my opinion, this keyboard would be useful. for any device that the USB dongle can be plugged in.\n\nThis keyboard comes with a USB charging cable and the 2.4 GHz USB dongle can be plugged in. It also comes with a user guide that plainly describes the uses of the FN functions and how to use the keyboard.

I loved the way it fit on the bottom, but the top was weird. Weird in a way that I could not consider it wearable. The bust band was too big (and not adjustable at all, just a band), and the padding in the chest area was lumpy and not in a proper position. There was no way to remove the padding either, so you would have to cut the seam in that area to remove the padding, and I'm not sure if it could be re-sewn easily without knowing how to sew well.

The material seems a bit thinner than most suits, but I didn't see it in the sunlight, so I'm not sure about the coverage.\nThe important thing is the fit. Buying clothes online is tough, so I'll be as specific as possible. I am a tiny woman -about a 26 inch waist (0-1 in pants) and a C cup. I got a medium, which says 2-4 US. I'd guess that's the bottoms, and closer to a 2. The bottoms are a bit loose, but just enough to not squeeze anything (probably a similar fit to boxers on a guy.) The top made a stretching/ripping sound when getting it on and off, but once it was on, it covered my boobs well enough.  It's not secure like a sports bra, but I don't feel like I'd fall out if I cannonball. LOL. A small top wouldn't come close to fitting and a small bottom would probably be tight. Their tank top is nice and flows, but the shoulders are tight enough not to fall.\n\nI received this at a discount in exchange for my review.

The Wine color is so rich. My purchase of this Elbon Boutique Womens Short Sleeve V-Neck Tunic Top With Handkerchief Hem was made on a whim.  It looked so cute on the model in the picture.  I did not expect it to look good on me or to even be as good as it appeared.  I was so wrong.  The quality is great. The material is lightweight but not really thin. It is not see-thru though pairs well with a cami. There is a small sleeve and a very modest neckline.  I am always looking for tops that are long enough for me and that will not cling to my body. I also need lightweight clothing as I do not do well in the heat.  I am 5'9\" tall and since I wasn't sure of the sizing difference I ordered a 3XL and the length and fit is right. Even if the shirt shrinks up any in the dryer it will still fit well. This shirt is very comfortable and looks great with a pair of jeans or you can accessorize and you're ready for a night out.  With 20 colors to choose from there is a color to go with almost anything.\nI have received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my true and unbiased review.\nI am not connected to this seller and receive no compensation for my reviews.

I've used many sports tops, this one felt really comfortable to go for a walk or jog and I can later wear it for the groceries too. Very comfortable. I loved the color. It really looks the same as in the picture figure hugging. The material is very soft it's a mix of bamboo and cotton but feels like cottony to skin. It stayed a little cool in it which was very nice since it's really warm right now. I liked the V neckline, it looks very smart and it's not too deep.\nThe most impressive part was the arm holes they are so perfect as if custom stitched. I was however a little surprised on the color, it said grey but I was expecting a brownish grey like in the picture. But it's a pure grey grey!!! The length is perfect it comes a few inches below the waist line and I wear petites. I am comfortable with that length and doesn't ride up when sitting. The size is way too small, I think the sizes are Asian/ petites. But even for that it seems small. I wear a small/ Medium and still the Large fits really really snug. It does say fitted so perfect description. The stitching and edging are really awesome.\nI would love to see a few more colors in them since they are really good. I don't know how they will be in winter, it says they stay warm in winter and cool in summer. They are really cool right now. I thing they will live up to the expectations since they are bamboo and cotton both of which do good in both climates. Overall I'm very pleased with this Shirt. Would buy more if they are available in more colors since I already have way too many black t-shirts.\nI loved the fact that it has full shoulder coverage which makes it even more versatile and perfect for exercising. It covers more than 3\" on the shoulder.\nI received this product at a discounted rate to try and give my honest and unbiased review.

The other parts of the necklace look ok I think it is how the gold stands out too much. The clasps were fine on the necklace and so far it hasn't broken or anything. Not sure, don't think its too much for me.  I received this phalanx brand development fashion necklace for free or for a discounted price in exchange for my personal review and opinion.

Please note that this is during July and August in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S.\n\nThe photos I included show photos of the leather up close for you to decide on the quality based on what you know. I examined the treated underside and how it naps over time, the belt loop, the belt holes, and the texture of the outer lining. See the cons section as to why the photos were taken this way.\n\nAs a young guy, this belt starts my foray into leather belts after wearing synthetic leather department store belts my whole life. To day the least, this is hands down the most comfortable belt I have worn in my whole life so far. I've worn it with jeans and business casual attire and it looks great. Not to mention that the color of this belt matches most cognac, walnut, or tan leather shoes and watch straps. I almost thought about returning it for reasons mentioned further down the review, but ultimately, I couldn't do it. The following reasons offer a brief summary of what makes the belt good.\n\nPros:\n- The belt is really supple and It broke in very well after the 2nd day of use. Since then it's been very easy to bend and loop around my pants.\n- It feels very nice to the touch, it's not oiled like a dressy watch strap, so it has a slight suede to it even though it's not suede.\n- The buckle is round and comfortable, and it doesn't poke and stab my gut like all my previous belts have (both round and square buckles)\n- The color started as a cognac color and has darkened a shade or two since wearing the belt (indicator of real leather).\n\nCons:\nMy biggest criticism of the watch is about how there's no definitive way to tell what grade of leather this is. The description says full grain leather, but I figured that a company would be proud of that and rightly plant it on the belt itself like most other companies do. I have the $7 full grain leather belt from costco that even has the \"full grain leather\" stamp on it. A summary of other minor cons are below.\n\n- There is a loose stitch at the end of one of the buckle leather pieces\n- The buckle has no indent to hold the pin, thus it moves the belt slightly. It's hard to notice though\n- The buckle comes with some sanding and indenting already to give it a \"vintage\" feeling. I can see where people might find this off-putting\n- The underside has some sort of treatment to prevent napping, I would've preferred the natural nap as shown in the belt loop.", "summary": "Good for replacing department store belts", "unixReviewTime": 1506211200}

It's maybe slightly longer than I need, but it's a good fit.

It is a tad long- I needed an XL, but with the yoga pants type fold over waistband it is easy to make it longer or shorter.

I don't care for the way it fits in the lower-back. As I mentioned earlier, I do love the length, but being as it's more fitted it just doesn't look as well as it could. Also, the neckline was very wide on me, and I didn't care for that either; not on this particular shirt. I didn't notice the neckline seam being itchy, though, so that was nice. (The pictures are low-quality, but I do hope they may help in someway. <3)\n  The sleeves taper, and from my elbow to my wrist they were very slim (or very snug, I might say). However, they did stretch a bit to a more comfortable fit after wearing it a little longer.\n  If the front and back of this shirt were loose-fitting I would be totally okay with the cons, here.

Something I noticed is it proved to be versatile due to it being a combination of both a tote and a handbag. I'm amazed at the extravagant simple design that this holds as it doesn't become a flashy merchandise product. The thing that's really cool about this bag is that it comes nicely packaged and it's folded as a miniature bag; it also have a feature that allows you to expand it. The fabric seems to be nylon, something that's unique to me because it's also waterproof. The width of this bag, which is 17\" is a big plus to this bag. I can carry a lot of things in this backpack such as my 15.6 Toshiba laptop, and a few books and notebooks. I can get carried away about how this bag is a bag that has the intended purpose of a backpack but in a summary, you'll be happy that you can hold many things in this bag and get around with it really easily.\n\nI received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

They are little 'boy short' style bottoms and they don't ride up, fold, etc.  They are very comfortable and that's pretty much why I gave this suit 4 stars vs. 3 stars.

It is bigger than Jansport Half Pint and slightly smaller than Roxy Always Core.  Jansport has cover over the zipper but there's no lining and no padding.  The straps are webbing that can dig into shoulders when the load is too heavy.  It also has a key stay that both Mini Kane and Always Core don't have.  Mini Kane and Always Core are lined and have padded regular width shoulder strap.\n\nMini Kane is made of fabric used for most school backpacks; tough and long lasting.  The padding is on the backside, bottom, and part of the sides.  It is meant to protect the tablet.  However, the main compartment has no tablet sleeve or a zip pouch.  The outside pocket is slightly gusseted but not meant for any bulky item (won't zip up).  The side pockets have velcro tabs but the sewing is sub-part (mine is already unraveling).  If you have a big Android phone, the pocket may be too small for it.  Sunglasses without case is fine though.  The satiny webbing is also sewn on the strap that you can affix a biner or two.  Because the webbing is satiny, it is hard to have it stay at the length you desire.  To fix it, just use a 1\" safety pin to not having to adjust shoulder straps.\n\nIf you are looking for a fashion backpack that doesn't look like a school pack and is comfortable to carry, this is a good choice.  The dino camo is brilliant!  It is the reason I bought it (because I already have Roxy Always Core and Jansport Half Pint).  I just got a pterodactyl pin before I found this backpack.  It was fate.

I ordered a size small for him based on the sizing chart and other reviewers recommendations. When they arrived he was initially unhappy with the color, as they appear far more yellow than khaki. However, he tried them on and said they were comfortable so he would be fine wearing them.\n\nThe shorts are very long, and they reached halfway past his knees, but for some reason the crotch area was very tight, almost as if they were made for a woman's physique... Everything was on full display, and the seam in the middle of the shorts was dividing 'things' VERY obviously. (Google 'moose knuckle' if you're unsure what I'm trying to allude to.) It was a bit ridiculous how much was on display!\n\nI would have chalked it up to the sizing being off, and ordered him a larger size in another color, but I had ordered my dad a pair of the same shorts in an extra large and he had the exact same problem. The shorts fit correctly everywhere except for the crotch area. The length, waist, and butt area fit fine, but you'd have to be a woman to wear these and not turn a few heads! Yikes!\n\nUnfortunately I ended up returning both pairs, which was disappointing because they were a great price.\nAs an addicted Amazon buyer, I rely on real people's opinions to make educated decisions about what items are worth it to spend my hard-earned money on. Because of this, I aim to leave good, informative reviews for others!
