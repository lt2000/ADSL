Lightweight for summer to wear alone or under a tee-shirt. Spaghetti straps are thin & will roll but not as bad as the Zenana brand that I tried before & they stay put pretty well in comparison. As stated in original ad they are long so you can layer them easily for a bit of color peeking out at the waist. Price very affordable & I would buy again.\n\nUpdate: October 2015- 3rd purchase (2nd with seller Lucky21.) This is the third time Ive bought the Active Basic Camis w/Built-in Shelf Bra through Amazon. The first time was a 2-pak through the seller Lucky 21. They were perfect so I ordered a 4-pak but the 4-pak was only available through one seller DiamondKit-I figured it would be a consistent match as they were titled the same Active Basic Long Camis in Large w/ Built-in Shelf Bra. Boy, was that a wrong assumption. They weren't even Active Basic brand but DiamondKits own & they didn't have a shelf bra but two foam pads sewn in a sling that after one washing was a wadded up mess. So being a PollyAnna trooper I tried again this time I made sure it was through Lucky 21 & I got a 2-pak exactly the same size & listing as the first time I bought them. They fit great & all was well until my back began to hurt from a scratching chaff. Turns out on comparing these to the first ones I bought, these have the elastic straps sewn in backwards so the scratchy heavy duty thread that binds the straps to the halter in back along with the tacked down material rubs against the shoulder blades. The first ones  bought have the straps tacked down facing the halter away from the skin. I don't know why consistency is a problem but I cant seem to get proper Active Basic Camis. Im going to shop around for another brand & hope for a better product.", "summary": "Affordable & Comfortable (see 2nd-3rd purchase experience for update)", "unixReviewTime": 1429228800}

It is, at best, made of average material, some might say it is slightly below-average material, but it seems pretty standard to me. It is not a super-thick t-shirt, again, at best, it is average thickness or maybe slightly below-average in thickness. And due to the fact it is made of average or below-average material, I have no doubt that after repeated washing, the letters will start to crack and flake off.

The lace is so soft and delicate and it has a full under-dress so there is no need for a separate slip. I love the deep blue color and the lace has a slight shine to it catching the light to show the detail. I'm 5'4 and hit hits just at the top of my knee while the V neck is modest with scalloped edges and the arms (my arms are a little flabby from weight loss) fit perfect.\nThe workmanship seems nice trying it on, no bunching in otherwise straight seems and the seems all feel sturdy at this point I would definitely recommend this to anyone my size or slightly under.  .", "summary": "Beautiful but size 10 not plus!", "unixReviewTime": 1435363200}

Makes you think you're getting cancer just by holding it in your hands. I didn't except a high quality, since it is only $14, but I expected a little bit more than this.\nBesides the smell, it's too big. I am 175 cm (5.7\") tall and weigh 53 kg (116lb). Usually I am a size S, so that's what I ordered, but it's still too big, especially around the hips. In the picture it makes it look like the dress is kinda tight, which makes it look sexy/elegant but in reality it's just too loose.\nI have ordered multiple times clothes from similar sellers/that were coming from China and was never disappointed.

The one drawback is the little zipper pouch is kind of small and detaches; I guess you could use it as a wallet for money and your id, but I don't. I think I have a pen in there, but it doesn't add to the bag for me (thus the 4 stars). This is a nice size bag though, I love the more sophisticated color palette and the open, easy access (particularly now that we have to carry the Epipen everywhere).

I HATE that women's long sleeve shirts are a ridiculous thin material and if they are not super thing, they are chunky cardigans or knit sweaters with knit gaps too large to offer any real warmth. I am on a quest for quality warm long sleeve shirts without resorting to filling my winter wardrobe with chunky shrugs and holey shirts. Since that is basically impossible to find in Central IL where I live, I resorted to online shopping despite my dislike that i cannot actually see the item to test the material or size.\n\nNow that being said, I love this shirt. I was elated to find the material is heavier than traditional thin long sleeve shirts, not holey like a big knit, and warm. Its not QUITE as warm as I would like, as anything thats not 75 degrees outside is cold to me. It doesn't do much to make my petite frame look less so, but thats normal for me. However, it is the first shirt to actually meet what I was looking for. I love the pattern, its not plain or over the top. Perfect. At a mall this shirt would have been on average, $30 or if it was Buckle a ridiculous $65 and I would have mourned its loss (no way would I pay irrational prices like!).\n\nIt received four out of five stars for just one reason: Its a bit short in the torso. I'm 5'3'' and 125 lbs so I thought I would have been a fairly close fit to the size.

I thought wow this is a weird little pendant that has on it with the \"Nugz\" label. However after I looked around on the post and really understand a hundred percent what it was,I thought it was super cool. Pretty much you can make it into any bracelet you want, for any ensemble you're wearing. They have a bunch of interchangeable snaps that you can buy to replace uneven glass flaps which I thought was pretty cool. I can't wait to order a couple more snaps. I like the fact that they even have snaps four different types of styles. The bracelet itself is pretty nice call Mo however I wish it was all staying silver. However, it is just silver plated. I looked on the description and couldn't figure out if it was silver-plated what comma however it would be cool if it was silver-plated stainless steel. There are three ropes that connect each band, and it is held together by a \"T\" piece and a loop that it connects to. There are multiple loops to adjust the bracelet to your size wrist. It's kind of hard to get it on at first, and I was worried that I might not be able to get it off single-handedly, however it's much easier to get off than it is to get on. It is a little heavy, and is not very dainty so definitely not for someone who doesn't mind having something larger around their wrists. It seems pretty heavy duty and hasn't turned my wrist green yet so I am happy with this purchase and can't wait to try out some different style.

We were gifted a set of 2 and I didn't use them much when my baby was a newborn because we went through burp cloths like crazy and mostly used those thick prefold diapers (by Gerber and Dundee).  Once my baby was about 3 months, we had washed the prefolds so many times, they started to feel stiff and scratchy.  The Zebi cloths actually get softer and softer with washing.  Some people reviewed that they were too thin.  They are thin, but they are plenty large enough that you can fold in half or even quarters to give you more thickness.\n\nAt 3 months he started showing early signs of teething and was drooling non stop.  He hated the scratchy prefolds on his face, but doesn't mind these super soft Zebi cloths.  We started to use them so much that I purchased another set of them.  They are plenty absorbent, and due to their size and light weight, they are far more versatile than a prefold.  I've used them in a pinch as a carseat cover, a lap blanket, and even a teether.  He likes to suck on it, and since it's organic, I have no problem with him putting it in his mouth.\n\nThese have become a \"must-have\" for us.  We always have one in the diaper bag, and I pretty much have one permanently attached to my shoulder.  As an added bonus- the colors and patterns are ADORABLE.  By far, the cutest ones out there.  Now that my baby is old enough to start responding to shapes, he enjoys looking at the bold patterns.\n\nIn summary: we have gotten MORE use out of these than prefold diapers, and I highly recommend them.", "summary": "We LOVE our Zebi Burp Cloths!", "unixReviewTime": 1409011200}

This is an ambitious device meant to, besides showing the time of the day, day of the week and today's date, also act as an alarm clock, stopwatch, countdown timer (ground control to major Tom), dual-time display for another city, pedometer, calorie counter and compass. And it's backlit too. The watch is shock resistant and water resistant and it's quite comfortable to wear which surprised me as it is quite large, the dial surrounded by thick 'protection' with 5 not so small buttons too.\n\nControlling and using something this complicated and controlling it through button presses is not the easiest thing in the world, therefore the 18-page manual. Yes, it's in English and yes, it could have been done much better but keep in mind that the interface is limited to the 5 buttons and the LCD display. These being said, I found that some features work just great while others, not so much so let's discuss some of them.\n\n- TRADITIONAL WATCH: not much to complain here. It's LCD, of course, and like I said, you get the time of the day 12/24H format, day of week, month and day of month, hour/minute/second, AM/FM if in 12H format and a little icon telling you about the weather outside (sunny, rain, cloudy, etc.). It wasn't easy/breezy to set but it was doable.\n- STOP WATCH, COUNTDOWN: these are okay. You do need to 'learn' how to use them and the manual is not your best friend but they work to some extent.\n- WORLD TIME or DUAL TIME: I believe I could make this work if I spent more time with the manual. It has the ability to show time at 2 locations with a 3-letter abbreviated code for the non-default one.\n- BAROMETER: there seems to be a lot of functionality here such as keeping charts and even showing your approximate elevation but I must admit that, beyond making the little 'sunny' icon showing up on the dial, I wasn't able to get much deeper. Blame the manual and my lack of patience in following the instructions.\n- ALTIMETER: couldn't figure this one out at all but it seems to be there.\n- PEDOMETER, CALORIE COUNTER: I spent some time telling the watch how many pounds I weigh and how tall I am but, in the end, it just didn't work. With or without the manual, it just doesn't work.\n- COMPASS: works great. There is in fact a dedicated button that takes you right into compass mode and it's good. Nice feature.\n- OTHER FEATURES: you can illuminate the dial which is good, select your units as either US or metric which is also good, set your time zone (read the manual very carefully).\n\nBeing as objective as I can, this is not a bad watch at all. It's a lot of learning if you want to use all features but I suspect that this is rarely the case. The manual can be better but it does explain how to do things, only it doesn't do it very well so it requires some time but it's usable if you do one feature at a time. The pedometer and calorie counter just don't work in my view. It's 3 stars because I do believe that this watch has potential and that the 'right' person may love it/want it, therefore my feature-by-feature evaluation above.", "summary": "Has many features, most work well but it's not easy to learn", "unixReviewTime": 1444435200}

The photo has some filter on it to make the colors pop which has altered the base color of the hat in the photo.

The product took almost thirty days to arrive, not that I think this was bad. I ordered it on December 16 and it arrived January 7, too late for Christmas. It was shipped from China and I didn't pay anything to have it mailed to me.\n\nI thought it would make a nice belated gift. Oh, how wrong I was...\n\nUpon arrival I opened the package and found the scarf covered in black specs and gray dust inside it's plastic baggie. When held it up in front of me after unfolding it I discovered that the \"scarf-arms\" were sewn onto the hood at lopsided lengths. BY LITERALLY TWO FEET!\n\nIf I was to adorn this one the hand pockets wound have been just above my knee while the other would have at my naval.\n\nIt was constructed out of poor fabric with no significant cold weather warming qualities as far as I could tell (although soft I admit.) I find it interesting the model in the pictures is wearing this falsely advertised scarf to go with her skirt and T-shirt. and  The stitching was weak and liable to fall apart after moderate use. It smelled like a warehouse reeking of body odor and stale urine, I'm guessing the poor children who made this also live there.\n\nNo point in returning a $11.85 item to China, I tossed it in the garbage can where it fit in nicely with the rest of the filthy trash doomed for possibly a millennia of preservation in our landfills.\n\nI understand there are glowing reviews for this product and they may very well have had a excellent experience. I however did not, and I'm perplexed as to how this is. For about ten bucks and a month of waiting your total losses can't be high, but a sham-job is still a sham-job.\n\nNuff' said...", "summary": "I'm fairly certain I just funded inhumane (as well as incompetent) sweat-shop child labor...", "unixReviewTime": 1422576000}

The gold zipper is very visible and really stands out; I would have preferred something a little softer with a less visible zipper, but that may be a personal preference. There's also a plasticky smell, but that would probably dissipate over time.\n\nTo be fair, there are several nice features too: The laser cutouts are nice and crisp (the side of each cutout is black when viewed at an angle), there are nice little feet on the underside to prevent scratching up the purse, and there is a small D-ring above the handle attachment on each side of the purse, for attaching a longer matching strap which is included. I ordered several items which arrived during a rainstorm, and this was the only one properly wrapped--there was a sheet of thin foam and the purse was wrapped in a plastic bag, so it didn't get ruined like the other items did.\n\nDue to the color and the zipper issues, though, I am returning the purse. If the manufacturer plans to continue using the lot of red material used to make the purse I received, I'd suggest replacing the purse photo with a more accurate one, and revising the color description too--I see this more as a bright lipstick red.", "summary": "Stiff purse, visible zipper, wine-red color is inaccurate", "unixReviewTime": 1439856000}

It fits great and and he loves it!  It is a very nice backpack. The zippers aren't made of a flimsy plastic and seem to be high-quality, durable zippers to withstand the constant zipping and unzipping of little ones.  Another feature that sold me was the padded shoulder straps.  The padding is in fact very plush for a toddler backpack (& esp. compared with others with unpadded canvas straps!).  I know I won't have to worry about my son being uncomfortable and not wanting to wear it on a trip or outing.  The first day we got it my son nearly wore it the entire day and I had to talk him out of sleeping in it.  I also like that it is made from a plastic coated canvas, so I think it will be easy to surface clean.\n\nBut be warned that there are different listings for this same backpack.  I was expecting this backpack to come with a rein for the parent to attach to the silver loop on the top and this came with none.  I see now that this particular listing pays no mention of the \"parent rein\".  I purchased this because I am traveling solo with our three-year old with eight stops in busy airports, so having the parent rein 'just in case' was an important aspect to my purchase of this product and I am very disappointed that the parent rein was not included. I will probably have to get a leash at the pet store for my son now. :/  Also, shipping was taking an extraordinarily long time and I came to find out this was because it was ship internationally from China, so keep that in mind if you are purchasing and want it arrive before a certain date.\nUpdate: Added stars because this backpack has been so durable.

I purchased the boys size for my boys at ages 10 and 12, they are both of the same size, about 80-85lbs. Coming out of the package they look small like something that would fit a 5 or 6 year old. Keep in mind that these are  made of knit which stretch. These boxers should be able to fit a boy from about 40-50lbs up to 90 or more. My boys are still wearing them a year later and love them yet. The detailing will wear off, but for me comfort for my boys was utmost in my mind when purchasing. A year ago when I purchased them they fit like a glove and they do yet which is how they should. It's the way they were made to fit. Also they stay in place with no ride up at all which is a huge plus. I wash them with of all the other clothes in cold or warm water and also dry them in the dryer and they do just fine. I've now purchased the Knocker boxers in the junior one size fits all. They are a little big, but my older boy does wear them. The junior size will fit them great once they get to 100+lbs.

Gave it a 2 star all due to the inaccuracy of their sizing.

My new update is below:\n\n11/17/14: Muqi has been very cooperative and is sending me another jacket that will fit. Their customer service has been very prompt and courteous. This jacket is very cute and it's nice to know that Muqi is doing the right thing for customer satisfaction. As I mentioned in my previous comment on 10/22/14, the sizing of this jacket is quite a bit smaller than U.S sizing but my advice is to order 3-4 sizes larger than what you would normally take.

I am 5'5', 127 pounds with a 29 inch waist. The waistband doesn't dig into my stomach or feel uncomfortable. The legs are long enough even with my 32\" inseam. The colors are bright.\n\nWhat I don't like is that these are that shiny material. I prefer the soft, cottony feeling type. These are also very thin. I wouldn't say this pattern is see through but I don't know how long the leggings will hold up since they are so very thin and lightweight. They are high waisted. I have a short torso so maybe that is why but I don't mind. They go to my naval and don't slip down at all when I sit or squat. I wouldn't wear these for working out because they don't have that stretch that I need. They DO stretch but these are more fashion leggings than tough workout ones, for me anyway.\n\nFor $6.99, they're fine. If I paid $10.99 like the rest are priced, I probably would have gone with 3 stars. But these are cheap, cute, they fit, and certainly won't be too warm on a hot summer day or night.

And the silicone is quite thick and the belt feels well made and should last a long time. Also because the belt is silicone it is very flexible and makes it very comfortable to wear and to clean the belt is super easy.  Also, this belt is REVERSIBLE so you can wear just the black side if you want to tone down the colors and go with a more classic look.\n\nAs for the sizing, my waist is a 32 and I ended up buying both the 34 and 36 with the intent of returning the one that didn't fit. I can tell you the 34 FIT PERFECTLY for me as you can see in my pictures. And the width of the belt is 1.5 inches and should fit practically every belt loop. Here's something I didn't know about belts: From the part of the belt that wraps around the buckle to the middle hole is the size of belt you're buying. For example, the 34 belts middle hole is exactly 34. Also, for this belt, every hole from the middle hole is 3/4 inch up or down rather than a full inch like most of my other belts. And the length of the entire belt from where the belt wraps around the buckle for the 34 is 40 inches and the 36 is 42 inches.

The external fabric was very pretty.\nHowever, it was certainly not as curvy as depicted. This was more of a modern silhouette - which is slender and long, not emphasizing a deep waist. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it should have been in the description. As a curvy woman, the corset was painful and unattractive, even after two weeks of seasoning. It is definitely NOT recommended for any woman with anything more than a boyish figure.\nFinally, after 3-4 weeks of wearing the corset, I decided to try lacing down to about 2 inches reduction (which was very difficult, due to the lack of hip and rib spring). I looked great, but after a couple of hours, I sneezed, and two of the pins burst out. I was in mixed company, and excused myself to the sound of chuckles (the guys thought I had passed gas). Only slightly embarrassing, but certainly not something I want to repeat.\nI would like to reiterate that the corset is NOT as curvy as it looks, but if you are slender through the hips and rib cage, it will probably work out great for you.", "summary": "this corset seemed sturdy and well made (to an extent)", "unixReviewTime": 1443139200}

It arrived within 1 week of ordering. I ordered the Black. When not in use it can fold flat and be stored in the reusable gauze dust cover.\nThe 2 slip pockets and the zipper compartment on the back wall are hidden from view as the second drawstring closure acts as a flap until it is filled. This unique design doubles the security as a second closure. It holds everything I need including a larger wristlet, hairbrush, glass case,phone,little notebooks, and medications. A small computer tablet may fit. Though it was a tight fit it does hold my purse organizer. Negatives: It won't double as a tote ;it is not for the person who needs to carry books or, magazines. The interior is dark,making it harder to find items. The opening drawstring flap hides the interior slip pockets, and the back wall zipper pocket from view which could be a plus for security purposes, or a negative. Some reviews indicate they didn't have the pockets, but it may be the secondary drawstring flap covers them from view. The little pouch snap requires extra effort to close,working best from the top of the snap. There is a slight factory smell which will fade with age hopefully.

Suede is leather.  There is no leather involved in the making of these boots,  They are entirely synthetic, and they smell like plastic.  The photo in the listing is just blurry enough so that you can't really tell, but trust me, in person these are fake micro-suede, and cheap stuff at that.  Second of all, they're very weirdly shaped.  It's as if they weren't designed to really be worn on feet.  The shaft is far too straight and narrow for the size of the foot which is really really wide, but the instep is so low it's really hard to even pull these boots on.  It's like they were made for kids or something...kids with stick legs and wide flat duck feet.  I even ordered a size up from my normal size and still there's just no way these actually fit on the feet of normal humans.\n\nI've bought boots like these before.  Usually they're cheap but ok...I like them.  They're fine for wearing around the house.  I really expected these to be nothing more than cute slipper-boots, but they're not even that.  Plus, I paid way too much for them.  If you pay more than $10, you've paid way too much, and I paid over twice that amount.  You can buy these same boots, made better, at your corner catch-all store for half this price and NO shipping and NO month-long wait.  I'm ok with waiting a long time for good, artisan-made, high quality stuff.  But waiting a month to get a plastic bag of junk in the mail really hurts.\n\nUnwearable AND basically, unreturnable.  Because just try to send stuff back to China...good luck.  When will I learn?  No matter how cute it seems, if it ships from China, it's cheap fake knockoff junk.  Sorry China.

I had intended to wear this over my pants - but probably will end up wearing them as pants in and of themselves.\n\nUPDATE (1/21/2015)\n\nAs of wearing this soft shell in the upper Northern states for a winter, I have to confess that these pants are terrible.\n\n-The material absorbs water. Not even remotely water repellent.\n-They aren't very warm. My poly-pro underlayers are warmer than these.\n-It does little to help against wind. It helps slightly, but not much.\n-Impossibly small to wear, even for a larger size.\n-Pockets. What the heck? No back pockets. The cargo-pockets are microscopic. The actual pockets at the hip are zippered and designed to carry maybe a small wallet and little more.\n-Fabric. Is stretching and giving-out after wearing the pants for little more than a week or so.\n\nSUMMARY.\n\nListen, if these are fabricated with \"Asian size\" in mind ... DON'T SELL THEM TO AMERICAN CUSTOMERS. Most Westerner customers do not like skin-tight clothing. The workmanship is shoddy,\nthe material is flimsy, and the product doesn't even live up to it's stated function: water proof, wind proof, warm. In the end, it's just a really crappy pair of pants that are\nso-so warm, soaks up water, and isn't actually a \"shell\" that fits over your pants - IT BECOMES YOUR PANTS because it's so ridiculously tight.\n\nSave your money, buy this: http://www.amazon.com/Helikon-ECWCS-Trousers-Generation-Black/dp/B005D6DX50/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1421843933&sr=8-3-fkmr1&keywords=ecwcs+goretex+pants+black\n\nOr just get a pair of used surplus military gortex trousers for about $30 if you don't mind wearing camo.", "summary": "Terrible.
