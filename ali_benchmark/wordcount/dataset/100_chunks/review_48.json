Spear", "reviewText": "I ordered this minimalist wallet , more of a card carrier, to replace my five year old leather Fossil bifold wallet. I love leather, I prefer leather, but it was wrecking havoc on my back. It got to the point where I was taking it out of my pocket every time I sat down and was forgetting it in my car or in my house. So, I searched Amazon and came across this bad boy. I really liked the look of it and the price is an absolute steal, so I took a chance.\n\nI recieved it yesterday, loaded it up with three cards, two business cards and ten bills of cash. It is easy to access just what I need, and I can swap out what cards I'll need in the morning. For instance, I only use my library card once every few weeks. So when I know I'm going to thel ibrary I will slip it in. It can fit easily about five more cards, but I like it not being too tight when I extract a card or my cash.\n\nAnyway, I took it out today for the first time. When I got out of my car, I did my usual butt-pat to make sure my wallet was there and I kind of panicked for a second. There was no lump! My pocket didn't feel heavy. I had to actually slip my hand in my back pocket to make sure it was there. This thing is GREAT. I'm going to order a few more varieties. This is now my wallet company of choice and I'm sold. It's excellent.\n\nNOTE : I ordered the red and black model, and I got an all black model. Not a problem, the all black version looks cool, I just didn't get the exact wallet I ordered. I'm not sure if that's Amazon's fault or Fowfold's fault. I noticed on the sealed envelope it came in inside the Amazon box that it didn't specify the color so it might have been an easy mix-up. For the price I paid, it's not worth sending it back and trying to get the right color, I'll just order another one when I'm ready for a change.

I have a unique style so this dress/ shirt fits right into  my wardrobe.\nI started by asking ladies who had already bought this if a small or medium would fit (I am 5'1\" and 105 lbs). I got great advice from other people who bought it who recommended that, even though its short, to get a small because the top geometric portion would be too big and look sloppy. They were right! I got the small and it fits just like it does on the model (give or take :) ).\nI can see some of the stitching on all of the little pieces that make up the geometric top portion, but other than that the lining, zipper and rest of the dress all are well sewn. Its a tad stretchy which is nice as well (around the chest area). Women with larger breasts would probably have a harder time with the dress as it doesn't give a lot of room up top for more than a B cup (which I guess would vary upon what size you bought).\nLastly, the length; it is very short. You definitely wouldn't want to bend over in it. Im going to wear it with black leggings or fun, thicker tights to solve that problem.\nComing from China, it took a couple weeks to get to me, but got here before the date scheduled.\nIm very happy with this.

This one does, the straps length contribute to this.\nAm giving it a 4 star because of the sizing and the straps not being as pictured. Color is true orange. Zipper in the back isn't that smooth.

It also has two deep slip pockects, one on each outside (front & back), as well as a slip and zipper pocket inside. The fact that it is taller than wide, allows for a larger cell phone to easily fit vertically inside, and I can carry more than I expect (keys, small wallet/coin purse, lipstick, cell phone, small hand sanitizer, several folded tissues, and even a few more thin items. It also has a very long adjustable shoulder strap so it can easily be worn crossbody even on a tall person. I have this bag in both black and brown. I wish they made more colors, I would buy more! The leather is soft and of high quality, both the inside & outside slip pockets have a nice lining. Zippers work smoothly and the bag is so light you barely notice you have it on.

Kevin", "reviewText": "The latest is for children to go barefoot as this is better for foot development, or at least that's the thinking this week. We wanted a shoe that gave some traction but was not too stiff. This fits the bill greatly. Our little one does tend to run a little hot so he does sweat with these on but I think he gets that from his mothers side. That said these are perfect for walking around indoors during the winter and outdoors in spring and fall. Maybe a bit warm for summer.\n\n**Update\n\nAfter 3 weeks of use, and barely any detectable wear on the soles, the vinyl fabric holding the compression buckle to the shoe started to wear. First the pleather flaked off which exposed the reinforcement threads. This allowed the reinforcement threads to fray on the edge of the oval loop.(See customer photo above) They are hanging on by a thread and neither the seller nor the manufacturer is willing to exchange them as the 30 days has expired.\n\nIf our little one had started wearing these right as we got them, we would have been inside the 30 days, but alas we were planning ahead and bought them earlier then he was ready to use them. I do not think the design is bad, and we really like the shoes for the first 2 weeks, I think the fabric used is inferior to the wear it receives. The data from the inside of the shoe is as follows.\n\nChina Style # XY8812\nMFG Date 05/2013\nRN#36769\n\nIf you receive similar shoes, with the same date code, I would suggest you return the shoes and ask for a different batch date. Sometimes  this can correct manufacturing or material issues. It is also possible that the sourced fabric is not appropriate at all, which in case would mean they are doomed to fail in similar fashion. I hope the seller or manufacturer steps up and does the right thing with these as the value is not there for 3 weeks of use.", "summary": "Flexable and natural", "unixReviewTime": 1391990400}

My only complaint with this Belt is that right out of the bag it smells kind of bad. I let it air out for a couple of days and the smell went down SIGNIFICANTLY. Then i tried putting it in a bag with one of those Bamboo Charcoal packs to see if that will take the smell away completely. It worked well. I do not think i could wear it out of the bag because i would not want anyone to smell the plastic-y smell. It does a lot better now and i am happy to say that I can wear it without worrying about the smell. The red color is really vibrant and beautiful so, if you can get the smell out i would Highly reccomend it.

The buckle straps will be more secure than a lot of the other designs we saw for attaching tags. I was able to print the information the information we wanted to put on the tag on regular computer paper using a standard label size, and it was easy to slide the computer paper tags into the tag holder between the cardboard tag that was provided and the window. That means we will be able to change the information on the tags very easily. The tags snap closed, so our information can only be seen when the tag is opened. The only thing I might change is to have the tag itself slide into the holder from the inside rather than the outside of the tag, It would make it just a little bit less likely to have the tag fall out of the holder. I love the fact that we had several different cover designs to choose from, and my husband and I ordered different color tags so we can tell our luggage apart at a glance.

I wear a small and there was plenty of room to fit a sweater underneath, plus the sleeves were on the long side so I'd say it runs a little big.

I don't wear rings, but when I decided to get married I had to do something.  So searching around I found this ring -- which I wanted to make my \"practice ring\" just to get familiar with wearing a real one.  The problem was getting the size just right.  Here on Amazon the size chart skipped my size.  I tried the smaller one, I tried the larger one.  Neither worked.  I needed that extra .5 space.  So I contacted Cavalier Jewelers directly and spoke with a rep, named Louis.  This guy was a godsend and if I was the boss of that business he would be getting a raise. He found a ring in my size... the ONLY one they had in stock.  And he said he'd make sure the right size would go out if I ordered the size next to it on Amazon (he'd watch for my name & order and swap the right size into the package).\n\nThe additional problem was that our wedding was within a week -- like just 4 days and Sunday was one days (we were running late as most weddings tend to do). I already placed the order so I couldn't change the shipping.  I was about to buy another ring and ship it Next Day, but Louis said \"No problem,\" so we just had to trust Louis that on our wedding day I'd have at least my practice ring.  Well, he came through in spades.  We got the ring in time and it was a perfect fit.  Cavalier Jewelers, in my opinion is a good seller and worth checking out.  Trust me, I'm not a shill for them, as I said I'm not big on wearing jewelry.  But I'm STILL wearing that ring.  Yes, it's only a $30 dollar ring, but it's the sentiment that matters.  It has held up well, it is strong and it has some heft to it.  People see it and like it. If it wears down (as other reviewers said) then I can simply buy another one at this price.  I know some might find that sacrilege to the institution of marriage, but the ring is a symbol not the actual concept so I'm fine with that.", "summary": "Good ring, even BETTER customer service", "unixReviewTime": 1374710400}

I had to send the first one back since the analog portion of the timepiece kept stopping (second hand would \"stick,\" therefore the larger hands would not advance).  Amazon and Asurion were OUTSTANDING in their prompt service and support handling my return claim.  Since the watch malfunctioned after the normal 30-day replacement window, I had to return the defective watch and re-purchase a new one.  The new one has worked like a champ!\n\nThe features I really enjoy about this watch are the large digital displays, the contrasting colors between the analog hands and the background, the night backlighting system and the easy of setting the time.  The large digital displays are much easier to read than most digital/analog combo watches and the contrast between the background and the analog hands is such that the time is quite easy to read.  I had previously ordered a more \"stylish\" looking Casio watch which had a very nice, clean-looking face.  But the analog hands were thin and shiny silver and the watch face was bright white.  It was nearly impossible to read the time because the hands blended right into the background.  And the digital display was so small the analog hands frequently covered up the numbers.  Not so on this watch!\n\nThe backlight (when activated) is a soothing, unobtrusive color and a mild intensity.  It doesn't blind you in very dark conditions and the digital readout is very easy to see.\n\nI am in the military and frequently \"re-hack\" my watch every couple of days.  On this model you simply press one of the buttons 3 times to enter the time set mode (rather than press & hold some button or combination of buttons for some obscure amount of time), then press one other button to reset the seconds to \"00.\"  It's so easy, you could do it in complete darkness, if you'd like.  It's not a perfect time-keeper (but then it was only an $18 watch!), but it's typically not off more than a second or so per week.\n\nI guess my only complaint would be the \"luminescent\" analog hands.  They are very, very dim, even in total darkness.  They can be read, but you have to look very closely to see them.  This typically is not an issue though, since you always have the backlight function available if you need it.\n\nOverall, I am very pleased with this watch as a low-cost, work watch.", "summary": "Great watch for a very reasonable price!", "unixReviewTime": 1446854400}

But it wasn't for me.\nJudging by the fact that there was no place for a battery in the back and all I saw were watch gears instead, I gathered it was a wind-up watch. I could not find in the directions any way to wind it up. Apparently the main twisting piece on the side has three \"settings\" which are very hard to distinguish between and one of them may have been the one to wind the watch. I could never tell if it was working or not.\nThe other on the same side are, in my opinion, badly placed on the watch. I work with my hands and my wrists get bumped a lot and, as a result, so does my watch. These buttons were pushed a lot accidentally while at work which was very inconvenient. Also, while at work, an especially large bump to my watch CAUSED THE GLASS PIECE COVERING THE FACE OF THE WATCH TO FALL OFF.

Fortunately, the watch was not damaged. At first glance, it has a bit of a Carrera (<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/TAG-Heuer-Men-s-CV2010BA0794-Carrera-Black-Dial-Watch/dp/B001GBMO0Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">TAG Heuer Men's CV2010BA0794 Carrera Black Dial Watch</a>) design to it, but without the luxury quality. That being said, everything about the watch case looks more expensive than it really is. The dial details are impressive, with the sole exception of the date window, which is a little too small for the date wheel numbers. Also, the dual second hands aren't exactly in sync, but I suppose this can make the watch look like an automatic chronograph at first glance (auto-chronos usually cost over $1000, so this can be a good thing). The glass scratches easily, which is to be expected with a mineral crystal.  The pushers for the month and day functions are good quality, but the crown mechanism is poorly made. It does have three positions: manual wind, date, and time set, but I feel like a few gears are going to break unless I am very gentle with it.  The exhibition case back and Kr&ouml;nen & S&ouml;hne rotor engraving are nice touches, and the mechanical self-wind movement keeps reasonably good time (gains about 4 seconds per day), though I would be cautious with quality control from a Chinese manufacturer.  The power reserve is good, but I haven't exactly measured it. It'll definitely last overnight.\n\nThe case says it's water resistant, but based on its appearance, I wouldn't test it. It can probably handle a few rain drops but definitely not being submerged.  You get what you pay for.\n\nThe stainless steel bracelet looks great, but the build quality is average at best.  The links are loose, and the steel brushing isn't very good, though the double locking fold-over clasp was a pleasant surprise.  In retrospect, I probably should have purchased the same watch but with a leather band (Also on Amazon).\n\nThe watch is eye-catching, and has received a lot of compliments.

The color isn't an in your face pink. Its more of a light baby pink. The fit is spot on, perfect, and so comfortable that I forget Im wearing it. I don't have to take it off while doing any kind of household chores or things of that nature. This ring is beautiful and tough. Not a scratch on it since Ive been wearing it 24/7. I love this ring so much that I bought the other 2 colors in this collection - purple and blue. Just to switch things up every now and again. If you're looking for something delicate thats just a bit unusual, Id say this is the ring for you. Its very versatile. I use it as a wedding band, but I don't see why it couldn't be a stackable ring or a right hand ring...even an eye catching thumb or pinky ring. Ive even heard of people using these as toe rings. The possibilities go as far as your imagination. Makes a great gift.", "summary": "Adorable!", "unixReviewTime": 1521072000}

The old pair was a nice spandex with actual leather grips (said leather is now peeling and cracking). It worked well for my winter/cold weather dog walking needs. I figured another similar pair would be just fine. Well, Nope. They've changed their design so instead of the nice smooth, stretchy spandex (like yoga pants), it's a rougher texture and just a little bit stretchy. Okay fine. I can deal with that since I really needed just a pair of lightweight gloves for cool morning walks so my hands don't freeze off holding the flexi-leash. What I really DO NOT like is the old leather grip has been replaced with something akin to rubber (or a plastic-y rubber-like material). It most certainly does NOT grip the leash at all. I now find myself holding onto it with a vise-like grip of death which makes my hand cramp. I'm sure this new material was far more \"cost-effective\" for Isotoner than using half-way decent leather, but it's s***ty. Rubber, when cold, has none of the traction it's otherwise known for as I've experienced first-hand thanks the my city adding rubber pavers to the crosswalks, which become a virtual \"slip&slide\" when it snows. I'm glad these are not driving gloves because I would have no control of the wheel as it would slide right through my hands. They are \"sort of\" warm-ish, but I would never use them for Cleveland winter walks in single digit temps (I have another pair of Columbia fleece gloves for that). These work for the 40-50 degree weather and not much below. Purchase with caution.", "summary": "Not enough grip, so-so warmth.", "unixReviewTime": 1446336000}

The costume is, of course, considerably \"inaccurate\" if you're just watching the series by itself. This aside, it's gorgeous, and I found it worth every cent (because -surprise- I actually bought it). Now, the colors of the recon core symbols are B&W, and so is the scarf. These are the only 'abnormalties,' and if you're not okay with that I wouldn't suggest this product.\nIf you'd just Google \"Attack On Titan Manga,\" and viewed almost any of the results, you'd see that Mikasa's scarf is BLACK, not RED in the original. You'd also see that the B&W symbols are accurate, also.\n\nBut, if you are okay with that, I have some advice and some greatness to share with you. The shipping was amazing and arrived over a week earlier than the ETA. If you don't know how to assemble the belts, you could break a part of them, but ten seconds of hand-sewing can fix that.\nMy biggest suggestion is that you lie about your size- and I don't mean to make yourself smaller, but bigger. I fudged my sizes to be a little bigger, and the pants were still kinda tight on me. The other thing is that the white used in the shirts and pants are almost see-through, which is another reason to fudge your sizes, because then you could wear a pair of white leggings instead of searching for skin-colored undies all over Walmart or Amazon. Also, there's real beltloops on the pants, so if you oversize on accident, you can use a belt. I'd also suggest an undershirt for the shirt, because it has the same problem of being see-through.\n\nOther than that- despite of that- I really Love this costume! The majority of it fits well and it's really warm- which isn't perfect for warmer cons or events, but it is for Winter events like Halloween or any of the cons through March and February months.\n\nAbout the price, it's really good. If you view the other search results on this site, people are trying to sell cloaks and jackets alone for up to $50. This includes a full costume, both the cloak and Jacket for only $110ish. It's worth it in my opinion, and if you want a really good Cosplay, I'd suggest this.\n\nPeace", "summary": "Pleasant, but not ignorant.", "unixReviewTime": 1382140800}

It's just the right size too, half way between a clutch and a small wallet. Perfect for me and should nicely fit in my smaller purse. I like the snap closure for the most part. It has two holes in which to snap the wallet shut, which may make it easier when the wallet is a little thicker. The only dislike, which is not that serious, is I have to move it around a little to find a hole for the snap closure.\n\nThe company doesn't waste any time shipping out your purchase and I got it much sooner than expected. They are also good at responding to refund requests. I know because the first clutch style wallet I ordered from them had a broken zipper pull, which fell off when I just touched it, because the metal ring attaching the pull had somehow been damaged.

Regular cotton boxer briefs were not cutting it (too much sag) and I'd constantly be trying to adjust myself to compensate. I read the reviews and was somewhat concerned about the quality so I decided to buy three separate brands to compare quality with price. These \"7 Pack Mens Multicolor 3d Clipping Fit Stretch Boxer Briefs\" were the cheap ones, mid was \"2 Pack Kronis Low Rise Trunks Soft Cotton Microfiber\", and high end was \"Calvin Klein Men's Micro Modal Boxer Brief\".\n\nI purchased this 7-Pack in April 2015 and have held up well over the last six months. They are light, provide the extra separation I was wanting, and for the money, are very reasonable. Most boxer briefs in this category are a lot more expensive. They just started to get pin sized holes in one or two of the seams, but for the money I'm very happy with them. They were however, not my favorite brand.\n\nThe winner by far was the Kronis. The Kronis boxers feel amazing. They are not very long, however my thighs don't rub together so it wasn't an issue for me. After about a month I altogether stopped wearing my cotton boxer briefs and bought more Kronis, even though they were more expensive. They're worth every cent! The CK boxer briefs are nice (make your package look huge for some reason), however it wasn't as supportive or comfortable in my opinion as the Kronis or 7-Pack.\n\nIf you're looking for some inexpensive boxer briefs, I would recommend this 7-Pack. I gave it 5 stars as they have held up over the last 6 months and are well worth the money. They're SO much better than cotton. - However, if you want to spend a little more money for great quality and a very comfortable boxer brief, go with the Kronis. If you want your junk to look great and have the extra cash, CK is your best bet. I actually wear CK the least because they're not as comfortable and I'm married so no one cares what my package looks like. :)", "summary": "Overall worth the buy, but not my #1 pick.", "unixReviewTime": 1448582400}

I noticed on the bag that these were once marked \"XL\", and only received a sticker on top of that one that said \"L\" which was the size I ordered. The first one proved to be too large, and the others were slightly too small, though I'm sure that the two were the correct size and the other was really an \"XL\", even though all their printed-on tags said \"L\". I also found that there is an odd bit of sewing in between and at the top of the cups, where a piece of thread is straining the lace that it's trying to hold up. I cut the thread on one bra, and found that the lace isn't long enough to go above the edge of the rest of the bra for that promised \"peek-a-boo\" (seeing the lace while wearing a top) that every Milana Genie is supposed to have. My officially real Milana Genie bra doesn't need nor does it have a thread that forces it to go beyond the rest of the bra, its lace fits perfectly over it and doesn't fall down, unlike the three I bought here. These bras don't look like the picture provided, nor do they come all that close to the genuine Genie bra that I have. I can't wear these anywhere accept to bed and around the house because of the poor fit, shape, and the lack of a working camisole effect, since they give you a chest wrinkle if you never cut the thread holding up the lace.

Makes everything difficult. When i was 135lbs before my pregnancy these were perfect in medium. Today 8 months after a difficult (is there an easy??) Pregnancy, im still at 148 lbs..the large is super comforting and flattering.\n\n2. Compared to all expensive brands ive purchased, these are by far best quality and fit my figure best. My hips are wide from the front and very narrow from the side...i gain most of my weight in the belly and upper side hip. These accomodate exceptionally well. No discomfort and ill likely use them rigorously in future pre/post pregnancy and during fit time in between.\n\n3. The clothe fits the calves and give minor sexy flare. They are closer to leggings with more ankle boot room than flared yoga pants. Ideal for yoga, running, lounge, hikes. Protection and flexability with supurb fabric quality you cant find in sewing shops (and ive looked to try to more frugally replicate).\n\nIn short...i don't know if you'll like them if you are short. The fabric may not expand if you don't need the length..but i cant guantee that.

All it takes is a slight push and the tension clip comes off and the belt buckle falls right off.  I have caught it twice right before it fell into the toilet and one time it missed by 2 inches.

I ordered my size and wound up a little snug.  Now they offer to fix that, I never really took them up on it, but it's the same offer Slidebelts makes.\n\nThe ratcheting mechanism on the Eazybelt I prefer significantly.  It's MUCH quieter than the slidebelt.  Now to be fair, the slidebelt I got may not represent every type of buckle they offer, but when you cinch up the eazybelt, it's very quiet.  The slidebelt is very noisy in comparison.\n\nAs for the belt itself, the leather is thick and looks like high quality.  The slidebelt leather doesn't \"look\" as nice but interestingly it SMELLS of leather.  My wife said this has more to do with how the leather is finished then necessarily the quality of the leather, so I don't know what to say there, but I do like the actual leather smell that the slidebelt has.\n\nMy only flaw that I see on both belts is really it's Achilles heel.  The spot where the belt buckle attaches to the end of the belt (the non-ratcheting part) is small.  I don't know what the thinking was, but there are only 5-6 little pins in the middle on both belts that hold the buckle to the belt.  After some wear, I've found it to wear down, start twisting a bit and eventually even tear loose causing me to have to cut a 1/4 inch off to secure it again.  I've also had a few times where it will just pop loose if the belt gets pushed into the buckle by accident and suddenly the buckle is on the floor or hanging off the ratcheting mechanism.  Anyway, my main annoyance with it.  I was able to fix the issue by wedging a piece of cardboard into the end of the buckle mechanism to keep it from popping loose, but wish it did that better on it's own.  There is no torsion on that piece for some reason so it really can be problematic.\n\nOverall thought I still like both these belts.  This belt is thicker and I really prefer the ratcheting mechanism.  The Slidebelt comes in a much fancier case and seems to be a nicer leather, but the ratcheting mechanism is annoyingly loud.", "summary": "EazyBelt vs SlideBelt", "unixReviewTime": 1409097600}

First, I can say that after over more than 60 years of belt-wearing experience, I find this design in a class by itself.\n\nI want to pass on a few tips that I hope will make your experience with it enjoyable right from the start, should you buy one.  Whatever your waist size always order a length at least 4 inches longer.  Once you get the belt and decide how much belt you want extending beyond the buckle, simply cut the buckle-end of the belt to make a satisfactory length.  Don't worry about cutting off the depressions you see made by the buckle holding spikes.  Personally, I think when the buckles spikes penetrate a fresh surface, they make a better hold on the belt.\n\nSome learning is required to unbuckle the belt.  Just remember that the swivel release-latch is on the bottom right of the buckle. Hold the buckle with one hand and swing the release latch OUT away from your body, while simultaneously with the other hand shove the belt IN toward the buckle.  It took me a couple of weeks to get this pattern down in my mind.  Hopefully, you will know it right from the start.  That's swing the latch OUT, push the belt IN.\n\nFurther, I like the belt because it's clean in understatement, with the focal point being the buckle.  It can be worn with anything.  There are no distracting holes, or places for frictional wear to show.  The ratcheting system allows for 1/4 inch size adjustments.  Tightening requires only pushing the belt into the buckle.  Loosening requires only swinging OUT the latch while pushing IN the belt, then holding the latch and letting the belt slide out.  I just marvel at how easy these adjustments are, anytime, anywhere.  No one will ever see you unbuckling and rebuckling again.  And the belts - in my opinion, at least -  are by far the best, and for unbelievably low prices.", "summary": "Best belt for unbelievably low price", "unixReviewTime": 1424131200}

The aggressiveness on the toe makes overhang climbing easier, well IMO.\n\nSizing:\nIf the initial size fits perfectly, I would recommend going down a half size. It may be a little tight at first but it will mold into a perfect fit. I do this because I do not like any dead space throughout the shoe.\n\nPricing:\nAmazing value for the price. No other shoe in the market will provide you with incredible performance and durability for a low price.", "summary": "Take It To The Next Level", "unixReviewTime": 1411430400}

My street size (10) is the absolute tightest I can get my feet into. If you're looking for a more relaxed fit, I would size up by a 1/2 size. I have pretty wide feet for my size, so I didn't find the toe box to be particulary loose. In fact, it feels tight to me. Having said that, I don't notice any discomfort when I'm climbing. I guess my brain is more focused on \"don't fall,\" rather than \"man, my toes hurt.\" I just climbed in the Gunks with them yesterday and compared to the last time I climbed there, I felt like I was cheating. The stiffer toe made it easy to step up on the tiniest footholds and the sticky soles let me apply opposing force on a corner crack without slipping at all. I'm still very much a beginner and the one thing I noticed is that the sticky (see soft) rubber at the tip of the toe is wearing away.

I bought three pairs, two as gifts.  My only negative comment is that one is made a bit differently than the other two.  The difference is in the leather (one seems more 'worn in' than the other two), and the fleece lining isn't as uniform in density and length of the wool fiber.  Possibly the nature of the hide from which the mittens are made, but the contrast will lead me to return the 'odd' one.\n\nWhich leads to another comment.  I once had a pair of faux sheepskin mittens that were the warmest mittens I've ever had, but, even though faux sheepskin gloves are available, mittens apparently are not; I can't find them anywhere, in store or on the internet.

So overall, I could have gone a size down.\nI ended up taking in a little under the arm, removing the annoying (and visible) pads in the bust area and actually discreetly sewing the sleeveless side to my padded bra so that it would not slip when I partied. I do not have any sewing experience and did the adjustments by hand with a regular $1 needle and thread sewing kit...15 minutes. I was not sure whether it would work, but this dress arrived on the day of the party and I did not have a plan B.\nEverything turned out great. I looked and felt sexy. I got many compliments and no one would know of the little work I did to bring it up to scratch.", "summary": "The bottom was good though not as fitted as in the photo (which ...", "unixReviewTime": 1418601600}

I believed them, and wanted a looser fit, so where I normally wear an XS-S in US sizes, I ordered a large in this item, and it is enormous on me.  I'm 5'2, 120, and could've easily fit a small, and probably could've made a medium work with a few minor adjustments.  So this item might run on the small side of US sizes, but don't go wildly sizing up on it or anything.\n\nThat said, the product itself is really quite nice, I'm really disappointed it didn't fit so I can't use it this weekend like I wanted to. The fabric is light, but doesn't feel cheap or chintzy.  It's got a nice drape.  The pattern is adorable without being overly cutesy, and it is more navy than it looks in pictures on my screen, anyway.  The shorts, I found, were long, but that could've been a result of my crazy up-sizing.  The buttons seem well attached and the hems are straight without any hanging threads or anything.  The waist has a fake drawstring tie on the front, but it doesn't actually do anything, the waist is elastic.  It opens plenty far to get it off and on without an issue.  And it has pockets, which is always a plus in my book.\n\nThe one thing I do have a grip about, and this has less to do with the product, more with the shipping, is it came shipped to me in a gallon-sized Ziplock bag, like someone had purchased it, tried it on, lost the plastic bag it came in, shoved it in the first bag they found from their kitchen, and returned it.  It didn't look or feel or smell like it had been worn or anything, my guess is tried on and exchanged or returned, but it was still very strange to receive a Ziplock bag (with like, a Ziplock pattern on it and the blue slide closure; this wasn't a Ziplock-type bag that the company uses to ship things).\n\nOverall, I love this romper, and may reorder in the correct size.", "summary": "and could've easily fit a small", "unixReviewTime": 1475798400}

The bracelet also has a strange twist at one point which looks to be a seam or joining between two longer chains, which could just be a one off from manufacturing, i.e. having a long spool of the braid before cutting to size - my luck to catch the bracelet with the seam - or it could also be the result of a particularly bad catching of the unclosed links. Either way, it not really noticeable, I just happen to know its there. All in all, it's a nice bracelet, very masculine without looking garish, and as I said the braid feels good on the wrist.

To this day Im still amazed that he asked me to go out with him. I fretted over that first date for a week and did all of the things that you do when you have a first date with an Adonis. I wish there were a lot of details that I could skip over here but frankly, there aren't  my beautiful fringed scarf got caught in the door of the car, the valet started driving off, and I was unceremoniously humiliated and almost strangled before we were ever greeted by the matre d. The Adonis did eventually call me again (and I ended up stealing enough of his sweatshirts over the following year that he had to marry me to regain custody of them), but I had sworn off wearing long warm scarves forever. The Simplicity Neck Warmer Infinity Scarf is the perfect way for me to get all of the cozy warmth of a beautiful neck scarf, without risking near-death and total embarrassment at the hands of an overworked valet.\n\nThis beautiful scarf is made in a texture-patterned knit that feels lightweight but provides exceptional warmth. At 23 inches long it gently drapes at the neck creating a flattering neckline that works perfectly with any coat or jacket. 16 inch width allows for coverage of my neck and chest, and can be drawn up to cradle my jawline and ears, or my entire head, when it is really chilly outside. The delightfully soft acrylic knit maintains shape and doesnt sag or get stretched out from use. This scarf is also extremely versatile  it can be worn in a multitude of ways to suit the weather, or to give any outfit a fashion-forward update.\n\nI received a sample of the Simplicity Winter Warmer Infinity Scarf at no cost in exchange for an unbiased review and love the beautiful design, the high-quality material, and I especially love how wonderfully versatile it is (and that Im safe from hurried valets)!", "summary": "Gorgeous warm knitted Infinity Scarf that creates a flattering neckline, is well-made, and is extremely versatile!", "unixReviewTime": 1448755200}

I love this wallet because the cards will never fall out since the opening fro the card slots are facing inward when folded, there is also some rubbery grip on the inside of the card pockets because nylon is super slipper, this keeps the cards snug. I also LOVE how there are only two card slots without material in between each card, making the wallet the thinnest I have ever seen even when fully packed.\n\nThe only thing I was worried about was that this wallet would not look classy since it is made from nylon, and I was wrong. I feel like the nylon pattering on the wallet looks more elegant and clean than leather does and it doesn't end up looking like a kids wallet.\n\nI had the leather version of this same \"sport wallet\" from ALL-ETT before I purchased this one. I like the nylon version much better. In the leather version the nylon and the leather seemed at odds with each other and the stitching connecting the two materials came apart after 3 years of use. I like the nylon version better because it is thinner and it doesn't have the same seam as the leather version where the stitching came apart at the edges, so I anticipate it will last much longer.\n\nFor such a good price I am VERY happy with the quality.", "summary": "This will be my go to wallet for life now.

If you are looking for a dress/gown, buy from this company.  Their product looks and feels better than the more expensive dress/gown in the bridal shops and with these great prices, you can look amazing and have a different dress for every occasion.

Today I wore them as regular panties as it was laundry day, my panty line is completely chaffed and I'm in pain, single most uncomfortable panties I'VE WORN TO DATE!! Short periods of time are fine, longer than an hour and it gets uncomfortable, all day wear is a new form of torture technique, no joke.\n\n2) the material this is made from is absolutely horrible smelling, because of the material if you wear these all day expect a horrible blend of crotch rot odor mixed with plenty of burning rubber smell, they smell absolutely horrible, and I normally don't smell, even down there, as I practice exquisite hygiene due to my OCD for such odors.

I'm going to contact the manufacturer to see if they any suggestions on how to open it and fix the zipper, or if they will replace it. If they do nothing then I will probably drop my rating to one star as I will have to buy another after less than 6 months of owning it.\n\nUpdate 9/6/14: The company replaced my wallet for free. So I've upped my rating by a star for good customer service. The new wallet is several shades lighter tan than the original and the one pictured here, but that does not bother me; however, others may want to know that the color may vary a bit. We ended up cutting the original wallet to get my stuff out as the zipper teeth held strong despite having a tug of war with it.

When I go surfing, I strap this watch right on top of my wetsuit. When I go lap swimming, I have this watch on. At the gym, while I fish, while I snowboard, on my backpacking trips, camping trips, hikes, you name it. Even in the shower. I rarely take this watch off - only to let my wrists air out once in awhile overnight.\n\nI've had this watch for nearly four years now, and it finally broke on me last week. Well, namely, the bottom strap where the strap meets the small metal spring-loaded attachment tube. It was my fault really.. I was.. in an impromptu, friendly wrestling match with my friend and we got too rough. I believe too much pressure was applied on the watch strap, and it snapped at the point of contact to the main watch computer.\n\nWell, the watch still works - I just need to buy a replacement strap. In conclusion.. great watch - really built tough. If you plan on entering saltwater with this watch, just make sure you rinse it with freshwater after (i.e. just wear it into the shower). Some white powdery buildup may appear after a year or so, so just get some toilet paper and a toothpick to get it out. Overall, sturdy watch. Although it does look a little bulky if you're a relatively skinny person. I'm only 5'9 and 150lb and I sometimes felt this watch was a tad bulky on me (gets in the way while wearing fitted dress shirts, tighter long-sleeves, etc). But still got a few compliments on the watch.\n\nBut in the end, I think what matters most is the wearer of the watch - and I was definitely satisfied with this watch, especially since it was so affordable. $45 for a watch that can last you 4 years (and counting) through hell and back?

Always looking for that perfect solution. For years I carried a large hipster because I tend to carry allot of cards and cash. That quickly became a pain in the you know what. Literally. So I started my minimalist journey. I really like the Bellroy wallet line and have a couple of those. The problem was there is still too much leather. I read about a rubber band being the best wallet of all time but I didn't like having what I was carrying completely exposed to every stranger's casual gaze.  And after all it was just a rubber band. Not very sophisticated. Money clips and other small wallets couldn't hold enough cards. Then I saw the Moneywrap. I've had it a couple weeks now and I think it may actually work out. It's rubber band meets the leather wallet. It can handle the 10 cards I carry and cash easily. It took a little getting used to for me but it's become pretty natural now and I can handle my cards and cash now without dropping something when I open the moneywrap. A little pricey for a strip of leather, a stretchy band one might use to put their hair in a pony tail and a clip to hold the band to the leather strip. It does come with two extra stretchy bands as those will likely wear out much quicker than the leather piece. But it works. Pretty clever actually. I bought another one so I would have a spare.\n\nNovember 21, 2015 update\n\nI don't normally provide updates but I felt like it was warranted to help make sure the money wrap doesn't get a bum wrap. As one of the reviewers mentioned the money wrap is small but that is the intent IMO. This is a minimalists wallet. I also don't blame the other reviewer's first impression. This is small and appears to not be very secure. But after 6 weeks of use the wallet does work although in a non traditional way so it takes some getting used to. I have 10 cards and 16 bills in mine right now and it's no where near maxed out. If you get this you need to be prepared to have an open mind, really give it an honest try and want a minimalist wallet. I plan on using mine as my primary carry for the foreseeable future. But again, I want the smallest wallet possible that can still hold allot of cards and bills.", "summary": "Pretty Cool", "unixReviewTime": 1444867200}

I needed replacement behind-the-head ear muffs that I wear over the ear-flaps of my winter fleece cap.  I like the added layer of warmth, and without a chin strap, the ear muffs keep the wind from sneaking in under the flaps and giving me ear aches.\n\nWhen I saw these for such a remarkable price, I decided I'd give them a try - and without any choice of color, I ordered two at once.  They came with reasonable delivery time considering the distance and cost - about the earliest \"expected\" delivery date.  Both pair were back.  The salient points if you are considering these for your gear:\n\n1. They are the lightest weight of any ear muffs I have ever tried.  The frame is not plastic as I have come to expect, but a tough and resilient single-wire loop that forms the ear cups and then crosses over between them to form the connecting bridge.\n\n2. They are contoured to fit my head - with a well-defined \"up-and-down\" geometry.  The \"up\" side is wider, to fit the cranium, the \"down\" side is narrower, to conform to the narrowing of the neck.  I have not tried to re-shape them, but I suspect it may be possible that the wire framing.\n\n3. They do NOT fold - unlike most plastic-framed models that have a hinge rivet and can fold because of it.  On the other hand, my other pair of ear muffs broke at that hinge rivet because of the inherent weakness at that kind of stress point.\n\n4. They do NOT telescope/slide wider or narrower - again, because they are a solid-wire frame inside.  Then again, once properly adjusted, they won't be accidentally changing on you, either.\n\n5.  At the same time as I ordered two pair of these ear muffs that took a few weeks to ship, I also ordered a far more expensive name brand that is highly rated and came via \"Prime.\"  I do like it, and it IS a higher grade of construction and materials - but I got TWO pair of these Womdee ear muffs for about 1/3 the cost (with shipping included) as the \"fancy\" ear muffs - and while I have ended up using both kinds, my Womdee muffs are seeing more action these days.\n\nSo, to wrap up my own experience, I two pair of these for a very low price - and I am glad I did - and find them perfectly suited to adding an extra layer outside the ear-flaps of my winter hat.", "summary": "Unbeatable for the price.", "unixReviewTime": 1423958400}

This is made up of a very light weight wool-like type of material.

I would only recommend it if you are just leaving directly from your house, to your car, to quickly run in and out of a vehicle, building, etc.  Also, the size doesn't really fit right either.  I think that you really have to be a small framed or light weight person in order for this coat to fit you properly.  I wear a Women's Size 12 and I ordered an XL hoping that it would give me more room but it fits me like a size Medium.  I just decided to give it to my grandaughter to wear to church instead.

Maybe the latter will get easier with time and more usage, but for now, I have to take my thumb out the glove to undo the mitt off the button.

We loved the design of this wookie robe, and thought the character matched his own as he is a very tall 7 year-old and likes Star Wars.  It fit just a little more snug than I expected, particularly around his head, but then I had to guess on the sizing.  (More on sizing below.)  But once he tried it on I could not get him to take it off, so we kept it.  It is super soft and comfortable.  It is made of polyester, so its not very absorbent, but it is plush enough that it does absorb a tiny bit.  Previous robes we've had allowed him to just wrap himself in the robe straight out of the bath without a towel.  With this robe we use a towel to dry off first, then put on the robe.  Likewise this will not double as an absorbant cover-up out of the pool.  But it is perfect for before bed or early morning cover up.  It has one large pocket on the right side hip which you can see if you zoom in on the picture.  The design of the bandolier aligns neatly with the belt when tied. The hoodie fits his head for now, but it may get tight on his head before he outgrows the rest of the robe. Overall we love it. If it was a little cheaper we might have thought about getting the Bobba Fett robe for his younger brother.  But for what it is, Star Wars merchandise and good quality of product, we are very satisfied.\n\nSizing - I am assuming that \"Groovy UK\" is not an American company, which explains the confusion in sizing.  The robe took 2 weeks to arrive and was shipped in very different packaging than most parcel mail, definitely not shipped from Amazon, but it still arrived ahead of estimated delivery date so we were happy.\nThe sizing guide is the \"Amazon Kids and Baby Size Chart\".  It breaks down sizes for Little Boys and Big Boys.  Unfortunately, it does not say whether the seller, \"Groovy UK\", matches with the Little Boys or the Big Boys sizes. (Or Little/Big Girls for that matter).  Our son's height put him at either a Little Boys large  \"L(6)\" or a Big Boys small \"S(8)\".  Our son right now is a 7/8.  The seller only offers sizes medium and large on Amazon, (on the clothing label it just says \"kid medium\").  I gambled that the sizing would be for Big Boys and ordered the medium, thinking we would get the \"M(10-12)\".  I thought if it turned out to be too small, then they had used the Little Boys sizing, which would have given us the \"M(5)\", and we'd send it back for an exchange.  When we got the robe, it fit him comfortably.  It fits him like a size 7, and he is a size 7/8, but that doesn't match up with either of Amazon's sizes of \"M\".  The only thing I can figure is that the seller's sizes run smaller than Amazon's.  So for \"Groovy UK\" a medium is not Amazon's \"M(10-12)\" but more like an 8.  Bottom line, use the Big Kid sizing and order a size up.", "summary": "Soft & Comfy, Looks Cool, but order a size up", "unixReviewTime": 1404864000}

I've seen the actual charms in the stores and the reason why I chose to purchase from the seller because they seem to offer a lower price compared to retail price. Well, apparently there's a catch to cheaper prices! The charms DO NOT come in original Pandora boxes, just cheap paper box and all charms thrown into one bag.

Bought it a month ago.\n\nDesign: watch face looks much lighter then I expected. From the pictures it feels that it should be very dark but in reality the top half of the face is very light gray, and the bottom is darker but still much lighter than expected.\n\nQuality: the watch feels very light and fragile. Strap came off, detached from the watch 3 times during the last month, caused by me tightening it too much (wasn't super tight though, it was still wearable with no discomfort at that point). Easy to reattach the strap by hand but doesn't add to the quality feel of the product.\n\nTime keeping: it's very hard to set it more or less precisely. I have to set it up to ~20 min ahead of time for the watch to pick up the correct time. I.e. if it's 2pm then I have to set it to roughly 2.20pm, then it kinda sits there until 2.20pm and then starts showing correct time. And it's hard to figure out the exact offset value.\n\nDate display: the manual says that it comes pre-set for the date to roll-over at midnight. This wasn't my case, it was setup to roll over some time in the afternoon. It's easy to set it correctly but I expected it to work out of the box.\n\nOverall: it's a fine watch overall. I still like to wear it, still looks not bad, and it still shows the time. The time and date setup are documented in the manual so it's not a big deal. But for the price and \"german-made\" tag I expected more refined product. There are other makes which offer models which feel noticeably better in the same price range.", "summary": "It's a nice watch but did not fully meet my expectations", "unixReviewTime": 1451952000}

Despite having less resolution than a typical watch, it's much easier to read once you get used to it and really gives you all the information you actually need. I've only found two downsides to the concept. The first is its usefulness in cooking. Hard to sear a steak for 3 minutes on each side when you can only discern 10 minute increments. The second is that it's pretty difficult to get it set (or even tell it's working) without just waiting for some time to pass. It took me about three days of fiddling with the time before I no longer needed to fine-tune the time on it.\n\nThe watch itself is pretty nice. The case is nicely machined and nothing seems loose in the timepiece. VERY light weight. The crown rotates smoothly although there is some hysteresis in its effect. That is, when you change direction of the crown, the hand doesn't reverse direction until it's moved an additional 5-10 minutes (this was a major contributor in my trouble getting it set right). The band, however, could be better. While it looks nice and understated, the material feels cheap and the pins \"tick\" when the band flexes leading me to believe the pins either don't fit snuggly or will break fairly soon.\n\nOverall, I'm still pretty happy with the watch. Looks nice. Works well. Comfortable.\n\nUPDATE: I had to reduce my rating because this watch is pretty bad at keeping time. It seems to oscillate back and forth around the actual time. As an example, it may be correct at 9:30, but at 11:30 it will read 11: 40 and later at 14:30 it will read 14:20, but by 18:30 it will be reading correct again. The times are just examples though because it doesn't consistently get ahead or behind at predictable intervals. For the first couple of weeks, I had kinda gotten OK with this because if you just leave it alone, it will stay mostly correct. But yesterday, it inexplicable fell behind by about 20 minutes and stayed that way. After resetting it to the correct time, it has been back to \"normal\" so it doesn't appear to have started running slow (i.e. not a dying battery I don't think).\n\nIn general, this thing is just horribly unreliable. So if you want a watch that looks nice, but that you don't intend to take too seriously then this one will work for you. But if you need to be able to trust the time your watch is telling you, you could spend a tenth of the price and get better results.", "summary": "Good looking, but bad at keeping time", "unixReviewTime": 1521590400}

Which I know could be really expensive for non-watch collector like me. However, there are a few points here that made me consider on buying this watch. Here's a few things I like about the watch :\n\n1) The 24 hours concept : The one and only hand revolves around the watch only once a day. For me it gives me some sort of relaxation on my sense of time. What I mean is that we all are so busy with our lives that somehow we forgot to take things slowly and look at the small things. When I go through my day, this watch kinda tell me to relax and not to rush in doing anything. For me its something that other watch do not have\n\n2) Sappire crystal glass : Extremely durable and scratch resistance. I knocked this watch once at a door knob no sign of scratch found\n\n3) Dress friendly watch : I own several watches and some of them are big and thick. Big and thick watch does not fit under my sleeve. This watch is extremely thin and fit under my sleeve perfectly.\n\n4) Elegant looking : Might sound cliche but this watch is one of a kind. I like the black and green combination more than the white and orange due to sleek and minimal looking.\n\n5) Have a DATE window : I do not buy watch without a date window. Date window is life and it is extremely important!\n\n6) Accurate : This watch use an excellent quartz movement that keep times. I own it more than 3 months now and it does not show any time error for now\n\nHowever, there are a few things that I think can be better :\n\n1) 3 atm water resistance : Are you serious? For me 3 ATM watch means no water contact watch at all. They say it can withstand light rain and hand wash. I just do not want to take the risk on my $400 watch. Although it is pretty common for a dress watch to have 3ATM water resistance, I would love to this watch to get 5ATM water resistance, at least.\n\n2) Readability : Actually I am okay with the watch readability. But I am writing this to warn folks out there, especially the old ones. It is not that this watch is impossible to read, it just somehow the numbers are a bit small and folks with glass might have a problem reading it. But not me, both my eyes are 10/10\n\n3)", "summary": "I will say what I like and what I do not like about this watch ...", "unixReviewTime": 1454371200}

I wasn't sure what to make of it, so I photographed it and sent it to the support email.  It was early in the day California time, but late in the day in Germany.  I received a response, directly from the product manager within 30 minutes, who explained that the watches go through multiple levels of quality checks, and occasionally are pulled and inspected to ensure water tightness.  He said that the mark on the side of my case (and it's really tiny) was probably an indication of a watch that had been double checked and the gasket replaced.  He agreed that it was not standard to have a watch go to a consumer with any mar whatsoever.  If I wanted to return it, that would have been fine.  I wore the watch for several days and the tiny nick was just never visible.  I did however get several compliments on the watch right away.  I decided over the course of the week that the nick didn't really matter, and I was encouraged by the quick and proactive response that if I did have a real issue with the watch over time, it would be addressed.  I've kept the watch and happy I did.  I enjoy the whole day view it gives me and find that it's a perfect example of a case where analog trumps digital, as it provides so much more information and context than a digital readout ever could.  This is an awesome watch from a company that cares about its customers. I've attached a photo so you can see what I was talking about.

But I was wrong!  I have bought five necklaces and about seven pair of earrings.  They are great fun - very stylish and do not look like inexpensive pieces.  For the price, how wrong can you go?  On this necklace, one of the decorative pieces on the side of the chain came undone from the necklace, so I got a tweezer, put it back on and secured it tightly.  No big deal at all!

They are very unique and a very specific style that I spent several weeks looking for. I can say that I am very glad that I found these because they are pretty much exactly what I was looking for.\n\nAs for the quality, I have owned several pairs of Demonia boots and I have worn every one of them until there was nothing left to wear. I literally walked out the front of one pair and out the back of another, not because of build quality but because I spent 2 or 3 years wearing each pair until they just fell apart.\nAs far as these boots go, the quality is just what I expected from Demonia. They walk well and after the first few days of getting used to them I find them very comfortable. My only real complaint is the \"man-made leather\" that Demonia loves to use on any of their boots that cost under $200. If these were real leather I'd have no complaints at all. An option for plain, non-skull buckles would have been nice too but since they are covered by my pants I can live with them.\n\nSo basicly if you are looking for some unique brogue style shoes but prefer boots like me, these are great and you really can't beat the price either.", "summary": "Very unique and surprisingly comfortable.", "unixReviewTime": 1295049600}

I don't want to have to excuse myself to a restroom or do the shirt tuck dance every time I stand up from a seated position, nor do I want to remain standing at all times just to have my shirt look nice.\" Then my friend told me of what he called shirt stays (which is what I'm going to call them for this review because \"Holdup ShirtTail Tightning Straps called Stay Downs in Y-style with Composite Plastic Gripper Clasps\" is too wordy), and described this product. I eventually placed my order.\n\nThe package came unceremoniously in a plastic bag packaging, complete with a suspenders catalogue for all your suspender needs. Nothing wrong with this, it just made me chuckle. I observed the unique clamps which I hadn't expected to work the way they did. Again, not a bad thing, just not what I expected. And the stretchy material used to put it all together. I noticed near the sock-end of the contraption what I thought was velcro, but upon an attempted tug thought it must be sewn.\n\nThe following morning, I get dressed. Starting like I normally would, I put on my underwear first. Followed by my socks, then undershirt. I put on my dress shirt, button it up, and decide this is the moment to dawn my new shirt stays. Letting gravity work with me, I attach them to the bottom of my shirt first, and immediately realize they're too long. The bottom clasps are hanging well below the tops of my socks. I'm a bit smaller than average (5'7\" tall with a 30 inch inseam), but these are hanging inches too low. I look carefully at the package again along with the shirt stays and realize the velcro I noticed from the day before is NOT sewn down, and pull hard enough I thought something might break. I \"adjust\" them to the smallest setting, and manage to connect them to my socks without having them snap back and break out my teeth. Proud of my work, I stand tall, feeling the slight tug from my socks to the tops of my shoulders (without pants yet), and decide these things are great! I put on my pants, and shoes and realize that anyone who decides to take a peek is clearly going to see odd bulges and bumps where the clasps are under the pants. I push the voice inside my head to the side, insisting that the voice is being paranoid and go to work.\n\nThe strap along the sides of my legs becomes less noticeable in short order, but the clasps are harder to ignore. After a few hours of work, and a few cups of coffee it is time to use the restroom, and that's when it hits the fan.\n\nI step into the stall to take my morning deuce, and pull at the bottom of my shirt to untuck it from my pants like I always do, and it isn't moving. \"Of course it isn't because it's attached to your socks numb-nuts.\" I think to myself. \"So what? Maybe not everyone untucks their shirts first, just pull down your pants.\" This is when it all begins to occur to me what nightmare I just woke up in. I can't pull down my underwear with my pants because my shirt is still tucked in. So I try to pull down just my pants and bend back my thumbnail that gets caught on the darn clasp. Once again, I try to pull up my shirt in order to get to the top of my underwear, but it still isn't budging because like before, it is attached to my socks. I contort my wrists to pull down my underwear by the leg holes, and start to assume the position, only to realize the shirt stays are pulling the bottom of my shirt to cover my hiney, and if I'm not super mindful of this, I'm going to poo on my shirt tail.\n\nI manage to.... ahem.... clear the area, do what I need to do and take care of my business. Afterwards, glad to still have a clean shirt, I stand up off the toilet, grab my underwear and pants to pull them up, together, in one motion, as I have done for over 30 years, only to get them to the tops of my thighs before I am once again encumbered by the bottom of my shirt, which is still attached to my socks by the shirt stays. I let go, and my belt buckle pulls my pants back to the ground with a loud clank, leaving my underwear at the top of my thighs, and my hands empty as I can't believe I have to give this much thought on how to get re-dressed. I bend over at the waist, attempting to bring my elbows to my knees in order to get my hands a better angle to grab the top of my underwear and try to drag it up into position. Once the underwear was back into position, pulling up the pants was easy, and the shirt stays meant I didn't have to put for any effort whatsoever to tuck my shirt in.\n\nHowever, by the third go round of this in the day (fortunately, I'm very regular), the clasps decided they simply couldn't take it anymore, and came undone as I pulled up my pants (or down, I can't even remember now), and just didn't have the staying power it started with in the morning.\n\nDo they do what they're supposed to do? Yes. And really, that's important, maybe the most important. It isn't that these are bad quality, or don't work, because the fact is they do work. However, are they practical? Not really, especially for people who wear underwear, and use the bathroom. They would be far less cumbersome if you're going commando. They also wouldn't be so bad if you were only going to wear them over a short enough period of time that you wouldn't be going to use a toilet in that time frame. But trying to wear them all day, with underwear, and multiple trips to the toilet is asking a lot. And if you have some kind of GI problem such as Crohn's disease, or IBS, then you're playing with fire.\n\nI'm never wearing them again. And I couldn't recommend them to anyone without telling them this story so they aren't blindsided in a restroom, having to think through a situation that should just be second nature.", "summary": "Useful if you don't wear underwear or use the bathroom.", "unixReviewTime": 1523404800}

I fancy myself as an audiophile. I have a large 45rpm collection.  I thought this stabilizer/weight would be just what I was looking for. I have issues with warped records, more so with vinyl records.  This seems to be a much less problem withs styrene. I would like to elliminate as much of the \"warp wobble\" as possible when playing a record. The sabilizier does a very nice job of this.  Even records with larger warps, it can still help eliminate much of it. I have posted a video of a 45 with a slight/medium warp. The stabilizer also helps with records that are bowed in the center, where the center is much higher than the outer edge of the record. This causes an angle/slant to the record that would effect play.  Once you place the stabilizer on the record, it would flatten the record, or as near to flat as it can get. Even if the record was bowed the other way, it would still flatten the outer edge of the record even if it was only slight.  I really like the stabilizer and it does a great job. I thought by the description it would not be heavy enough but now that I have it I can tell you it is plenty heavy enough to do the job is was designed for,  I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I thought it was kinda pricey. But, I would recommend this to anyway.", "summary": "Excellent product.  Works as it should.  Any serious collector should have one!", "unixReviewTime": 1466467200}

I can fix it, but it's very noticeable after brushing it.\n2. Like one of the other reviewers said, the ponytail was a bit messy. I'm sure with some time, patience, and wig styling, it'll look better. It also could be from the packaging.\n3. It was tighter than I liked it to be.

Now that it's been dry cleaned, it doesn't smell anymore, which is nice because I don't think I could have worn  it otherwise.\n\nSide note: the fur is actually real fur.

I looked on the page and saw a couple of negative reviews that it was falling apart so I figured I'd leave my feedback:\n\nI am NOT NICE to my things. I'm terrible. My purse has like 500 things in it - umbrella, deodorant, hairbrush, wallet, checkbook, hat and gloves, etc. etc. you get the point. And it's not necessarily a \"large\" purse, pretty medium sized. And I shove things into it that shouldn't fit all the time, like a pair of heels to change into, on top of everything else already in there. So I was surprised to see people saying their case was falling apart! Because it survives being one of my 24/7 purse items, crammed around with everything else. I even brought this case backpacking through Norway and it survived! I mean maybe the other ones were just defects? But I use this often, and I shove it into terrible places and shove things on top of it, and my raybans have yet to break (*knock on wood*). I bring it almost daily to Central park in a beach bag as well, so lots of opening and closing and good usage! It actually looks and functions like it was still brand new.\n\nFor reference they fit aviators but I do not think they would fit the wayfarers. I haven't tried though, I gave my wayfarers to my sister because they are too big for my face.", "summary": "Durable, for me at least!", "unixReviewTime": 1481068800}
