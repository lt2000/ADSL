Gallardo", "reviewText": "This ring feels nice most of the time. I was really disappointed by the lack of half sizes. I require a 7.5, but I had to buy an 8, which means the ring fits me loose. In normal circumstances this isn't a big deal, but when I am washing my hands, or taking a shower, the ring gets really slick, and I have had it come off a few times.\n\nThe ceramic portion of this ring is fantastic. It looks beautiful, and it extremely well-polished. I have gotten compliments from strangers on the beauty of it. However, since it is so well-polished in the inside, it does have a tendency to be sort of sticky. It's a bit difficult to explain, but if a very small amount of perspiration gets between the band and the skin, it's almost like a suction or vacuum which causes the ring to pull on the skin. It isn't painful or anything, just a bit uncomfortable, and is cause for constant adjustment, which then becomes an annoyance. This may also be due to the fact that it is a little too big for my finger.\n\nThe carbon fiber portion was unbelievably beautiful in the beginning. The criss-cross pattern of the fibers reflects light beautifully. The resin is completely transparent, and polished to high gloss, and so smooth and level with the ceramic that it is difficult to distinguish where it ends. There is very good craftsmanship in that. The problem is that it is resin, and so after a few months the scratches begin to build up, and the resin is no longer transparent. I have had this ring for three months, and it still looks good from a distance, but the resin is starting to take on a translucent quality from the scratched surface. Eventually the carbon fiber strands will be hidden behind the scratches, and will need to be polished.\n\nWith all of that said, this ring is still very much worth the money. After all, it is very inexpensive, and you can afford to buy a few of them now, to replace the ugly ones in the future.\n\nI haven't experienced any chipping, cracking, or breaking, and the ceramic is extraordinarily difficult to scratch.", "summary": "Very Good Quality, But Buy a Few", "unixReviewTime": 1422144000}

Based on the first measurements its perfect (on me) as a waist belt, especially for Ren costumes. It's doubtful this could be used as a hip belt or put through the belt loops of pants.\n\nIt looks prettier in person as well with a chain mail style with textured loops running along the center and plainer silver polished chain running along the sides. It has nice weight to it and does not feel as if it will fall apart any time soon. The lobster claw clasp is also big enough to easily fasten and feels secure.

Especially on a little black dress. It's the perfect belt/accessory that doesn't stand out too much so it doesn't take away from the dress but really accentuates your curves and adds a nice touch to your outfit. I tried it with jeans but it looks much better with a dark colors dress.\nI really like how there are three rows of rhinestones because its not too much flashiness but it is also not too little that people would not notice it.\nI wore it out for a dinner with my husband and friends and it stayed on pretty well. I was a little skeptical that it would stay together because it seems very fragile. Even though there is three row of rhinestones it is still a very thin belt so I would be careful with it. I would really like to wear it to the club but I am afraid that it might fall apart or someone might accidentally get caught in it while dancing. Also, people could accidentally pull on it and I do not think it is strong enough to keep together from something like that.\nThe reason I can only give it four stars is that even after one use, one of the rhinestones fell out. Honestly, I am not 100% sure whether the rhinestone was already missing or if it fell out during my dinner out with my husband and friends. We really just went out and had a nice dinner so we did not do anything that would make it fall out so I am thinking maybe it was already missing from the beginning.\nI would totally order this belt as it is a really nice addition to an outfit but my advice would be to check the belt as soon as you receive it to make sure all the rhinestones are there.\nI received this item at a discount in exchange for my unbiased and honest review.

I wear a ladies size 4 jeans and I was easily able to wear this on my hips and waist. The gold color on this is more of a rose gold color then yellow gold. The rhinestones were all intact. The reason I rated this a four is that while wearing it it looked nice but catches on everything you grace/ The rhinestones are on there with larger prong settings and they do not look like they will hold up to well. The closure itself is well made and easy to use. Its a simple larger hook shape clasps. I would say its worth it to buy and wear it a few times. But not if you plan on wearing something like a light shawl over your outfit that might drape over the belt. But it does look nice I think I would of preferred it in silver then the rose gold to match easier.

If there is a product that I find is not 5 stars I will always contact the seller first to see if the issue can be resolved, and will note this. I've been really fortunate I have only had a few handfuls of products to date that have been not turned out great. I will also like to note I generally am allowed to choose what I pick to product test so more often then not these are products I'm looking forward to testing or already thinking of purchasing. Therefore less likely to be disappointed. That being said if you check my reviews I have not been shy to rate any product less then 5 including the lowest rating if it is warranted.

From the make I can tell this isn't meant for long time/long lasting wearing. From what I can tell it is two layers of fabric with and yes it is, steel bones but braided. The front busk is just plain steel. The fabric is a cotton polyester blend with no canvas or trill middle or lining which a true corset has. The cotton poly blend substitutes but isn't nearly as strong or long lasting. The bones are very flexible but when you have it on and laced you can't bend it nearly as well. You actually have to put in effort.\nI've worn it three days as a part of seasoning\nDay one loose for two hours\nDay two tighter but still loose for two or threehours a break and another 4 (not recommended)\nDay three (today) just put it on.\nIt has formed to my body VERY well and?pretty fast. When I first wore it it was very stiff and a little uncomfortable and I honestly thought I had bought the wrong size because I had loosened it a great deal(about a four inch gap). but day two it had felt more relaxed against my body and I didn't have as many issues with tightening it in the back. I tightened about two more inches in from the day before(btw I replaced the ribbon with heavy duty lacing). So far I have had no issues with fraying, bones poking out, seams coming loose etc... it's held up pretty well. When I laced it up this morning I was actually able to lace it were the middle was only an half inch apart; the top and bottom gap at my hips and ribs are about an inch and half or so.\nSo far so good. Anyone wondering my measurements I wear a US L. 14 pant. 36DD. I bought a xL3. I'm 5'5\" 170lbs. This corset has no selioet. Its just straight with curves at the top and bottom for you hips and ribs which is why I gave 4stars.

The paper they use is sturdy, but stiff and feels like thick construction paper. Also, the tape they use to hold this origami masterpiece together grabs any tiny hairs that are present. I would suggest a full waxing if you want to use these long term.\nUsefulness - This is where it really earns 5 stars. Since underwear is the only clothing that really needs to be washed, I have been able to sell my washer and dryer; saving hundreds on my water bill. When you are done using a pair, you don't have to throw them out either. They can easily be up-cycled and given to the kids to color on and make paper airplanes, used as a coffee filter the next morning, staple the leg holes and it makes a nice lunch sack, the possibilities are endless! Lifehack! I found them useful while in the office also.

One cross country meet where I used and recalled 8 split times and seven youth soccer games went by without incident.

One balance it's a no way.\n\nYou can take a chance like I did, and if you do I hope you get a good one.\nOn the other hand there are enough negatives for that to be a big risk.\nFor the functions and price point it's a great concept. In practice it's almost certainly not going to work for you.\n\n**UPDATE**\nNow about an hour or two after getting it to check before writing the review it has started beeping randomly.

Its why I got it in the first place. Might be little too big for ones liking as it was for mine but its not overly large. I was also worried that its shape, might puncture or sting mainly when asleep, that is not the case. Its perfectly dull and when wearing, it always touches your body sideways, only bending makes it being pointy, but once it lands back, it goes right on its side, not once have I had it pressed in. Now regards its effects, it seems to do something as I no longer feel as stressed as before. Its not a mind thing, rather, I would call it a soul experience. No headaches either, however, that might also be in combination of a shungite pyramid that came the same day. However, out of home, this pendant, and the other one i'm reviewing. Worn by two individuals, same outcome. The change is there nearly immediately and in a positive light. I would recommend it to everyone, even if it wouldn't work (which it does) its still an interesting pendant.

She had mentioned she really wanted to get some chunky jewelry to amp up her look for shows etc.  When I saw this bracelet, I immediately thought of her and what she was looking to do with her style.  It comes with an adorable bag that has a draw string.  It was not in the bag when it arrived the bag was seperate but I really liked that because it is going to allow me to put some of the extra confetti like stuff in the bag with it to give to my daughter as a gift.  There are very specific cleaning and care instructions on the listing for this item.  I highly recommend you use them if you purchase this bracelet.  I did notice that someone had posted previously that they had an issue with the color running.  I think that is probably why the instructions are listed.  In case you can not find them they are below:\nTips to Maintain your accessories:\n1) Avoid direct contact with heat, or expose under the sun.\n2) Before showering, take out the accessories and keep it in a safe place.\n3) Avoid solvents or chemicals like perfume or soap. Dry it with a clean towel if gets wet.\n4) Clean in a secure location, not the rim of a sink where a piece may slip down the drain.\n5) Use only a soft brush, never sharp or hard objects, to remove dirt or particles.\n\nKeep in mind items that you may use like perfume etc may have alcohol or other agents in it to 'scent' the perfume and may create issues with any jewelry you put on.  I try to make sure my perfume has had time to dry before putting anything on where I have applied it.\n\nOverall the bracelet is gorgeous.  It is also very sturdy and I am very happy with my purchase as well as the superfast shipping speed!\n\nI did recieve a discount on this product in exchange for an honest review, however, as I am typing this, I do notice the pricing I paid is the same as the sale price listed for the public.

I was nervous about many things with this watch, especially buying overseas, but they were all placated once I received the watch.  It came in a simple box with a pillow, but no instructions.\n - The crown is a screw-in kind, but the second hand does not stop when you pull out the crown all the way to set the time.\n - It keeps time pretty accurately, haven't measured it exactly to the minute though, but it hasn't really gone too far ahead or behind in the 4 days I've owned it.\n - It doesn't look too big on the wrist, in fact it looks really good.  The case height is relatively high but I can fit it underneath my shirt cuff just fine\n - The strap is nice and the clasp is just okay - it's kind of awkward to set up, but it is nice to have a clasp.\n - The bezel rotates counter-clockwise.  I have seen a few videos where the bezel has been messed up in one way or another with a Parnis, so I was nervous mine might not align perfectly at the 12oclock position or it would be too loose, but it ratchets quite nicely, and lines up perfectly.\n - The movement is a 21 jewel Miyota movement (which I assume they mean Citizen?), and it works fine - I estimate 4-5 ticks per second, so it isn't the smoothest in the world, but it also definitely gives the effect of a smooth ticker just fine.\n - The weight to wind the spring is a bit loud - not louder than the vents in my office, but in a quiet room you can hear it for sure.  I can't hear it when it's in the watch winder though.\n - The crystal is sapphire, which is very nice\n\nThe seller was great to me as a customer with my myriad questions and it arrived in 12 days from China.

I recommend this for men, not ladies, only because the pendant is heavy, but I highly recommend it for anyone that plays the GTA series of games because you get to throw hand grenades & you get stars when the police are chasing you lol.\nI also recommend it for anyone that is or was in the Army because I did a search for Army symbols & Army jewelry & this is the only one that I liked.\nIt arrived in a small zip baggie with the pendant beside, not on the chain, inside a square bubble lined white envelope approximately 6\" x 6\".

(Wish the skirt was shown on a model.) However, even if you let it ride low on the hips, the black underlining only comes to the top of the knee at best. The description says the skirt is 57 cm long for a large, but I measured it at barely 53 cm.\n\nI am 5'3\", 107 lbs., and I typically wear a US small, but given that these are Asian sizes, I ordered a large to be on the safe side, and because I wanted to make sure it was long enough.  I can always do some slight alterations if it is too big but not if it's too small. With that being said, I should have ordered a small. The waist band has a lot of elastic in it and is meant to be stretched to fit. However, mine doesn't stretch at all because it is so big on me. This causes the waist band to bunch up around the sides and sticks out under a shirt. Will probably return or give away.", "summary": "Not quite like the picture", "unixReviewTime": 1412035200}

If you have wider hips/a more hourglass figure, you will want to size up even more than I did, or expect to wear it more bunched up at your waist.\n\nThe fabric is pretty soft, but it's a sheer mesh (except for the collar and the trim on the sleeves, which are opaque).

Very comfortable and has easy on and off clasp.\n\nIt is a good looking watch for anyone that likes both analog and digital functions in one.  The watch is much lighter than it looks.  There is a piece of orange plastic just under the bezel that cheapens the look a bit.  The bezel edge is raised slightly which protects the crystal.\n\nThe accuracy is incredible for such an inexpensive watch.  In 12 days neither the analog or digital portions of the watch have lost even one second.  In comparison, I have an inexpensive Walmart watch which, in the same amount of time, has lost 7 seconds on the analog and gained 7 seconds on the digital portion.

The fit would be too small if I had bought any smaller. I like how the neckline and underarm area doesn't drop too low, so it's easy to wear a strapless bra with it and not worry about it showing. Really, the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars out of 5 is because I had to trim some of the lining on the inside of it (hard to explain, but on the inside of the tank top, in between the lining and the outer shell there is a stitch line that connects the black \"v\" top to the white and you could see too much of the black material through the sheer white part. Anyway, it took about 15 minutes to trim away the excess black material so it wouldn't show through on the outside. I apologize if that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but basically now that I finished it, it's definitely wearable and my cutting won't fray because I trimmed outside of the actual stitch they had. In the end, it's probably on the caliber of forever 21 (not well made) but when I put it on, somehow it still can pull off the fancy look and because of its unique style, I felt like it was worth it in the end. It's an adorable top, I'm looking forward to wearing it on a date night with pretty earrings and a bracelet", "summary": "size C-D bra) and I bought a large and am happy I did", "unixReviewTime": 1437350400}

I wouldn't recommend washing it in a washing machine or drying it in a dryer. It is not a terrible purchase overall, but I wouldn't buy it as a gift, those edges make it look even cheaper than it is.", "summary": "Badly finished edges.", "unixReviewTime": 1438214400}

The purse is probably worth $35 and the fact it has Marilyn Monroe on it is all the more reason to spend a mere $10 more.\n\nNote: Try to view the wallet as just an \"extra\" for buying the purse.

Sure it is on the last hole, the leather of the band has a fair bit of give in it and with regular use will be as comfy as my fave pair of shoes.  This was really does offer a lot of bang for the buck.  It comes with a small plastic clip on the inside of the winder, I figured I would have to wind it regularly, yet I haven't. Once I removed the clip it started ticking away, it was easy to set the time.  The only note of interest really is that the band covers the back of the watch, so changing a battery might present a challange without  resorting to cutting the band out there.

The only thing I would say is that I have NO idea how to keep \"the girls\" up in this dress. The V neck is very deep and the back goes down pretty low.  There are pads to hide any slippage, but there really isn't a lot by way of support.  If you had a D cup.. I honestly think you'd runneth over pretty substantially!  The fabric is more of a thin swimsuit type of material, so I'm not even sure I could get away with wearing it on a hot day as a swimsuit cover up.  I want to keep it though.  I know that there are support systems out there for backless dresses, and this dress is just too figure flattering not to find a way to make it work.  One thing to note is that I originally purchased this dress for the pale blue empire waist band, but the pattern differs from the picture.  As a result I got a dark grey band instead of a blue one.  The blue is also a little darker than the picture shows.  Again, the dress looks so good on that this wasn't a deal breaker.

I am living in these this summer and enjoying every moment! They are cool and comfy and with the bra shelf I don't need a bra with them at all. The colors are bright, vivid and vibrant and go well with shorts, jeans or even PJ's at night. They are also tagless which is a HUGE plus in my book. These tops are soft and wonderful. They wash up well and I throw them directly in the dryer where they come out wrinkle free and vibrant colored every time. I have worn and washed these a lot and the colors are still true which is very nice\n\nWith all that being said, I must say that they do run small. I am a very small person (under 100 lbs) and I ordered the small size. I can honestly say that anyone even a tiny bit larger boned or slightly larger breasted would likely have a hard time fitting into them. With this in mind you may want to purchase a size up than your normal size as they will run a bit tight. The lighter colors can be a little revealing so I only wear them around the house (I live with my hubby, no kids at home). However, the darker colors work well for wearing out and about with no worries.\n\nI would highly recommend these little tanks for casual wear especially given the advice I gave above. They will also be perfect for layering in the cooler months. I really like them and plan to order more!\n\nI hope this review helps you! :) I try to be objective, detailed and always completely honest with my reviews.

I know how they are supposed to fit (tightly) and how it can be a struggle to get them on.  Having said that, this brand SUCKS.  Do NOT buy anything in the Preggers brand.\n\nI am pregnant now, and wanted some form of compression leggings/knee highs/etc to wear to work, as I am a pharmacist and on my feet pretty much all day.  I ordered 2 pairs of the Preggers Maternity Footless Tights 10-15mmHG and a pair of the 20-30mmHG compression knee highs.  I tried to wear the knee highs, and even though I carefully measured my ankles and calves and ordered a whole size larger than the chart recommended... THEY. WERE. TIGHT.  They were so tight, they were very uncomfortable, so I had to take them off immediately.  Understand that I was used to wearing thigh high compression stockings at 20-30mmHg all day, for at least 12 hours... never bothered me one bit, and they almost felt nice -- NOT THESE.\n\nThe next day I tried on the Footless Tights in the 10-15mmHg, thinking that they would be a little more forgiving, since the compression was half that of the knee highs... nope.  THEY WERE HORRIBLE.  Not only was I unable to advance the tights past my knee, I wouldn't have worn them anyway since they were completely see through and almost cut off  my circulation due to them twisting so easily.  At the point I was able to get them to the bend at my knee, I'd had enough.  I took both pairs (tights and knee highs) to my OB apt that week and asked him about them.  Was it possible that I was totally out of \"compression stocking practice\"??  He had me show him how I was \"trying to put them on\" and immediately told me to return them and get another brand.  He said they were clearly not sized properly and potentially dangerous as is, due to the risk of twisting and over compression.  Again, he recommended Sigvaris brand.\n\nLadies... please take my word when I say to spend a little more and purchase a true medical grade compression stocking/knee high/thigh high.

Unless the product has changed since I purchased it in mid-2016, I can't imagine how a tall person could wear this.  The chiffon is see-through.  There is an underlayer that keeps the dress itself from being see-through, but it only came down to about mid-thigh on me, so anything below that will be visible.  The tie around the neck and the volume will easily allow this to fit a variety of sizes (I'm about 135 pounds).  My only issue when I bought this dress was that the seller did not include the belt that was advertised (which was supposed to be chiffon in the same color).  Instead I got the belt pictured -- a bizarre faux-leather flower thing that didn't match the dress at all.  I asked for a replacement and they gave me a partial refund instead, which was a little annoying because then I had to buy another belt (you could definitely wear this without a belt, but it's a totally different, kind of '70s, vibe).

I purchased several of these necklaces on Amazon as stocking stuffers (for this price they simply cannot be beat!). A couple of things to note, it looks significantly more expensive than the ~$8 i paid for it, if i saw this exact same necklace in a boutique in the US, my best bet it would be between $25-$30. The necklace comes in those ugly long plastic bags which makes it seem cheaper but i took it out and put in a little jewelry box with some ribbon and it instantly became a chic present i'd be willing to give any of my trendy girlfriends. The picture makes the necklace look more turquoise than green (as the description states) but when it definitely looks more like a light lime green in person (think key lime pie green). Still very pretty but that was the main reason i took off 1 star. it just wasn't what i was expecting from the photo. the stones are textured (rather than smooth) which makes them look like a nicer quality. This particular one i gave away as a gift but kept several from this same store for myself because they were so beautiful.

I returned this pair and left packaging feedback mentioning that padded envelopes for sunglasses without hard cases was a bad idea and that small boxes would be a safer option. The return and shipment of the second pair was handled quickly and professionally.\n\nThe second pair I ordered came in a box with those air cushions and arrived in perfect condition. You may have to (very) gently adjust the nose pads to get them comfortable for your own face but that takes seconds to do.

The Embroidery for the three patched was somewhat sloppy, but a needle will fix that. The Jiy no Tsubasa on the back was printed on the material. However, the print looks very nice in my opinion. The color is perfect! The material also has a lining, but the material is not that thick so you won't be baking alive. The material is great and is very breathable. The buttons or mine actually snapped down, but I don't know if that's luck or anything. The patch also looks different from the picture. The rims are trimmed better. When you move your shoulders, it's a little tight.\n  The seller was also quick wight the shipping! Overall, this is about the best Attack on Titan jacket for the price. Hell, it's only $30! I recommend this for Attack on Titan cosplaying and/or for casual wearing.\n\nPros:\n Breathable lining and material-Easy to wear in crowded Conventions.\n The quality is spot-on\n Lining is very silky and comfortable\n\nCons:\n Sloppy needlework on the 3 patches.\n Tight shoulders\n Buttons are a bit bland-just a round gold button with nothing on it.", "summary": "Somewhat Sloppy Embroidery", "unixReviewTime": 1405987200}

I have no idea where their picture came from but it's nothing close to that.  Lace is cheap if you even want to be nice enough to call it lace. Trying to return the product has been horrible!  I sent it back May5th 2015, to China using the printing label supplied on the web site. As of today July 8th, 2015 no refund.  Even though I bought it under the prime so I felt it was a safe secure purchase. I wrote to the seller who said he would pay $80- $120 of the shipping cost, but once I shipped it, he then rejiggered on his offer.  Is that even legal?  The cost to ship this to China was ridiculous!  I highly advise you to steer very clear of this product!

I should have bought several (lol) but I was scared they wouldn't fit.... I waited almost a year to re-order these, but it was worth the wait. I can tell why they sell out in my size so fast!\n\nThese shirts really hug your curves and do so in all the right places. The v-neck shows just enough to be sexy and not too much so that you are still classy. The material feels really nice on your skin, light weight and not itchy at all. They aren't overly thin either. They have a nice feel that you can will last in the washer.\n\nI like to wear mine shirts when it's both cold and hot. During the winter I wear them with a nice open sweater or cardigan... Throwing a nice infinity scarf and you have an adorable outfit.

I enjoy shopping for jewelry - especially when I can get pieces for under $3. I got this necklace when it was only 99 cents. I've gotten other necklaces even cheaper. Still, those pieces got a much better rating than this did. I was extremely excited when I got it. Not as shiny as in the picture but it was still beautiful and did not look like something for less than a dollar. In fact, it could have easily passed for a necklace well over $20. And I know with cheap jewelry you MUST always put on a clear coat of nail polish (will post about that at the end of this review so please check it out if you buy cheap jewelry often!). Still, this necklace turned dark gold and then close to black in color VERY quickly. It happened where the chain touched the back of my neck. The chain became difficult to move. Very stiff.\n\nI have NEVER given a rating below 4 stars in the multiple years and dozens upon dozens of pieces of \"cheap\" jewelry I've gotten on Amazon. But this piece does not deserve a good rating. I highly DO NOT recommend this piece. The metal used is extremely cheap and poorly made. After just hours it looked like a piece of garbage. I'm not sure if I should throw it away or put it in a donation box for homeless people/the poor. I wonder if even they would want it in its current condition... Might as well give it a shot and give it to charity just in case.. If they don't want it they can throw it away. Hate to waste it completely.\n\n***** ADVICE ***** With ALL cheap jewelry you get you absolutely must put on a clear coat of nail polish (doesn't have to be expensive; I just use a 99cent bottle) so that the color doesn't fade - so it remains shiny. Also, the clear coat will make sure your skin doesn't turn green. Don't slop it on! You only need a small amount, a regular layer evenly distributed. Don't rush it either. Take your time. Do half the chain, hang it from a table, let it dry, do the other half, etc. I put a clear coat on my jewelry every 6 months to a year depending on how often its worn, if I went swimming with it on, been in the sun all day, etc. Those things make me put it on even more.", "summary": "Never given a rating this low before....", "unixReviewTime": 1449964800}

Secondly the brow of the visor should have an arc to it, not be straight across.  And the snout juts too far out at the bottom.  The movie props were vacuum-formed ABS plastic whilst this helmet is hand laid fibreglass.  Typically fibreglass helmets lack the crisp edges that the vacuum-formed helmets have.  Others point out that fibreglass helmets are heavier, but with a Biker Scout helmet the extra weight is negligible.  I like the fact that the seller has included a side-by-side photo comparison of their fibreglass helmet with the older out-of-production Don Post/Rubies plastic helmet.  You can see the obvious differences in the size of the helmet, the snout and the visor.  The Don Post helmet has been acknowledged by the 501st Legion community as being movie accurate.  The only knock with the Don Post helmet has been that the plastic was not ABS, but a softer blow-molded vinyl.  This made the helmet more likely to sag under high temperatures.  Buyers complained how the helmet kits were delivered with deformed parts.  If you're looking for even a reasonably accurate faithful reproduction Biker Scout helmet, do you're research.

Then, a day later, we received a phone call to verify all the measurements one more time.  Great customer service.

I love the colors, and while I'm not terribly impressed with the way the overlay and lace is cut, it's very pretty and I would have worn it had it fit. However, I'm not certain why I took the time to measure and then remeasure to make sure I was sending correct measurements, because the dress is at least two sizes too small. I would need to have four inches added almost everywhere to be able to zip it. I realize I'm not a size 4, but I followed other reviewers recommendations to order a larger dress. I contacted the seller when I realized there was no way I was going to be able to wear the dress, and we have gone around and around about my measurements and how I apparently didn't measure the same way. The seller went as far as telling me to be remeasured and provide photos of the measuring. Sorry, but I'm certainly not going to get down to next to nothing and take pictures to send to anyone, let alone someone I don't know! I've repeatedly asked for a return authorization and have yet to hear if this is going to happen. The seller wants to remake the dress and then if it still doesn't fit, she'll work with me. I'm disappointed that the dress doesn't fit, but I'm furious about the runaround. This dress was not inexpensive, and I responded quickly to every request from the seller, but am not getting great customer service.  ANYHOW, moral of the story, this dress runs VERY small - I sized up one size, followed the sellers sizing chart, measured and sent my measurements, and the dress was still way to small.

I have a large head for a female, and this hat was loose enough that I would not have wanted to wear it in a strong wind or bend over very far because it didn't feel secure.  HOWEVER, I would far rather have it run a bit large than be too snug.  The largeness can be remedied easly; snugness not so much.
