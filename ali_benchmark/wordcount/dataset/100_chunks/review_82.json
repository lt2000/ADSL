They come in an assortment of colors. I chose the pink. It has a nice clasp that I found a little challenging to unsnap. So if you have a problem with arthritis are such, you may find it a bit challenging.\nOnce in snapped, you will find two sections to your coins are like. The lining has a nicely designed cloth lining that's stitched together and attached to a silver plated attachment that is folds up very nicely to its per folded leather side lining.\n\nThe other fold over section of the wallet has this stylish silver decorative piece on the front that really seines the wallet. It gives it a sense of eloquence that blend perfectly with the leather. It opens up to a six section card holder with a area behind the card storage to discreetly tuck away bills or papers. Next it open up to another tri- compartment sectional area that also has a zipper area. Just tons and tons of storage.\nAdditionally there is another section on the inner side of the button snap. The button snap closes up the wallet into a nice clutch.\n\nThis is a very eye pleasing clutch/wallet that you will be delighted to pull out of your purse or to carry as a clutch by itself.  I received this product in exchange for my more than fair and honest review of it.", "summary": "Nicely designed leather wallet", "unixReviewTime": 1464825600}

So I ordered a 4T for my daughter who will be 2 in one week. Upon receipt of the suit, I found that it actually fits very true to size (so, much too large for my daughter). I have a son who is a 4T and it looks like the perfect size for him.\nThe swimming cap does fit my daughter perfectly now, so Id say those run quite small. It wouldnt come close to fitting my sons big head. But we probably won't really use the swimming cap. Its just a cute accessory to have.\nThe suit is well sewn (no loose threads, etc) and the material is great. Honestly, its much higher quality than I expected it to be. I love the design, with the cute cut out in the back. And the leopard print is adorable.\nI didn't notice before purchasing, however, that it is bedazzled on the front (you can slightly see this in the 4th photo on the listing). It says Beach Baby and has a butterfly in little rhinestones. I think it would be WAY cuter without this, especially since mine is just slightly off center which annoys me.\nThe rhinestones aren't super noticeable, but I would have gone with another suit if Id seen them initially. But Im still excited to hang on to this suit until it fits. Im sure my daughter will get plenty of use from it.\nI did receive this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

It looked super cute and I just knew my 3 year old would love it. She did love it. I did not. There were several issues I found with this suit. I bought a size 3t which is the size she wears. When she put on the suit the straps were so long that the top of the front of the suit fell to about an inch and a half below my daughters nipples. Luckily my mom is good with a sewing machine. She shortened the straps not once, but twice. After the second shortening the suit finally covered my daughters nipples but then my daughter complained of the suit being \"too tight.\" I just don't think this suit is made with the right proportions. The hat was also cute but fit super snug almost like a swim cap but with long strands to tie under the chin. My three year old was less than impressed. Also, you cannot see in the picture but there are silver decals on the front of this suit that say \"beach baby.\" Not appropriate for a three year old either.\n\nI received this suit at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review.", "summary": "Did not fit anywhere near expected", "unixReviewTime": 1469491200}

I have a 2 year old daughter who loves pink and ruffles. So I showed her this suit online and she got all excited! She wears size 2T so that is what I ordered and it fits perfectly. It is very well made. You can tell just by looking at the stitching. The fabric is stretchy so I don't have to worry about it not fitting once her swim diaper gets wet. The little bonnet that comes with it is just precious and will be very effective at keeping her hair out of her eyes while swimming. It will also be perfect for keeping her little scalp from getting sunburn, which has been a big problem in the past. She has very fine blonde hair and sensitive pale skin so she burns very easily. I love that this suit has the little clip that you can unfasten to put the suit on and off. It makes it a lot more comfortable for your little princess while you are struggling to dress her. Especially when you are trying to take off the wet suit! We all know how hard that can be! I couldn't be happier with this purchase. It is just the cutest and most high quality suit I've found for her, ever. I have posted pictures of the suit below. I tried it on my daughter but she was in a crabby mood at the time and refused to let me get her picture.(We all know how that goes too.)

I was worried the quality may not be so good, but was pleasantly surprised. It is not super heavy duty swim competition type material, but it is a nice stretchy swim suit type material that dries fast and does not retain a lot of water. Its thick enough to cover well but thin enough to still be stretchy. I purchased a size larger than my daughter needed, as she already has a suit for this year and I wanted her to be able to wear this next year. My daughter is 3.5 years old and wears a 4-5t so I purchased a 6t. It seems to fit her just a little bigger than she is now which is exactly what I was hoping so I have to say that this product is very true to its size and it should fit her splendidly next year!  The bathing suit is very cute with its leopard print and pink trim, a truly girly suit. The front offers all the modesty and coverage you would want with a child this young, and the back is very open but not in any awkward places. The cap is a bit small, as it should be to fit as a swim cap. It is made of the same material as the suit, and the only issue I had was that thee pink trim around the base of the cap is not a stretchy as the leopard material, which made it a bit hard for me to be able to put on my daughters head, but we managed just fine.

One thing I'm not a huge fan of is the rhinestone wording across the chest part of the suit, it is very hard to read against the leopard print background. The little hat that comes with this is adorable, but it is small, it is made of the same materials as the swimsuit, and has a little pink ruffle around it, as well as a tie below th in strap.

The color is as pictured -- vibrant and pretty, and easy to find in the depths of my large handbag.  If I could take off half a star, I would, because a little slip of paper fell out of the outer pocket that named a \"Suggested Retail Price\" of $12.00.

The sterling finish gives it a whiter and glossier look, whereas the platinum is more subdued. The chain is the perfect length.

It looks much more expensive than it is, so the price is right. The pendant is also a good size. I have purchased some anchor necklaces before for my cruises, and the pendant was oversized, and the chain was long. Not the look I was going for.  This size was as described in the pictured, almost the size of a nickel. The front of the pendant is raised, whereas as the back is flat. Since no one is seeing the back of the necklace, I have no issues with that. In fact, it helps the pendant lay flat\ninstead of twisting and turning, and sometimes tangling like other pendants.

I am going to try and get it tailored, but otherwise I love the length and the feel!", "summary": "No Need to Hesitate", "unixReviewTime": 1463616000}

The only reason I took off one star is because the leggings do not move and bend with me as well as some other brands that I have, and therefore they're not as comfortable to do yoga in. They are fine for running or walking, as those movements are very often the same throughout your entire workout. This is fine and I'm still glad to have this set for those purposes, but I do wish it was more versatile in that way.\n\nIt looks really cute together.

Right at the ankle, not too long, not too short.\nThe bra is a little strange feeling to get used to, but once you have it in the right place, it's fairly comfy!

It's a one-size deal, which I'm not the the biggest fan of. It arrived somehow in a small package, I don't know how they got it to fold like that. I would say the hoops inside were a little on the large side for my particular dress however it is adjustable by shortening the hoops and cutting off any excess. I also took the time to steam out the attached tulle to help it lay flatter. The material is smooth and feels comfortable. I only have pictures of the after. The first is after steaming it and adjusting the hoops and the view is somewhat from the side. The second picture is about midway through the process and taken from the side/back.

I go to formal events every year which require ball gowns, cocktail dresses, etc., so often bypass particular gowns due to not being able to get just the right amount of fullness at the base without adding girth around my waist and hips.\nMy problem is solved with this petticoat.  Two hoops and a few layers of tulle are attached to a stretchy slip that form fits without binding and gently smooths any lumps and bumps on my hips & backside.  Very light weight, easy to step into and pull up over my hips.\nTo store, I turn inside out, fold & twist the hoops in half, plop it into a pillow case, & hang on a clothes hanger (hard to describe the twisting motion, but if you have experience with pop up laundry hampers, you know what I mean by twisting the hoops).\n\nThe price point is excellent and I am extremely pleased with how well this was sewn.  It provides the perfect amount of fullness that would benefit those of you who want \"just enough\" belling at the bottom of a gown.  Cosplayers out there, this is right up your alley.

I don't really know why but I always gravitate toward them. These sunglasses are mirrored and aviator style. They are quite large - actually too large for my face but I still wear them. I chose the gold color for a change. Most of my aviators are silver. The glasses are well made with a good weight to them. They are not loose on my face like so many sunglasses are. It is the lenses that are really big on me. Then again, big sunglasses are the style these days.\n\nThese come nicely boxed and, inside, is a case that is well constructed but is cardboard. You can still use it as carry case because it s sturdy or transfer the glasses to your own case. There is a little lens cloth in there as well.\n\nThe glasses cut glare and keep everything sharp. There is no distortion with these. They fit comfortably and don't slide down even when I look down. I attached a picture of myself wearing them. I am embarrassed to post pics of myself but I think it will give you a good idea of the size. I have an average sized face.\n\nI think these would be great if the lenses were a tad smaller. They are still quality glasses and I will wear them. I wore them the other day and they really did a good job keeping the sun out of my eyes. These are unisex and would look great on a guy because they are larger. But women as well can wear these. If I could change one more thing besides the lens size, it would be that they would be polarized. Otherwise, I'm rocking my big glasses and keeping crow's feet at bay by not squinting in the sun! The quality is much higher than cheap sunglasses at a drugstore!\n\n**I received these glasses n exchange for my honest, unbiased review. I have no affiliation at all with the seller and did not agree or promise to write a positive review. I also was not compensated in any way for this review. I took a while to write this because I was on the fence about the lens size and whether than was a con.

They don't apply excess pressure to my temples. This is great for me and allows for long term wear. The lenses are extremely mirrored. The product listing really doesn't depict this well. I hope my photos help you appreciate how mirrored these are. Overall, I really enjoy these sunglasses. They help break up the monotony of my normal style.

Too wide to be considered a skinny tie, too narrow to fall into regular width ties (they're 3.25\"). For a broad man it will look like a skinny tie, for a very slender man it will look like regular, for average man it will be something questionable in between. Also, this width doesn't work in style with most of the regular tie bars/clips so you need to use skinny tie bar/clip if you want to look sharp.\n- Fiber. It says \"100% microfiber\" and I have no ideas what it is. Feels kind of rough and not nearly as soft as good quality ties. Creases very easily and doesn't keep smooth shape as good as better ties.\n- Colors and design. As pictured, no complaints about it, bright and attractive designs. Beside creasing and not keeping shape well they look good.\n\nSummary. I have about a dozen of \"famous makers\" ties like Michael Kors, Geoffrey Beene etc. and of course these ties can't be even compared to them by the quality, look and feel, but the price... they worth more than $3 each.\nI would never wear these odd Scott Malone ties for a job interview or a fancy date, for such occasions be smart and spend $25-30 on a high quality tie that looks really sharp, but for something like everyday business casual work environment these microfiber ties can work and they come in many different colors and patterns so for the cost of one high quality tie you can get like 9 different of these.", "summary": "Worth the price but there is something you have to consider", "unixReviewTime": 1497398400}

The cups are lined and padded for discretion and it has a racer back straps.\n\nBy far, this is one of the most comfortable sports bras I have ever worn. It is light and airy feeling which allows your skin to breathe while sweating!\n\nThe XL fit me perfectly, however; it was not super tight like other sports bras I have so I did bounce around a little bit while jogging but not to much to where it was uncomfortable.

Somewhere in the middle between heavy, super tight support to light fitting, no support.\n\nThe ONLY thing I did not like about this bra was while I was running the top portion of the zipper kept coming down . It would go down about an inch and stop there! Thank God for the added protection of the hook but it never went down that far. I only noticed it after taking off my shirt each day so maybe the friction and bouncing from running caused it.\n\nPros:\nVery comfortable\nExtra security hook behind zipper\nPadded for discretion\nBreathable material\nVery soft\nMedium support\nGreat fit\n\nCons:\nZipper coming down\nMedium support for busty women\n\nDISCLAIMER: I received this product for free for my ALWAYS fair, ALWAYS honest and ALWAYS unbiased review.

If the zipper was better, I think I would definitely give this sports bra 5 stars, as it is actually well made minus the zipper issue (and very comfortable). There are molded pads in the bra too for some extra coverage and support. I think that this sports bra would work just fine for smaller busted women, but for me, I could never use it to work out in.

The chain part of the key chain is connected to the back of the ship. I think it would look cooler attached to the front, because it hangs upside down. But for the price this is a great key chain.

It seems to be very sturdy.\n\nI am happy to add this key chain to my keys which already include a Borg cube flash light key chain, and a Star Trek communications badge key chain (the Star trek triangle insignia).\n\nI have received this product for a discounted price or for free in exchange for my honest review.

Morgan", "reviewText": "These just arrived in the mail today, so I haven't been able to evaluate how well they will hold up, but now I'm wondering...\nThey arrived packaged very nicely in a pretty green box and were securely wrapped.  I received a tiny bag of earring backs (lots of rubber ones and one set of metal ones).  The earrings were tiny and delicate as I expected.  They are slightly smaller than an identical design I have purchased from Ann Taylor earlier this year.  So as far as looks go, they are great.\nI went to put the metal earring back on the earring and the post bent!  It is very soft metal and seems that the gauge of the post is too fat to go in the metal back.  I tried the rubber backs with the same result.  Thankfully I was able to bend the post back in place.  I tried other rubber backs that I already owned and was finally successful with a completely different earring back (the kind with a larger plastic disk and metal back).\nOther than the SOFT metal that the post is made of and the fact that the earring backs provided don't fit, I really like these earrings.  I love my Ann Taylor pair in gold, so was happy to find this pair in silver.  If you're not overly concerned with quality and are willing to have earrings that are fragile, these are lovely.", "summary": "Pretty but fragile", "unixReviewTime": 1477267200}

I was very excited to review the stress because I thought it would be the perfect addition to a summer wardrobe and like the flexibility of changing the tap to look more appropriate for different types of social situations. I have included pictures of three ways I have worn the dress and how I assembled the top. I bought a size medium and I'm 5 foot 7 inches tall. It fits me perfectly but if you were shorter than that it would drag on the floor in this size. I do recommend making sure you have white or neutral colored underwear on underneath as any type of colored or print would show through on the light. I used a sports bra with the dress but you could put a tank top on underneath to cover up a bra. I am not one to go without support so I did not try it without a bra on.\nIf you look in the photos you will see there is a full length mirror behind me so that you can see what the back looks like when I have it tied each way. Some ways will show more skin in the back than others. If you don't like that then I suggest wearing a tank top underneath.

It goes all the way to my ankles and Im 5ft7. I got size large. The belly is a bit snug, but otherwise, perfect fit and the rest is following. I recommend throwing it on over your head and not stepping through it if you got some curvy hips. The straps are super long, you tie up around your neck and then again under the girls. Can look very beautiful! Can also make it into a turtle neck/scarf necked dress. Can show some cleavage or cover them up. Very easy to dress up, dress down and wear multiple ways. I can even make this into a skirt, tie the top around the back, make a bow and have a beautiful flowing back side. Very nice from the waist down, its just a bit tight on the mid section for me. Im working on losing weight, so I will be very very happy with this dress then. In the meantime, it really doesnt look that bad on me at all.

Once the dress was removed from the box, the perpetual shower of sequins began.  I assumed I would lose some here and there, but I literally had to drag my vacuum cleaner around to pick up after myself.  Ignoring the mess, I tried on the dress.  The fit was horrible.  The top of my dress did not have as deep of a V as the picture shown; the \"V\" stopped just under my collar bone.  The ruching on the chest was uneven (some substantially wider than others) and stuck out away from my chest.  The shoulder straps were wider than in picture.  There are bra cups sewn into the dress and they in no way cupped my breast, but rather sat on the upper part of them.  The dress zipped up, but was not flattering at all.  I order many dresses online and am pretty good at assessing my measurement, I even ordered up a size in this dress.  IMHO, I feel the dress in the picture is not the \"knock off\" I received.  Unfortunately, my event was only 2 days after my dress arrived, so I went with a dress I already owned.

I would purchase items from this company again.\n\n[[ASIN:B01DKIS7QW Yayabb Baby Boy Cotton Long-sleeve Rompers Newborn Baby Boys Clothes (7-12 months, Light Blue 2)]", "summary": "Very nice sleeper!

I love the design of these glasses as they are one of a kind to any others I own.  I chose the black/gold frame with grey lenses and they match with just about any outfit choice.  Included with the glasses is a nice fabric drawstring pouch and cleaning cloth.\n\nThe glasses are black with a pop of gold color in the frames.  They have round black lenses, unlike some of the other color selections these are not mirrored.  They aren't oversized but do cover the whole eye area and most of the brow bone.  The frames have a cat eye look to them being pointed in the upper corners.  This style is really popular in Hollywood right now amongst the celebrities.\n\nThe glasses have comfort grips behind the ear area on the arms.  They also have clear padded nose clips for comfort.  I could wear these all day and forget I even have them on.  When I am not wearing them I can sit them on top of my head as well as use them to hold my hair back when out in the hot sun.\n\nThese glasses offer 100% protection against harmful UVA/UVB rays.  I wear these often as they are very stylish and trendy drawing attention and compliments.  I look forward to purchasing another color of the same design.\n\nIf your looking for style, comfort, and protection this is sure to please your needs.  I highly recommend this pair of sunglasses.  I received this item free in exchange for my honest unbiased review.  All opinions are 100% my own.

I have and old black belt from Nautica that is very similar to this belt.  The key differences between this belt and that one are primarily in the leather and the buckle.  The leather on this belt has a very nice soft feel as if it is already broken in.  However, the leather is so soft that after just a few days or wearing it I have already noticed that the leather is bunching up around the belt loops.  This belt already has more creasing and belt loop marks than my old Nautica belt that I have been wearing for the past several years.  The second drawback about this belt is the clasp.  The metal rolling tube that the belt slides one has a seam.  This seam impedes the belt from rolling on smoothly. Admittedly this is a small concern and not a big issue but its just not something you will see on a more expensive belt.  Despite the drawbacks that I listed this belt has a beautiful color, feel, and nice leather smell.  Plus it is made in the USA which is always nice.\n\nDisclaimer:  I received this product at a free or reduced rate to provide an honest and unbiased review.

We got an opportunity to purchase this one from Boston Leather at a discounted price, in exchange for a detailed evaluation and honest review. I'm glad we ordered it but wish it were a little higher quality.\n\nThe sizing is right on target. Hubby wears size 34 waist trousers, and the recommended 36-inch belt is a perfect fit. The leather is nicely finished and the understated buckle is what my husband wanted. A lot of the wild buckles look cool online, but most of the men I know want basic. This one's basic. There's a metal roll tube at the outer edge of the buckle, which I guess serves some purpose but honestly looks kind of tacky. It doesn't really serve much purpose, unless it's to reinforce what lies inside. I've seen belts like that before and thought the idea went out in the 90's..\n\nI can't give it more stars because it's good enough, but nothing spectacular. As other people noted, the leather is soft. For a lot of things, softer is better. For a belt you want a bit more rigidity. I don't know how long this one will last, and assume it won't be very long.

The leather on this belt as well as the closure seem to be well built and sturdy, I can't imagine the leather wearing out on this belt too quickly and the closure itself seems quite durable as well. One thing to note is the \"Stretch\" part of this belt. I have had issues in the past with elastics losing the elasticity and further staying stretched out. I certainly hope that doesn't happen here, but if it does I will update this review.

It seems to be solid leather, rather than some kind of composite man-made material, made of leather, and who knows what else?

Also disappointing was that the finished surface of the belt was quite noticeably  scuffed on the 4 inches, or so, at the end with the holes.  I am assuming it was because the belt was shipped in very lightweight flexible packaging, and as the belt was wound with the scuffed end on the outside of the coil, that the finished surface was damaged from some kind of rubbing in transit.  At least that is what I stated in my review of the packaging.  I prefer to think that the packaging was at fault, and not because the belt was sold, worn a bit by someone, returned, and then resold as new.  Although I am not sure, and the more I wear it, the more I question my theory of poor packaging as the only cause.\n\nOn a more positive note, I must agree that this belt is better than most.

Can wear as a crossbody bag and adjust the straps, or use the wrist strap. It's so versatile and has more room than other mini bags, can hold more than just her phone, and has a good number of compartments that are quick and easy to get to.\n\nThe material is like a textured faux leather, feels great and doesn't look \"cheap\". Also easy to wipe clean. This is really a great deal for the list price also- wish they still had in the tan pictured color, for I would buy that one also!

Carhartt canvas clothing is tough -and so is this pack which makes me happy! My favorite pocket is on the back of the pack- perfect size for keeping money and great location for that purpose. So far, the only use has been as a daypack: from ATV mud rides to trips to town in the car- but I'm looking forward to taking this pack for some extended travel in the future...\n\nI received this item at a discount for an honest product review.", "summary": "Love my \"Carhartt\" Tough Pack!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1464480000}

I typically wear a US size 2 or a small/ medium in similar styles at retailers like Victoria's Secret, Kohls or JCPenney. I ordered the \"Bestlife Ladies Sexy Lingerie Tempting Sling Dress For Sleepwear\" in a size medium. It fits me very well. The bust is a halter style, which is adjustable. It fits snug in the chest and flairs open below. The babydoll is on the shorter side, hitting around the hips. The set includes a matching pair of boyshort style panties. Together, this is a cute set to wear to bed. The see through nature of the top makes it a difficult sell for wearing around the house, but this is great for feeling sexy at bedtime.\n\nThe material is soft synthetic blend. It is very easy to care for. I can wash and dry this garment with like colors on normal settings. The hems and lace detailing are well constructed and smooth and comfortable against the skin. The lace is not itchy. I definitely recommend the \"Bestlife Ladies Sexy Lingerie Tempting Sling Dress For Sleepwear\" as a gift for yourself or the lady in your life. This is one of my most comfortable babydolls. I wish it was available in multiple colors. It is very competitively priced. Similar items at Victoria's Secret retail for $40+ and then you are charged shipping fees when ordering through their website. This item is $15 with shipping. It ships from overseas, which takes roughly 2 weeks. Overall, the price and quality are unbeatable.\n\nI hope you found this review helpful. If so, I'd appreciate you clicking the \"helpful\" button!", "summary": "Super Comfortable Sexy Style", "unixReviewTime": 1471305600}

The following statements are my TRUE opinions of the product.\n\nAppearance:  This bag is so adorable.  I bought it for my husband and he is so happy with it.  He says it makes him feel like Indiana Jones...  I don't know about that, but it really does have a nice look to it.  The only thing I don't really like is that the leather piece on the front says some weird things.  The way that it is worded makes it very obvious this bag was made in a country where the main language is NOT English.\n\nConstruction/ Functionality: This bag is surprisingly well made.  Stitching is well done, and there are magnetic snaps rather than velcro. (no one likes velcro.)  I love that there are so many different pockets to hold so many different things.  We took the bag on vacation immediately after it came in the mail and it was a wonderful way to carry items needed for tourism events.\n\nShipping Packaging:  This item came expediently and packaged nicely in a cardboard box.\n\nBottom Line:  This bag is so awesome, I now want to buy one for myself.", "summary": "Hubby thinks he's Indiana Jones.", "unixReviewTime": 1466380800}

He works for the Forest Service and wants to be able to carry more than he can fit in his pockets, but has little need for a full sized bag. In this respect, the size is perfect. He is able to carry his wallet, an 8 inch tablet, his smart phone, spare battery, his work phone, a small flashlight, his multi-tool, cigarettes, lighter and his stop smoking aides (lol), keys, work gloves, a few other small sundries without the bag looking overwhelmingly full. The photos attached (of the bag full) are from after nearly 3 full weeks of use, they show the items that are in the bag and how they fit in, just to give you an idea of the capacity.\n\nThe bag has a flap over the front that uses magnetic snaps for closure. Under the flap there is a flat open pocket (slide in a notebook and pen, perhaps?) attached to a slightly larger zipper pocket. This zipper pocket is attached to the man portion of the bag, which is the largest of the pockets. This pocket has fabric and a drawstring to keep your items secure. On each side of the bag you'll find a small mesh pocket and on one side is a very small pocket with a flap and button.\n\nFrom a construction standpoint, the bag seems to be well made. The canvas fabric is nice and thick, all of the stitching is solid and all of the buckles, leather and straps are firmly attached. In the weeks we've had it, it has been used daily, taken into the forest, tossed into trucks, dropped on the ground and is holding up very well so far.\n\nThere are a couple of things that I might change about this bag if given the opportunity. Probably most notable being the side pocket. It is quite small. Not nearly large enough for a smart phone. It works for us because the work phone being used in there is an older style phone (think small flip) but if I were relying on that space to hold my smartphone, I'd be disappointed. Additionally, I'd like to see the buckles used as actual buckles rather than as decor. The magnetic snaps are working fantastically, but I could see the buckles potentially lasting longer.\n\nAll in all I'd recommend this bag and would certainly buy it again if we found ourselves in need of something similarly sized.", "summary": "It's bigger on the inside...", "unixReviewTime": 1464739200}

It pulled up to a really nice area, high waist, hiding the tummy.  I really liked the product and was sad thinking I would have to return it because the stitching was on the outside between the pants and waist band.  Then figured out I was supposed to pull the top band down! Dum Dum.  Once I pulled it down, it all made sense. Duh.  However, once I was wearing it correctly, it wasn't high waist for me anymore.

Plus, they look amazing.  My son swears these are the most comfortable cleats he's ever worn and he never complains of his feet hurting after hours on the field.  We are a family on a budget, but I feel like the price of these is definitely justified - like I said, he's gotten 2 seasons of wear out of them, which is just crazy given how many practices and games they've been through.

Sharpe", "reviewText": "With their low price, my expectations for for these belts were modest but I was very pleasantly surprised when they arrived.  The metal buckle is very substantial and sturdy, the webbing is heavy, and the belt is very well put together and looks as if it will last a long, long time.  A couple of things to be aware of:  The webbing is pretty wide (around 2\" wide).  It will fit nicely in regular sized belt loops, but may be too wide for  very narrow loops.  The webbing is nylon and is a little shiny, which is noticeable in the lighter colors, (but not so much in the black).  I think probably they will get less shiny with use, but at first they are a little shiny.  Also, in order to keep the webbing from unravelling, the webbing has been melted a bit at the open end of the belt.  Again, in the dark colors this is not noticeable, but in the lighter colors, it introduces a bit of discoloration.  For me a web belt like this is for practical, casual use and these slight cosmetic issues don't matter.  Overall I think these belts are a great value.", "summary": "Great Value!", "unixReviewTime": 1475107200}

The stitching is well done and the fabric is nice. The diamond pattern is attractive and not too busy. The tie could easily be worn in a professional as well as a casual setting.

There were a few loose strings but I was able to cut them off without any issues.

It has a great modern pattern and overall a great quality and construction. As soon as I received the ties, I unpacked them from the plastic wrap and hand washed them. The tie did not fade and held up fine even when I used the steam kit in my dryer. The great thing about these ties is that they match many different shirts and colors.\n\nOverall, my experience with the tie was wonderful. The shipping was fast and arrived in the provided timeframe and the product arrived undamaged. If you're shopping for new ties to enhance your wardrobe then you have found your match!

Typically when I buy swimsuits they either fit me really well around the top and are loose every place, or vice Versa. I purchased color B6 in this suit and went with a size M and it fit me awesome (I really didn't have high expectations for that and had planned to do some altering, but there's no need to do any alters as this suit fits beautifully!)\n\nIN LOVE. I chose this particular style and pattern because I loved the bohemian vibe of it. I envisioned wearing this suit to all the music festivals I have plans to go to this summer and love that it doubles as a bodysuit. I totally would wear this swimsuit out at night under a pair of cut offs. I paired the suit up with a few different shorts & outfits in the photos I posted to help you out if you are undecided on whether or not this is a good style for you. Hopefully it helps show you how adorable this bathing suit is alone AND as an actual day or night time outfit.\n\nSIZING & FIT. This is definitely cut on the smaller size and could vary depending on your body type. I am about a 34D up top, but can normally size down to a 32 and go with DD. My waist is about 24-25 inches around and I normally chose an XS or SM in US sizes. The medium in this suit fit me excellent (I would be swimming in a medium size if this was based off of a US size chart). The material is stretchy, however I would definently recommend sizing up 1-2 sizes depending on body shape. If you have a smaller bust, but thicker booty, I think sizing up by 1 would work... if you have a larger bust and thicker booty, I would probably size up by 2 in this swimsuit style.\n\nAnother thing that really helped draw me to this suit is the high cut neck. I love the high cut neck look for this summer. The black and white tribal-ish pattern on the suit is adorable. Also, the low cut back with the criss crossed straps look awesome when you put this suit on. The legs are higher cut so it doesn't cut your legs off and make shorter legged gals look even shorter. If you were blessed with really long legs, this suit will look even more amazing on you.\n\nFEELS. The material isn't the most luxurious. It's basic swimsuit material. I can promise you though that no one is going to look at you and think what you're wearing looks cheap. I am extremely particular about what I wear and would be embarrassed to put something on if I thought it made me look cheap. I would HAPPILY wear this suit out in public and would flaunt it at that. It's THAT cute. I did receive this swimsuit to sample for free, but a positive review was not a requirement. I only give five stars to products, whether I paid full price or recieved a discount, when the review is deserved.\n\nOverall, I would absolutely recommend this swimsuit I tried. It is cute, it fits me great, and it doubles as an outfit as well as a swimsuit.\n\nI know it's always tough trying to make a decision on size, especially when it comes to Asian sizing vs US. I would be happy to answer any questions or send additional pics of the suit if you comment below. I can try and help you out as best as I can so you chose the right size for you!

It fits in a purse easily and doesn't take up a lot of space. I usually just add my items to it and just grab it and go into the store It's less stuff I have to carry and it's not bulky at all.

I have a 25 - 25 1/2 inch head, which is a US size 8 or XXXL. Needless to say, it's hard to find hats that fit right. Well, this thing is so stretchy I really think it can fit any head. It is certainly snug, but not uncomfortably so. And I assume it will form more to the size of my head the more I wear it.\n\nThe knitting seems very thick and durable. It's not overly soft, but then, I wasn't expecting it to be. I really like that it's VERY long. Long enough to cover your entire head if it's rolled out. I've had problems with hats like this being too short in the past and either slowly coming off my head or not covering my ears completely.\n\nSo far, I've only gotten to wear it outside when the temperature was about 35 F. It kept my head plenty warm and blocked the wind sufficiently. What i was really surprised about is that even wearing it inside for a while, my head didn't get uncomfortably hot or anything. Wool is a great temperature regulating material for a large range of temperatures. Now it may not be warm enough when the temperature drops super low, but then I bought it to use in combination with my jacket hood.

I ordered a Large and it fit comfortably, not too tight with some room in the belly area!\n\nThe bottom of the dress sort of flares out a bit like a mermaid tail, so that gives the dress a bit of elegance.\n\nThe material is pretty thick, which is a test to the quality of this dress. The dress is already pretty revealing and it would be a shame if it looked cheap too. Well this dress does not look cheap! It makes me feel confident wearing it. It's super lightweight with just the right amount of cling but not too much where you would feel stuffed or that the dress is too tight (if you order your correct size of course). Sorry I didn't really upload pics of the front of the dress. It's pretty basic though, it's all about the back!! But the front is a regular tank top style, everything is covered. You can kind of see in the side body picture I uploaded.\n\nI was self conscious about my back fat/rolls so I ordered a strappy bralette to cover that particular area. So that's why you see straps going up my back. That's not part of the dress!!! The dress is cut out just like the model's in the display picture.

I went about my day, as I left the house to do some errands.  To my delight, I forgot I was even wearing it at all.  I attributed it to the fact that I don't usually wear thin chains at all.  After wearing it for a few days, I became used to it and I got a few compliments.  The one thing I was disappointed in was, I thought it would be a clear crystal piece all the way around, instead of the setting it was placed in.  However, it is still very pretty and I like the bail with crystals that surrounds the top of it and comes down on the side.\nPros: The chain is pretty, and I like the tiny smooth silver connectors placed intermittently within the chain itself.  The pendant is gorgeous and the facets casts some shimmering lights off it.\n Cons: The chain is too delicate and too short for a pendant this large.\nDisclaimer:  I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for testing the product and giving my honest review.", "summary": "Brilliant glimmers", "unixReviewTime": 1465689600}

Soft material, reinforced elastic, true to size and well made. No shrinkage or color fading through multiple washes. These are great boxers.\n\n SIZE, MATERIAL  & DESIGN: Right out of the package, these feel very soft. The hems are also soft and the inside hems are not abrasive.  The inside of the elastic band is not hemmed over with the same material as the boxers themselves, but is lined with what feels like a terrycloth-like fabric.  The elastic stretches to about double its size.  Because it is lined in the terrycloth, it seems like it is stronger and will last longer than non-reinforced elastic.\n\n USING THEM: I am a female, but often wear boxers for lounge-wear. They are true to size and fit exactly like I expected them to. They are soft and I cannot feel the hems  which is a huge deal because and I have sensitive skin, and often wear things inside out because of it.  I have been these them for three weeks and through several washings there is no fading or shrinking. They are comfortable and serviceable.\n\n NOTE: If you found this helpful, please click YES!

I'm 5'8\" tall with a 27.5\" waist and a 34B bra size.  I bought a size Medium.  I'm happy with the way it hugs my waist, but it really doesn't fit my chest whatsoever.  I have roughly 1/2\" to almost 3/4\" of empty space in the cup.  Even though they list 34B as being the largest cup size that'd fit in the Medium, I think you'd have to be a C or D cup to actually have it fit as intended (or possibly have a larger bust size).\n\nI marked it as 'Fit as Expected' only because it hugged my waist as intended and has a nice length.  It's just the chest area that fit too loosely.\n\nThe material of the shirt is nice and soft with a slight bit of stretch.  It is not see through in any location even when stretched a bit with your hands.\n\nThe padding of the bra feels nice and seems like it would be comfortable if it had actually fit well.\n\nGiven that I was at the upper extreme for the suggested body size to fit a size M and it was was actually overly loose in the chest, I really can't suggest this shirt to anyone.  It's a gamble as to if it will fit you properly or not given their suggested sizing.  The side view picture that I'm attaching alludes to the large gap in the bra fitment.\n\nThe shirt was sold to me at a discounted price in exchange for my review.

The middle of the cami has a deeper \"V\" then what the pictures show and unless you decide to wear another bra with this shirt or have ample size in the chest area it will be very loose. The material of the cami are good enough and look like they will hold up when washed but how the bra is attached leaves much to be desired. The fabric is soft and the color I choose for my wife was black and it is a nice shade of black.\n\nThe best I could say to do would be to possibly get a size down from your normal size if lacking in the size department or as stated earlier wear a bra with the shirt. Also the shirt seemed to be a tad bit short compared to the picture as well. Might be something to consider if yo are a taller lady. I hate to keep coming back to this and stressing it but please really consider buying this if you think you will not be able to fill the shirt in, it will be a major headache for you if the size is too big.\n\nI'm giving this cami an overall 3 star rating because of how the \"V\" in the middle of the cami is deeper than the images show and because of the included padded bra being more of a hindrance then an enhancer. I think if the padded bra size could also be chosen or even toned down a bit it would be better overall.\n\nI received this product for a discounted and or free price.

I can always use more tank tops since they are a staple in my wardrobe. I like that they are very versatile, and that they offer great coverage for layering clothes.

I ordered a large, and I received what I felt to be more of a medium size range for my particular body type, so I would say that this item runs small. The fit is nice and comfortable, and the fabric is very soft. I imagine this will be something I wear a good bit, but there is one design flaw. the cups seems to ride up on me, and they don't really want to stay in place. I am not sure what this is all about, since the shirt itself should be pretty snug and secure. I guess it's just one of those things where my body type doesn't match the design of the top.

The tag is in an Asian language, so I cannot be sure, but it says 90% and 10% of something; I am assuming that the 90% is Modal. I didn't know what Modal is, so I looked it up. It is a type of Rayon made from the fibers of a Beech tree. It is not a totally natural fiber because the pulp from the tree is processed using chemicals. It is cool to the touch, wicks away moisture, very absorbent and less likely to pill than cotton. The fabric is nice; soft and smooth. It is not too thin; it can be worn without a bra underneath. At the same time, it is not too thick, it will be cool to wear in the summer heat.\n\nI am 5 8 tall weigh 125 and wear a 34B. Using the size chart, I chose to order a size large. The padded cup is about the right size on me. After adjusting the straps, it fit pretty well. The body of it fits a bit loose, perhaps a Medium would have fit better. The only time that I had an issue with the cups slipping was when I laid down while wearing it. I think if it were just a little tighter, I would not have a problem at all. In color, I chose to order purple. It is a very nice light basic shade; not overly vibrant. It will be easy to match it to many items in my wardrobe.\n\nOverall, I like this camisole; I think that I look attractive while wearing it. It certainly helps my figure to look better. It appears to me to be well made; the stitching is straight, even and solid. I would recommend this product to women with a smaller bust size. I don't think it would fit right on women who wear a B cup or smaller.\n\nI received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my HONEST and UNBIASED opinion.", "summary": "Great cami -  but not for large busted women", "unixReviewTime": 1469664000}

I do not like coats that are to tight and make it hard to wear layers with them.  I am 5' 4\" and 118 lbs and the small was very comfortable.  I had plenty of room in it to wear two layers of clothing under it and still be able to breathe and zip it up and have a bit of room.  So I was very happy with the look at fit of the coat.  I gave it a 2 because of the smell.  I can't wear this coat because of how strong the faux leather smell is.  It smelled up my whole living room and kitchen as soon as I took it out of the box.  I looked online to try to find ways to reduce the smell.  I wiped vinegar on it 4 times and let it dry.  I tried putting it in a container with baking soda.  I tried washing it.  Nothing seems to get rid of this smell.  It makes me embarrassed to wear it anywhere because of just how strong it smells.  So while I love this coat...I don't really wear it as much as I want because of the smell.  If I'm going to be around a lot of people, I just can't wear it cause its over powering.  I really hope after wearing it some it will tame the smell...but so far it has not.\n\nUPDATE:  As I stated above, I do not wear this coat often because of the smell.  I went to wear it today and noticed that after 3 times of wearing it the lining the in the pocket already had a whole in it and the seam for the lining of the arm already has a hole it in.

He has clip on ties and finds them very annoying.  To add to it, when he got to school this year, one of his teachers stated that he wears a bow tie every Monday to help him get over the \"Monday blues.\"  Now my son wants to wear one every Monday too.  These are absolutely adorable.  They are large enough for a man, but they are cute with the texture/pattern so I'm not overly sure that a man would appreciate them as much as a young boy.  They came individually wrapped.  The colors are muted and the material is silky.  There is ample room in the adjustable neck to fit a larger man and they adjust to a size small enough to fit my son's neck too.  He loves these.  And quite frankly, any day my kid decides to wear something nicer than jeans, a t'shirt, and a sweatshirt to school is a good dressed up day.  I got these six adjustable bow ties for free or at a substantial discount.

I chose this top on a whim, looking for something flattering but comfortable to wear with skinny jeans or leggings. I've had bad luck with tunics in the past-- too shapeless; but the cut of this one looked promising. And good news-- it's every bit as flattering as the model pic suggests. For reference, I'm 5'5\" about 148ish, size 8-10; and I ordered a large in black. Perfect fit-- body-skimming up top, looser from the rib cage down, but not bag-like. The best part is the sleeve length-- sometimes the three-quarter cut makes me look sorta T-Rex-like, but this length is just right. Dainty even.\n\nI really like the weight and quality. It's definitely not chintzy-thin. It's a decent quality material that just so happens to not be thick. The blue color is fantastic and gives it a semi-pricey feel. Good buy!\n\nI received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "and I am never inclined to write a review-- regardless of whether I love or hate something", "unixReviewTime": 1469059200}

I consider a tunic to be a shirt that covers your butt and that you can wear leggings with - this top is not really a tunic in that sense but is still a great shirt. The fabric is super soft and high-quality, great stitching (no loose threads, snags, etc.) and it is very comfortable. My only gripe is with the length (since it does not cover your bottom  at least, for me, and I am 58). Other than that, it is a great shirt to dress up with a statement necklace or wear more casually.\n\nPros:\n-Soft, high-quality fabric\n-Comfortable\n-Pretty flattering\n-Well-made\n\nCons:\n-Not long enough\n-Arms are kind of small\n\nOrdering Experience/Customer Service (5/5): Ordering was a breeze and very satisfactory. I did not have to contact the seller or their customer service for any reason  everything went smoothly and I am happy with my purchase! I received updates on the status of it every step of the way  it was updated and I was never left wondering where my package was.\n\nShipping (5/5): Shipping was SO FAST  THANK YOU, SELLER! I was so excited each time I received a shipping update on my phone and was continuously surprised how fast it got here! It wasn't Prime eligible because it is an individually made craft, but when I was tracking the shipment via the tracking number, I couldn't believe how quickly it was traveling! Like I said, the shipping info was updated accurately and in real-time, so I was confident knowing I was one step closer to getting my package and that it would get here on time!\n\nPackaging/First Site (5/5): It arrived in a box and wrapped within that. It was carefully packaged where it had no chance of getting ruined.\nSizing (4/5): Too short, but fits everywhere else as expected.\nOverall (4/5):\nWould I order the item again? Yes!\nWould I order other items from this seller based on the product and service? YES! Win-win! '\n\nJust a note - I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion  the discount did not affect my review or opinion of the item and I hope this review helps others determine whether or not this product is right for them. Im happy to answer any additional questions in regard to my personal experience.

If it is real lamb skin, then it must only be a small percentage of the bag, like the zipper handle or something. The quilted part wrinkled when I put it down and hasn't returned to its original supple form, which is one of the traits real lambskin leather is suppose to have. When you press on one of the quilt squares it has a similar feeling to pushing your fingers through the plastic produce bags in grocery stores, definitely not rubbery like they said in a leather article. The zippers feel incredibly cheap and they get stuck and after zipping it closed the zipper chain opens again. Same with the inside zipper. The inside lining feels flimsy and moves all over the place. I have a bag similar in design but smaller and a lot cheaper and was expecting the SUSU bag to be a lot better quality than my Christian Lacroix bag, but this felt like it's only worth $5. I'm assuming the gold metal on the bag is paint since it was already chipped. I'm clumsy so after a month of using this bag, it would probably look like garbage.

Great with dressy ensemble.  Only thing I would have liked more is if the strap would have been a complete chain, with leather running through the links and maybe a detachable tassel.

This SUSU style allows wearer to stand at a party or reception and open bag with one hand, and nothing falls out. . The flap type with a chain or strap running through the top of the flap instead of having grommets or other attachment on side of purse panel like this purse has leaves a gap where small items can fall out (pens, lipsticks) if purse is tilted while closed,  and requires two hands to open and get something out. Not a good thing if one is standing holding a plate or drink at reception/intermission time or do not have a table to set the purse on while opening.

It was hard to see at first since it is black material and black thread but there are areas that the sewing machine operator sewed outside the correct area and then just re-sewed over it to make it work and still left the mistake instead of fixing it first.

When I first saw it on Amazon, I thought the top with the design was metal studs. When I received it  I was surprised to find out it was just printing on the fabric, hence, the title says: Foil print and not studding. It was my mistake but I have to say that it is BEAUTIFUL and highly detailed!\n\nI ordered the size XL  I am a size 12-14. This fits PERFECTLY!!!!! That means this seller makes their garments in United States sizing. This also comes in 3 different colors  I got the black. It is VERY jet black and the silver print on the neckline is really noticeable. The silver is not super shiny  it is more a matte silver. But honestly I think it would have been too much with the shiny silver and it looks perfect the way it is!\n\nThe dress comes down past my knees  this makes it appropriate for work if you wear a cardigan and pantyhose with it. I put a black cardigan with it because it is short sleeved anyways, and it looks so cute. The back of this dress also has a zipper, but the fabric is super stretchy so I just pull it over my head and smooth it down, it works fine. Also the sleeves come to the perfect length and are not just capped but a little longer. The neckline has that nice cutout that gives it a sexy bit of flare. I have washed this in cold water in a garment bag and hung it dry and it turns out beautiful. It also doesnt need ironing which makes it perfect for travel. I LOVEEEE this dress and I think you will too! 5/5 stars\n\nIf you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a free promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "The perfect black dress!", "unixReviewTime": 1461542400}

I returned it and ordered a large which is a good fit but it is very hard to zip up as mentioned some of the other reviewed once you get it on and hooked. Not sure why since its not like I feel that its tooo tight or suffocated once it is zipped all the way up. I do know though that part of the problem is that the hooks get the way of the zipper as if they don't sit back far enough. I mostly use this particular waist trainer to work out in and it is pretty uncomfortable when doing so because it bends at an awkward point in stomach that happens to  rest between one of the gaps in between the hooks.

I came out the next morning to find everything strewn all over the front yard!  (I had to tape cash back together and get new credit/bank cards -- she even chewed my driver's license in 3 pieces.  I had an interesting time explaining that to the guy at the DMV)  :)  The wallet itself (surprisingly) did not have too much damage, as the zipper had been chewed off and there was a slight hole in one of the corners.

The case does a pretty good job at protecting my phone - I have dropped it a few times and have not seen any damage.

Also, the folding piece has started to break down from being used so much.  This is to be expected, of course, but I wish the case manufacturer had made it with a more durable coating so the coloring stayed longer.  That said, I love my case and I haven't seen one that is more appealing to me, so I'm just going to order another of what I already have and replace when my current case gets too run-down looking.  I don't think I could really expect more from something priced so low.\n\nIf you are hoping to use this case as your wallet, too, be warned: the slots for cards and money can only hold so much before the case will not be able to close.

This is not a suit for wearing if you are going to be swimming laps, surfing, water skiing, or any thing other than wading in. The bottom is tied on and the ties are not secure enough to keep it on if there is external pressure of the water against them. You will lose the bottom and possibly even the top.\n\nThe bottom is a small one. It is meant for smaller behinds, so if you have a bubble bottom, don't try this. It will not fit properly for full rear coverage. Think ultra low rise jeans.\n\nThe top is made so that it cradles breasts, but if you size it incorrectly, you will pop out of the cups. Think push up bra style. This will fit under a c-cup, but be cautious if you are over that. Just as with bras, not every style or model will fit every body. Properly sized, this adds a bit of cleavage without having half of the breast sitting on a shelf, just waiting to pop out if you decide to play volleyball. (On second thought, unless it is a racy game of volley ball, don't play in this suit unless you are an a/b cup.)\n\nThe material is soft and the suit is well made. There are no loose threads or obvious missed stitches. It should hold together great for at least this season's summer.\n\nIt arrived in a PVC bag that left the smell all through this suit. I had to wash it four times in lingerie detergent to get the odor out. There is no way I could even try it on before doing this, the smell was burning my nose. While the bag seems like a good idea, I won't buy or review another suit by Raintropical because of it.

I'll be honest, I generally get my sunglasses at the local discount store, but after getting these and seeing the quality difference I don't think I'll be able to go back to cheap glasses anymore.\n\nNot only do these glasses come in a really cool hard case, but they come with a soft little pouch too. I keep the case in my car and the pouch in my purse so if I forget to take the glasses off in my car, I can keep them scratch free in the pouch.\n\nThe pair I got are so cool! They are over sized black frames and they're really dark so they do a fantastic job of keeping the sun out of your eyes. I didn't realize when I bought these but they have glitter all over the temples and they're ridiculously pretty. I absolutely love these and they're very well-made. Theyre also super comfortable to wear. Im not normally a big fan of glasses that have metal temples as my hair always seems to snag on them, but this hasn't been an issue for me yet.  These are fantastic glasses!\n\nI received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.", "summary": "Love the glasses!

I am happy to report that it looked like the photos, without any defects: A beautiful bold blue statement necklace! So, I have decided to add another star to my review. However, my prior experience as noted below is a factual account of what actually happened to me, so I do not believe that it would be honest to delete this history or to change my initial review.\n\nUPDATE:\nThe RUILONG company contacted me and gave me a 37% refund on my purchase because of the defective stone in the fuchsia necklace that I decided to keep. The company has also assured me that if I purchase another necklace, the stones will not have any defects and will look as perfect as they do in the posted photos. I have added one star to my rating, due to excellent customer service. However, if I receive another defective necklace, I will update my review once more to accurately describe my experience.\n*******************\n\nOverall (without looking too closely) I really love this necklace. The stones are large and all of them are a bit different, making for a unique and striking statement necklace. The fuchsia color is bright and each stone varies in tonality.\n\nHowever, the big problem with this necklace is poor quality control. I had to order the fuchsia necklace 4 times before I received a necklace that did not have a major problem due to chips, large craters, and gaps in the thread because the stone was too small to fill the space. After the 4th order, I decided to keep the best of the 4 necklaces, which had a damaged stone close to the neck connector, which I decided to overlook because I don't think that it will be readily seen due to it's position.\n\nI also ordered the orange necklace, which had no problems due to damaged stones. However, the coloring of the stones was not a vibrant orange, as the photo shows. The \"orange\" coloring has a much more muted brownish tint. It's a nice color, just not the bright orange that I wanted. So, I ended up returning this necklace as well.\n\nWithout any quality control issues, this necklace would be worthy of 5 stars. But because of all the problems that I had in getting an undamaged necklace (and I still don't have a perfect one!)  I believe that it currently deserves just 2 stars. Too bad...because if these necklaces did not have quality control issues, they would be worthy of 5 stars!", "summary": "Poor Quality Control Ruins A Beautiful Statement Necklace", "unixReviewTime": 1491350400}

While they looked like a deep pink online, in real life the stones are a light pink and kind of dull, unlike the other stones.

The stones are also not in a setting, they are glued on the ring so they are likely to fall off.\n\nWith this all being said, I think the ring would be nice for a young  girl or woman.

My last pair gave up the ghost after years of wear, having served solid duty when I was 2 sizes larger than I am now -- they were some inexpensive pull on jean from WalMart (side note: I don't shop there anymore, boycotting Waltons' companies).\n\nThese ARE the jeans I was looking for! I decided that the price was right, but I wasn't sure about sizing, so I got one pair each, in Small and Medium. The Small fits suitably snug, but not cuts-off-circulation /overstuffed-sausage / look-at-that-old-lady-in-skintight-jeans snug. I *may* keep the Medium, for those days when I want to wear a pair of jeans that skim-while-slim. Haven't decided. But, I will DEFINITELY look for the same jeans, in a different color soon. Overall, I am very pleased with the fit; quality of workmanship; denim color and details (the \"frayed\" hem); and sale price. The jeans are the perfect pairing with tunic tops and my longer tees and tanks--and the fabric is a comfortable weight for even our 100-degree days here in Florida. Though I am petite (5'3\", 118#), the length works with both flats and heels.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Saferin-Women-s-Denim-Shaping-Curvy-Fit-Jeans-Legging-Blue-M/dp/B01DUBGLKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Saferin Women's Denim Shaping Curvy Fit Jeans Legging Blue M</a>", "summary": "The Valhalla of Skinny Jeans", "unixReviewTime": 1469232000}

Nothing is hanging out in the front or from behind either.  There is ample coverage all around while still looking cute.\n\nThere is a decorative tie in front for a bow and the shoulder straps are adjustable for different sized frames.

I hace a petite structure with a very endowed chest so I knew this might be an issue. And fully intended to just have the shirt tailored a bit to get a custom fit. What I didn't expect was the enormous arm hole and overly extended shoulder area. This combination creates. Situation where the shirt sits oddly across your back, think almost of a cowl but on your back and with a collared shirt. And when you extend your arms straight out or lift them up the shirt lifts well above your belly button.\nIt's a bummer!\nHowever, with all that said, I still really love the fabric and color so I am going to take it to my seamstress and see what magic she can work on it. I will either have it tailored so I can wear as it is meant to be worn (long sleeved button down, ideally) or I will ask her to convert it into a sleeveless button down for warmer weather.\nI will update my review after its been tailored, I am still holding out hope.\nI hope my review doesn't deter anyone away from the brand and collections because I do love all of my other peices- from dresses to sweaters to pullovers and short-sleeved tops I wear at least one an Allegra K peice basically weekly.", "summary": "3.5 stars", "unixReviewTime": 1467244800}

If your pants are tailored to fit you perfectly and you are looking for a belt that provides form over function, then this might be the belt for you.

It also looks amazing - I'm into really functional, clean looking design, and this ticks both boxes for me. So lightweight and so clean looking.\n\nThe only thing that might make me think twice about purchasing more is the price. I got mine for 25... I would say 35 bucks is OK the first time, but I could see this price keeping me away from buying additional colors. Don't get me wrong- their asking price as an introduction to the belt is well worth it- I just don't feel it's necessary to buy additional colors at this price to have around.

The choices are endless; fully customizable to fit style/personality/day. Each shoe can be controlled on its own! These shoes have quite a bright light that remains on (unlike most light-up shoes that only light while stepping) until turned off.\n\nThe mini USB charge port is located in a discrete pocket on the inside part of the shoe, within the strap. I've seen similar shoes here on Amazon with a huge black velcro pocket that didn't look esthetically  appealing. I've included pics from right out the box!\n\nI ordered with Prime and received in 2 days! So no shipping from China and having to wait 4 weeks. As for price, at $36 I would say is quite fair. Cheap Walmart/Payless shoes run at least $25 easy.\n\nMy son is soon to be 5 and wears shoe size US11.5/12. I ordered the US12 in Navy, and they fit perfectly right out of the box. I usually prefer to buys shoes a 1/2 size bigger for more wiggle room and room to grow, but since these shoes don't have laces to tighten, larger is not quite ideal.\n\nMy son loves them, so I was glad to please his desire for light-up shoes.

First paragraphs are my impression and description.)\n\nI really love this set of nose rings. I usually wear stud style nose rings but every now and then i like to change it up. Hoop nose rings, in my opinion, can really change up your look and style and can noticeably add to an outfit. They are a more noticeable, eye catching style, which will be noticed easier than small studs that tend to be more subtle. The open hoop style is one I prefer and I find them easier to wear. It leaves some open space in your nostril that I find far more comfortable for day to day wear. (TMI warning! LoL  They are WAY easier to deal with when you need to blow your nose! When I have a full hoop in my nose it can really hurt trying to blow my nose and having to maneuver it.)\n\nThis set of nose rings came in a handy little plastic box that can hold them safely for travel or storage. They were each individually wrapped in plastic sleeves before I opened them. There are five colors provided: silver, yellow/gold, black, a blue chrome finish, and a multi-colored chrome finish that reflects different colors in different light (it leans predominantly more green/yellow and resembles an oil slick appearance). The color selection includes all the basic colors for a wardrobe I could want. They are core colors that will match most of my jewelry and other accessories that I would add to a look. On top of having the go to colors of black, silver, and gold  they also include two REALLY fun ones for more funky moods and I LOVE the chrome finish on the blue nose ring as well as the REALLY COOL effect the oil-slick one has.\n\nPROS\n-Great price for a set of 5 nose rings. (~$2 for a nose ring is a great deal - Especially for a hoop in my buying experience!)\n-Comes with a durable handy plastic case for storage.\n-GREAT QUALITY for the PRICE! (I have worn the silver one for most of the month I have had these and it is still in GREAT condition.)\n-Sellers pictures accurately show how the rings will look.\n-SHINY clean finishes that have not dulled or discolored with time. (I have had these about a month and they still look new and as they were when I got them.)\n-GREAT VERSATILE color selection! (Includes all basic colors for most wardrobes/matching accessories.)\n-UNIQUE , VERY COOL, multi-chrome finish on one! (It really looks like an oil slick and I love the effect. It reflects different colors when caught in different light!)\n-Popular 20 gauge size that will fit most nose piercings. (My nose was irritated when I first got it in, but I adjusted and they were very comfortable to wear and fit well.)\n-Stainless Steel made and does not irritate my skin! (It was only irritated when I first put it in because I had tons of trouble getting it in there!)\n-It does not fall out or shift much. It stays put once it is in.\n-OPEN HOOP style that allows space inside the nostril and is more comfortable to wear than closed hoops that must be clicked shut. (Blowing your nose is so much easier with this style rather than closed hoops!)\n-When put in the nose the right way for the odd design of the hoop, the gap DOES NOT show and it looks like a closed hoop in the nose.\n-Appropriate size hoop that sits well in my nostril. (It doesnt look too big or too small for my nose and it fits well. I provided a picture showing it in for an idea on the size.)\n\nCONS\n- POOR DESIGN. They have to be put it from the INSIDE of the nostril going OUT! They are NOT EASY to get in! (I have never had to put a nose ring in from the INSIDE of the nostril going OUT so it was quite the ordeal getting the hoop in at first. I could NOT find the piercing on the inside of my nostril and irritated my piercing trying to get it in and there was some slight swelling afterwards. I cant complain for $2 a ring though and am still happy with this purchase  it is a CHALLENGE to get these in though so fair warning!!!)\n\nOverall, I am REALLY happy with this purchase. You really cant beat the price for what you get. The rings look to be high quality as well as feeling durable and sturdy. I have had these about a month and they still look brand new and have worn VERY WELL. The size of the hoop fits my face and is a good size. The set includes all the basic colors you could want and I LOVE that black is included! It is great having gold and silver for when you want to wear different jewelry but the black is my favorite because I have A LOT of black in my wardrobe and it goes with EVERYTHING! The blue and multi-chrome ones were just added bonuses for me and really great colors. I have blue eyes so I love that blue was part of the set. (Blue is a REALLY popular color anyway it seems, so I think it was a great choice.) They feel comfortable in and I don't even feel it there that I forget I have a hoop in sometimes. The gap cant be seen when it is put in but it allows more space in the nostril. The only complaint is the odd design. I didn't know there were nose rings that had to be put in from the INSIDE OF THE NOSE! LoL In order for the gap to be hidden in the nose and for the stopper or circle on the end of the hoop to be hidden, it has to be inside the nose. I just think it is so backwards. It was CRAZY HARD to get these suckers in at first and there were SEVERAL ATTEMPTS before I got them in. If you are up for the challenge and want to save money then they are WORTH it. If you don't want to deal with getting them in and performing what seems like some pseudo-surgery looking in a mirror up your nose feeling around like you're blind dodging nose hair, then DONT GET THESE! If you are one to change your nose rings A LOT, and want these hoops to specifically wear for SHORT TERM periods, I would say the hassle of getting them in IS NOT WORTH IT. Once I finally got mine in, my piercing was slightly swollen, and to go through all that just to try and put a different color hoop in the next day, it wouldnt be worth it to me. IF I was just putting the hoop in for a day and then switching to a stud I would be fine with it though! I received these at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. These opinions are my own and I was not swayed in any way.

Of course, seller should've mention properly, that the sizes are Asian. Make sure you order two sizes up. And its just a cheap costume for cosplay, of course, but seriously, if you don't expect a nice silk suit for 7$, than this is the cheapest but cute costume. For its purpose and price, it works amazing. The scarf is a very cheap material and bad stitching - almost like the ones they use for making cheap flags - but works for a costume. The fabric for the skirt and collar is quite pleasant and looks pretty. The skirt is short on the back, you'd need an under skirt to go out like that, but unless you bend it looks decent. The white stripes on the collar are cheap and too shiny, and the collar itself doesn't sit perfectly on your shoulders. The material of the shirt itself is a bit stretchy and see-through. Overall, it's a really cheaply made costume, but as a costume it actually looks great. The skirt looks very cute and its shape is very much like in anime. The shirt is flattering, especially if you have more Asian body type. It's a good cheap decision for a quick cosplay. Just make sure you choose the size correctly.

In California these are almost a necessity and I know that the first thing that I put on when I go out anywhere is a pair of sunglasses. Not only can the right pair of sunglasses save your eyes and make it so much easier to do anything outside but also it can make any outfit look great. I love how iconic these sunglasses look and how good they actually work.\n\n  FRAME: I love a pair of sunglasses that have a nice big frame to them. These are my favorite kind of sunglasses in those really bright days or any time I am at the beach where the sun is reflecting off the water. These frames are nice and big and keep my eyes nice and protected especially when I am near anything that it reflecting the sun. I love that the nose guard on these glasses is built into the frame because I am one that is always putting her glasses on top of her head. The nose guard being built in means that the glasses won't get stuck on my hair. The arms of the frames are nice and thin so therefore I still have full view of anything on the side of me. The gold color is great and just gives it that little bit of glamour. These glasses remind me of something that Audrey Hepburn would have worn. These are comfortable even when wearing them all day, which is great if you are like me and hardly take off your sunglasses.\n\n  LENS: I love that these lenses are not super dark, which for me is great especially when I am using them to drive. The tint of these glasses are perfect in my opinion. I like a pair of glasses that helps out when I am on a drive. These are light enough that they are still comfortable to wear indoors but still protect well against the sun. The tint of the lenses is black so the whole pair of glasses matches perfectly. I also love the fact that these lenses are so nice and secure. Even after dropping these a couple times the lens are still nice and secure in the frame.\n\n  OVERALL: These are great glasses. The look to these is rather iconic and still very modern. The size of the frame and lens makes is so that they are perfect in sunny weather. The color of the lens is a great shade and protects against the sun perfectly while still making you look great. These are made pretty strong and made well.\n\n  Ireceivedthis product for free in exchange for my true and unbiased opinion. The opinions expressed in this review are mine andmine alone.

The arms feel nice and sturdy and have a really cute design on the sides. They don't leave imprints on my temples either. It all comes in a really nice case made of faux leather (I believe) with a magnetic enclosure as well as a cleaning cloth and a keychain screwdriver.

As indicated on the box, it has UV protection lenses. The lenses are oversized, which is the main reason why I bought it. One thing which I think is very thoughtful is it also come with a tiny screwdrive for the sunglasses.\nCon's: The quality of the sunglasses was ok. It does feel premium. It definitely doesn't feel like a designer's sunglasses, more like night market quality.

I got this stylish with fast delivery thanks to my PRIME membership, love that.  So lets talk about the hat1  First, definite thumbs up.  For the price, this is a great value.  The material seems to be some kind of nylon blend or something, and you can tell that it will hold up well, far better than the straw types I have owned.  The item packaging was a tad disappointing, in that it came tightly packed in a small box.  While the hat definitely can be crunched, crushed, smashed, sat on, spilled on a and a host of other things I haven't managed to accidentally do to my hats and seems to handle them all just fine, the long exposure in the crumpled position in the box makes it memorize some bumps and wrinkles that are difficult to get smoothed out.  Nothing was broken or ruined, but instead of having the nice smooth look in the picture to the right, it has more of an irregular floppy look like many of the beach hats do where the brim kind of \"ripples\" around the hat rather than a front and back dip like the photo shows on the listing, and which attracted me to the hat in the first place.  However my hubby recommended trying to smooth it out more with a warm iron (not hot since plastic and nylon can melt) and I may post a follow up on that if anyone is interested.  That said, the hat itself seems well made for the money and fit pretty much as expected.  My head is in the small to medium range and it fit fine, but not tight.  There is a fabric sweat band around the inside which is very nice and missing on some of the overseas sourced hats I have bought in the past.  So plus there!  It also has a built in head strap for those windy days at the beach to keep it secure on your head instead of blowing away!  So another nice one there.  The overall construction is sturdy.  I did find a few hanging clear nylon threads which I show in one of the photos I think, but I clipped them off myself and gently toasted the ends to prevent any kind of slippage of the thread.  Again, something I see with most hats like this so its not unusual.  The seams are solid and the overall feel is a mid-weight level so the hat has some substance to it.  I love the look and the bold stripes and the colors are uniform and crisp with no variations or fades, etc. This is definitely a great buy and for going out shopping, to the beach, whatever its a nice fashion statement with a wide range of outfits.  it looks great with a sundress! I have a white one with black polkadots with matching pumps and this is just stunning with it creating an all white & black ensemble. Splash in some colors with accessories and WOW!

The 4 little hanging heart charms are very cute. The main decoration is a thicker double heart charm with a little hanging teardrop Cubic Zirconia crystal. The hearts also have little crystals on them. Very detailed and pretty. I like the way that little hanging crystal moves around as I walk. It is a very pretty and feminine ankle bracelet..\n\nThis is a long ankle bracelet. It is about 9.8 inches long with an added 1 more inch extender chain. So it hangs really low on my foot. Below the ankle bone. The clasp is a spring ring type clasp. This is made from Sterling Silver. I found the 925 stamp on the hang tag on the end, the tag near the clasp, and on the clasp. The chain is an OK thickness. It is not overly thin.\n\nBecause this ankle bracelet hangs so low it looks best with flat sandals or bare feet. You can make it smaller but then you would have to hook the clasp to the links on the chain which are kind of small. It does hook on but not really properly or all the way. Just the front pin part of the clasp. And then you would also end up with a much longer hanging chain. Just in case you were wondering....\n\nVery cute and well made ankle bracelet. Especially if you are into hearts. The long length and extra extender chain is great for people with wider ankles. It came in a nice gift box with a polishing cloth and a velvet pouch.\n\n*****DISCLOSURE: I received this item free of charge to evaluate and review. All opinions are my own.", "summary": "Very cute.

They have that vintage feel with the great polka dots and high waist.  I did purchase this at a discount in exchange for a review, but this price is totally worth it.  It is hard to find a bathing suit for this cost at all.\nSome of the reviews talk about lack of lining. Since the suit I purchased was blue, I didn't really pay attention to that. It is only going to be worn in private so I am only concerned about how well it fits.  This is actually the suit I grab first out the suits that I have. I feel comfortable and free with it.

I do not dry clean my baby clothes, as that is not in our budget and I do not have time to go to the dry cleaners to drop baby clothes off.....who does??...\nI did wash this outfit on Gentle Cycle and it turned out just fine.

I ordered the smallest size(70cm) which from the reviews was stated to fit 6-9 months which I would say is pretty accurate. I have a 1 month old who weighs almost 12lbs and was born at 10lbs 7 oz so he will probably get to wear this outfit around 4-5 months since he is a big boy lol. This outfit seems to be of great quality and very well made. I love that the pants have some stretch since I am cloth diapering which creates some bulk issues with pants fitting but since these stretch no issues there. I also love that this set is unisex making it great for gift giving. The material is also very soft and the colors are bright. Overall I am extremely satisfied with this set and would recommend to anyone who is looking for a cute outfit that is affordable and looks great!\n\n***Disclaimer: I have received this product at a discounted rate or for free in exchanged for my HONEST unbiased opinion/review.

I absolutely love my little man in it! Unfortunately, it won't fit him very long because it's already quite tight on him. I ordered the 70cm and he's 18 months old. He's about average for his size and is fitting in other 12-18 month clothing quite well. I'd suggest ordering larger sizes depending on what your child fits in. The material is really soft and the design is very cute! There is a cute little snap at the top of one of the shoulders to help get it on, so that it won't get stuck on their heads.  The only issue I have with it, other than it being smaller than planned, is that there were a lot of loose threads left on the garments and they weren't trimmed well after they were finished sewing the seams.  I had to go over it and trim everything off so that he wouldn't get snagged in them or pull on them and rip his clothes.  Other than those issues, I am very happy with the outfit.\n\nFull Disclosure: I was blessed to receive this item at a discounted price or for free in exchange for my testing, inspecting and reviewing it.

So, I can easily take that in for her so she can wear it up higher (rather than at her hips as shown in the photos).  Despite the sizing issues, this is a really well made skirt.  As stated before, it has elastic at the back of the waist. It also has a side zipper.  The length falls to about mid-calf on a 5'4\" person. The fabric is quite thick and sturdy with a texture to it. It is lined with a black lining fabric.  The lining only goes down about 10\".  So, it doesn't do a whole lot. I am posting a photo of this as well.  The seams are sewing well and the overall look is very cute!  My daughter loves it!", "summary": "Fits a size 2 to a size 8, well made and pretty!", "unixReviewTime": 1465171200}

Since I'm slightly bottom heavy, I need a dress that gives me some flexibility in the hip area. So, a flared skirt is perfect for me. In addition, details are important to me. The buttons and lacy Peter Pan collar definitely gives it a unique flair. And, remembering from Stacy and Clinton's \"What Not to Wear\", I notice that the dress is ideally divided into three segments- the top, waist, and the skirt. By dividing up these areas, it definitely will accentuate one's waist and gives it a fitted look.\nNow, with the size chart (within the pictures), I double-checked several times since the measurements are listed in cm. After converting it into inches, I made sure to pick my correct size. The 87cm for the bust size was a good fit since I'm a 34B.\nI did not have any smelly issues with the merchandise.

I bought these for an event where I would be wearing an evening gown and I loved that they were shape wear but still sexy in a throw-back 50s hollywood way. I was a little bummed because I didn't end up able to wear them with the dress as they came up too high (the dress was low back). This wasn't the fault of the products, just the way the cookie crumbled. Soooo if you're not sure if these will come up too far for the attire you're trying to wear, be advised that you can't roll them down. They have that reinforced vertical boning structure that corsets have in the back. This is GREAT because it means they won't roll down on you by mistake. And there's no boning in the front, which is also great because it makes the product nice and comfortable. The lace part at the bottom might potentially be a little snug, so if you have some extra junk in the trunk, I'd suggest going a size up so you don't have a visibly noticeable bump along your thighs.\n\nJust a disclaimer: the manufacturer has offered me another pair for a review, but that offer did not affect my review or opinion.

When I had the opportunity to purchase this pendant at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, I jumped at the chance and could not wait to receive this item. When I took this pendant out of the box I was completely impressed! The colors are vibrant and the addition of the gold colored ribbon that snakes through the different pieces of quartz in a nice touch.  There are different colors of Drusy quartz in this pendant including pink, purple, yellow and green. I have found that I can wear this pendant with many different outfits, and whatever color that particular outfit is, is the color that will pop from the pendant. I do have to say that the pictures of the pendant do not do it justice, and this is much more beautiful in person.  I am really happy with this selection and I expect to be able to wear this for a long time to come. You can tell that this pendant is made with care.

I thing its very cute all around.\nThe appearance of the length is a bit deceiving because it appears in the picture like it is a \"hi low\" style shirt, but it is not. It is more like a shark bite, which is long on the sides and shorter in the front and back, but it's not too short where its inappropriate for an older person. I think it will go really well as a casual outfit with jeans, capris, or shorts.\nI received this item at a discounted price for an honest product review.", "summary": "Very cute and casual shirt", "unixReviewTime": 1462924800}

Also the kind style of this cut normally doesn't make justice to chunky lady like me, I have tried another ones, but this one doesn't make me look like a football player on the top, the V neck is just great for my kind of shape and clears the neck so it looks very good. I am only 30 and don't want to be a soccer mom quite yet, so this is a perfect top. The image is true-to-color. The front is just a tad short, but not enough that I'd size up (if I raise my arms over my head, you can see about 1\" of midriff--that's all). The material is really lightweight and soft, though a little bit see-through. You can pretty easily see the outline of my bra cups, so if that really bothers you then wearing an undershirt is going to be necessary. Stitching on the neckline is uneven on my shirt, but I'm willing to live with that.\n\nIt is a little long, but as I am only 5'1, almost everything that I buy that isn't petite is going to be really long. I love the fit, you just need to watch the sizing.\n\nOnly complaint i have about this top is the sizing. You're not going to get the look in the picture because its not big enough no matter what size you order. If you weigh about 100-110lbs then you have a better chance. I normally wear a medium in tops. I ordered the xl and  the fit and look i got from that size was close to fitting right. It's slightly boxy looking and the sleeves don't drape they are fitted. It is longer in back, covers the butt completely. It's soft and the stitching is fine. This top overall is OK but would have been way better if the sizing was accurate. This is perfect for spring & summer. Also, since I did size up for the flowing fit the sleeves aren't tight.\n\nI got this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.", "summary": "I love this blouse", "unixReviewTime": 1461196800}

I must say however if you have a small bust size, and a very thin frame this shirt might fit as pictured. I ordered the XL thinking it would be really big and flowing, but its just not. I wear a 38DDD so my bust does take up a significant amount of the material. As far as the overall quality of the shirt, it is basic, and cheaply made. I think it would shrink terribly if dried in the dryer, and the stitching is slightly off in some spots. Basically you get what you pay for. It is a thin, kinda crummy shirt at a fairly cheap price.

I normally wear a medium shirt in everything and I ordered a medium. This shirt is loose on me, but not to where I can't wear it. Baggy is a good term for how the medium fit on me.\n\nThe quality on the construction is excellent. The seams are all stitched with a surged edge and then sewn down. The stitching is all tightly done and very well done too. I carefully examined all of the stitching and found no rips, tears, or fraying when it first arrived. Since I began to wear this shirt, I've had none of the stitching come loose either. The material is a higher end material than you see in most shirts as well. The material really flows and is light.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this shirt to anyone. The materials and craftsmanship are high quality. It looks wonderful on me.

Honestly, i do not know why he needs to get me a real expensive ring when i have this one. This ring is so beautiful, and matter of fact people thought it was real. I wore it out and the compliments that I got were amazing. I did happen to tell them that it is not real but where I got it from and how. The ring sparkles as if it were real, and when i washed my hands, i have kept the ring on and my finger has not turned green, or the ring didn't tarnish.

This ring is a great example of some great bling.\n\nIt has great sparkle which is always a plus.  There is one large oval stone in the center of the ring surrounded by 12 more cubic zirconia stones.  The band consists of three rows of cubic zirconia stones with 4 stones in each row.  They cascade about half way down the sides of the ring.  When you are wearing the ring you usually cant tell where they stop.  The center stones measure about  inch (centered) and the band about 5/16 inch (from tip to tip of stones).  The band is platinum plated.  The fit was perfect for me.  I wear a size 8 and thats what I ordered and it fit like a glove.\n\nIt looks well-made.  The prongs are tight and when I ran a piece of cloth and my finger over it there were no snags or sharp edges to get caught.  Included is a nice red box which is great if you plan on giving this ring as a gift.\n\nI received this ring free to use and evaluate for my unbiased and honest review.", "summary": "The Bling Ring!", "unixReviewTime": 1466985600}

It is MUCH smaller around the chest (\"Bust\" as they call it) than they have listed in their measurements. I can barely button up the shirt, and when I do, it is so tight that the shirt is unwearable. The sleeves were also a tiny bit long for me (I normally wear a 34-35 in sleeves), but that wouldn't have been a big deal if I could wear the shirt.\n\nThe quality of the shirt seems fine. Had the shirt fit OK, I would have been happy with the quality. In the pictures of this listing though, the buttons on the shirt are shown as black. The shirt I received has white buttons. If the shirt actually fit me and I could wear it, I would have been disappointed by this because I definitely would have preferred the black buttons.\n\nAnyway, I would proceed with caution if ordering this shirt. If you are normally a size US XL, I would stay away from it. If you are normally a size US L, this shirt will probably fit you around the front, but the shoulders and sleeves may be a bit long.\n\nI would return this shirt, but I would have to ship it back to China to get a refund of US$8 so it's just not worth it.", "summary": "Quality of shirt is fine, but don't believe the sizing measurements they have in the listing", "unixReviewTime": 1486771200}

The see-through chiffon over-layer goes almost all the way to the floor on me (just high enough not to trip on it, and I no longer wear much of a heel) and the chiffon skirt is pleated in the front for lots of extra room and makes it flow nicely.  There is an stretch knit under-layer that goes down to my knees.  So you cannot see anything above my knees, just below through the chiffon layer.\n\nI was so pleasantly surprised as how nice this looks on as well as the softness of the lace and the design of the flowy skirt.  I love it and can't wait to find an event to wear it to. I got the black one so it's a bit formal for me to wear to casual events. But I vacation and cruise a lot, and this will be perfect as it won't wrinkle in a suitcase.

The material of this dress is something I've never felt before. There are no tags either. Upon arrival it smelled horrible I was scared to even put it on my skin. It smelled of mold, like a strong chemical, i don't know what the odor was, but it was not good. Almost as if it had been sitting in an old wearhouse for years. I also recieved the wrong size. I emailed the sender immediately. They were the nicest most professional sender I have ever dealt with. They apologized. Explained that the item was shipped from overseas & was packaged to endure the travel, & they would send another item in the correct size. I was not charged for the replacement & not held responsible for returning the previous item. When the new one came in I was very pleased to say that the odor was no longer a part of this newer item, the fit was outrageously comfortable & I received compliments literally everywhere I went. I wore this dress on one of the hottest days in Chicago & the material kept my body breathing. It was worth the money paid. Also can be worn without the belt. Does not look exactly like the pic.

I tend to have to adjust hats down quite a lot, so I'm very happy with the adjustable velcro at the back. It's easy to get it sized just right; plus, if you're concerned about messing up your 'do you're all set because you can completely undo it and not have to pull it down over your head from the top.\n\nThe material seems to be good quality.

And when I say little I mean LITTLE!!! Two big eyes, one big mouth... And everything else is little. It's such a shame too because I really really like the print on this shirt.\n\nI should have known that this would happen when I read in the product information that the shirt has Asian sizing. I have limited experience with Asian sizing but this is the third shirt I haven't been comfortable in because they are just so small and the length is just too short! I'm 5'6\" and right now around 140lbs. I normally wear a medium in most things. I ordered a size 8, which one of the size charts says is an extra large, because of the warning about Asian sizing. I figured I would play it safe and buy two sizes up. And it's still too short. Just now its a little more wide than I'd like as well. In my opinion, it's about the length the average twelve year old girl would wear. It's not like belly shirt short or anything, just not as long as a regular tshirt. And certainly not as long as a US size extra large normally is!\n\nBesides the length of the shirt, it does seem to be of good quality. It seems well stitched and the material has some heft. The material is nice and feels like cotton but stretchy. I can't say I don't like it. It's just a little different is all. It does feel good against my skin. It feels like it would hold up well over time.\n\nSadly I would not purchase this shirt or any other clothes from this seller again. Well, at least not those with asian sizing. I think I've now learned to steer clear of that! I wouldn't recommend this to a friend either unless she was a petite woman.\n\n***I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for my HONEST and UNBIASED review. These words and opinions are 100% my own and I do not get paid. Nor do I change or remove negative reviews for sellers.

This would be something I would wear as a theme outfit and not often but only because of the skirt length. Plenty of people like this length and would wear whenever. This is just not my style. It is very pretty and comfortable to wear. I like the larger ribbon type on the waist and higher waist making me look smaller. I wear a 12/medium usually and this was just a little big but did shrink a little in the wash. Did not damage it just made it a little tighter which does loosen after wearing. Overall pretty dress.

I am 5'10\", and have a longer torso and arms. Because my arms are wider than most my size, my arm fills the sleeve completely, meaning it's breathable, but there is no extra room like on the model. The arm length is also about 2 inches too short. Compared to the model photo, the sleeves end on my right above the wrist.\n\nI'm self-conscious about my figure (and large arms) and try to either go for the nice \"flowy\" look, or an hour glass look. With the shorter, more fitted sleeves, and then having a lot of excess fabric for the stomach, I just felt I looked really boxy and wide versus \"flowy\" like the model. However, that may be more a problem with how I'm built versus the top itself. Again, if you are more evenly proportioned, you will probably like it if you follow your bust size on the sizing chart.\n\nIt is a thin material (there is a thin second layer for the torso so it's not see-through), so if you're self-conscious about your arms like myself, you can wear this in hot temps just fine. However, if you have larger arms for your size, you may feel funky in this top.
