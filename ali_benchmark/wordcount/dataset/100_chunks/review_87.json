I have used these sunglasses for a couple of times and these are some of the reasons why I think they deserve 5 stars:\n\n+ Extremely lightweight wooden arms.\n+ The shipping process was very quick and smooth. The box as easy to open, no knife needed.\n+They are unisex.\n+ The hinges are made of stainless steel, which means that it will last as much as you want, because it is anti-corrosive.\n+ The seller offers a 30 days warranty, meaning that if you did not like the sunglasses, just send it back and you'll receive your money.\n+ The sunglasses come inside a carry case, which is hard in the outside, but the inside is made of some kind of soft microfiber.\n+ The lens are polarized and offer 100% UVA/UVB protection, so your eyes will be protected from harmful rays.\n+ A cleaning cloth is included as well, so you can keep the lens clear without scratching while cleaning them with your hands.\n+ The arms are Woodies-labeled, and the inner part of the right one says \"See you at the beach\". Awesome detail Woodie USA!\n+ 19.90 USD is a fair price for such a cool sunglasses.\n\n>What's included?<\n- WOODIES Zebra Wood Clubmaster Sunglasses with Polarized Lenses\n- Cleaning cloth\n- Guitar pick\n- Sunglasses carry case\n- Woodies' cartoon (watch the attached video to know what I mean)\n- Woodie-labeled silicone bracelet\n\n>These sunglasses were provided to me as a free sample or with a discount for review purposes. Hope my review was helpful and answered some of your questions.<\nEnjoy the video!", "summary": "Lightweight and good-looking wooden sunglasses", "unixReviewTime": 1468540800}

It is cute and feminine but at the same time, professional looking. You can pair this top with different blazers, jackets, pants, and accessories, and come up with totally different styles and effects. That is probably what I like most about the blouse. I received this blouse for testing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased review after thorough evaluation and use.\n\nThe shirt itself is made of chiffon material and would be a great top for many occasions, both work and play. The material is not prone to wrinkling even after wash. The collar is round with a modest slit V. The blouse hugs your curves and then flares out at the bottom, which is quite appealing. The material is also slightly longer at the back. The cutest part of this blouse is the slightly puffed sleeves which give this blouse an additional feminine quality to it.\n\nThe design of the back of the top is okay, but Im a bit less excited about it. There is a modest hole in the back closed on the top by a single button. Im not sure I'm fond of this particular detail because it restricts your bra style choices. If you don't want people to get a peek of your bra from the back, you may have to wear a halter-style bra.  There is also a zipper than you can zip up, which I think is unnecessary since I can easily slide the whole blouse through without needing to unzip it. I think I would like it more if the back of the blouse were whole without the hole.\n\nThat being said, I still really like the style and versatility of the blouse overall despite the minor issues. The material is thin but completely opaque and is appropriate for every season and occasion. I found no loose threading or any kind of discrepancy with the sewing and quality of the blouse and the sizing seems to be true to size, though I did decide to order a size up because I prefer a looser fit blouse in general.", "summary": "Cute Chiffon Blouse with Slightly Puffed Sleeves and Flare", "unixReviewTime": 1468281600}

I recognize that a review of a free product is something fundamentally different from that of a product for which one has paid, but I do believe that such reviews can be useful when the process is respected and I've tried to do that here.\n\nAppearance: Plaid pattern with a slim fit. 3/4 sleeve with rolled up look highlighted by a button with faux nacre.  Plad pattern heavy on reds and blues but does have a gold that pops in the right light.  Shoulder pads give a squared off look at shoulder.\n\nBuild: Plaid pattern is consistent and sleeves and collar are symmetrical.  All buttons all functional and none of the stitching flaws that sometimes plague value priced clothing are present here. Material is a 75/25 Polyester/Cotton.\n\nFit: True to size for my wife. She finds the shirt has both a tactile comfort as well as a pleasing fit that allows full range of motion of the arms. The Poly/Cotton blend combined with the slim fit cut makes this a form flattering shirt narrowing at the lower torso then flaring out over the hips slightly.\n\nAnything else of note?:\n-At the posting of this review, the shirt is eligible for free shipping to members of Amazon Prime; always a plus in my book.\n-Free returns\n\nAny negatives?: Those unfamiliar with this style may feel the shirt could use one extra button. The lowest (5th) button lands right around the navel on my wife.\n\nBottom line: A well made and comfortable shirt with a form flattering slim fit.", "summary": "Well made and comfortable", "unixReviewTime": 1468627200}

The feel is wonderful and felt very expensive compared to other socks I've tried, overall I feel these are a very high quality and overall better brand.\n\nThe socks shipped using Prime and arrived in 2 days without any problems. They were packaged nicely without any damage to the socks.\n\nThe colors are nice and neutral. You receive three pair, one each of white, grey, and black. Even though they don't show much over the tennis shoes, I liked that the colors were not bright bringing attention to them. The shades work great with my shoes and my wardrobe.\n\nI received these at a discount for my review. I was moved to make the purchase not because of the discount, but because I have been on the lookout for some high quality socks to hike in.

They're comfortable and fit nicely. But they don't quite measure up, unfortunately.\n\nI confess that I have been wearing socks with \"nubbies\" on the bottom lately in an effort to walk \"barefoot\" around my house while keeping my toes warm, and I actually thought \"non slip\" was referencing not slipping on, say, hardwood floors. When they arrived and had no nubbies on the bottom, I realized that \"non slip\" referred to not slipping down into your shoes. Aha! That's *also* something I wanted. Unfortunately, the \"non slip\" thing happens only on first wearing. As soon as you put these in the washer and dryer, you're in trouble - welcome to Slip Town.\n\nThe first time I wore these socks, I tried them on in my house. No slipping, because they arrive with elastic that's quite strong. But I only tried them on for a bit before I thought, \"I should really wash these before I actually wear them.\" So I threw them in with the laundry and the next day, wore them with Converse Chuck Taylor All Star sneakers. Even before I left the house, they were sliding down to the middle of my foot. I had to reach into my shoe about seven hundred times while I was out shopping and running errands.\n\nHowever, these socks are *extremely* comfortable and kept my toes warm while I was having an MRI test. So I actually recommend that you use them for cozy times around the house, but wearing them with sneakers and hoping for \"non slip\" probably isn't the best option.\n\nPros:\n- Cute and comfortable.\n- Fit as expected.\n- Keep your toes warm.\n\nCons:\n- After the first wash, the elastic starts to wear out and they being \"slip\" instead of \"nonslip\"\n\nDisclosure: I received this product at a discount or at no charge for my honest review.

I wanted them to fit my newborn/infant daughter, obviously a child that young would not walk in those shoes but i wanted her to just wear them to match the outfits,  so thats not gonna happen for a while.

The smell is very artificial and honestly had i known they were made in china and would arrive weeks later from  (and i might be wrong on this) there iwouldnt have ordered them.

They really are cute, so im giving it 3 stars, but i would not put these on baby's\nbare feet without socks just because i feel there might be too many chemicals in this material that i might not know about.\nI received this product for a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.", "summary": "they are soft to touch and very adorable tiny moccasins", "unixReviewTime": 1469750400}

However I decided to keep them until they will fit her. The shoes are soft and flexible, perfect for around the house and the crib/pack n play. They are also very wide, good for wide feet. The openings on the tops will allow for air to get in so her feet won't get sweaty.\n\nFYI: I received this item at a discount or free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

I don't know how the product image looks on your monitor, but on mine it looks black. I rarely wear navy, so this is kind of important information for me. I really like the dress, but if I send it back, it will be for this reason. I took a couple pictures (with and without flash) to try to show a comparison but even then it's hard to tell. Just take my word for it. Navy.\n\nThe dress itself is very cute and well-made. The shirtdress cut is flattering, and the elastic at the waist is great for either emphasizing or creating curves. I would definitely say it runs small. I normally wear a size Large, ordered XL in this, and the dress fits but is tighter than I'd like across the bust. The skirt isn't too tight on my hips, though, which was a shocker considering my pear shape! So I'd say the skirt has a lot of leeway, and you should choose to go up at least one size but maybe two based on your bust. I'm a 36D and the buttons pulled pretty severely across the chest. I'll probably end up wearing it with just one or two buttons done up and show some cleavage for summer I guess! As for length, I'm 5'2\" and the dress hit a few inches above my knees.\n\nThe pattern is adorable, obviously, and looks the same in person as in the photos. The great thing is that from a distance it just looks like some kind of dot pattern. It's only up close that you realize it's cats! Yes! The fabric is both great and awful. It's light and drapey, almost silky, and I love that, but it also generates its own impressive static field. The dress isn't lined but you'll probably want to wear it either with a slip or leggings or it will cling horribly. You could also use Scotch Guard or a dryer sheet rubbed on the inside of the skirt.\n\nThe belt is fine considering the price, but it's pretty obviously cheap and there are no belt loops on the dress anyway. So I probably won't use the belt. But overall this dress is flattering, high quality and the print could not be cuter. An excellent summer purchase.\n\nI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.", "summary": "Navy, not black!", "unixReviewTime": 1467244800}

For reference, I generally wear an 18 in US sizing; I ordered this in a XXL and it fits just fine (also consistent with other ACEVOG dresses I own). The print is beautiful (I purchased the \"Rose Red\" version, which has a floral pattern that looks like cherry blossoms along with some lovely colorful birds), the scalloped neckline is a really nice detail, and the material is a mid-weight cotton blend with some stretch to it - it's a nice weight for wearing in the warmer months. The waistline is higher than it appears in the picture, at least on my dress. It's more of an empire waist, hitting just below the bust. This does not bother me, as empire waists are good for hiding a bit of tummy. My only issue is that the bottom hem is not straight across. At all. As a result, the sides of the dress are significantly and noticeably shorter than the front and back of the dress, on the order of a couple inches. I have not had this issue with an ACEVOG dress before. (I've actually never had this issue with ANY dress before, and I own an embarrassing number of dresses from a variety of brands.) I will probably still keep the dress, as it's not something most people will notice at first glance, but it does bother me. I may try to fix the hem myself, but I'm not much of a seamstress.\n\nEdited to Add: It appears, at least based on the pictures the other reviewers have posted, that there may be an issue with the pattern for this dress - none of them mention it; however, their dresses seem to have the same issue with the front of the skirt being longer than the sides. (Which is actually the opposite of what you'd expect - normally the fabric would stretch where it was cut on the bias, which is usually at the side seams, not the front and back.) I ended up returning the dress. The discrepancy was too noticeable and really bothered me.", "summary": "Pretty, decent quality dress for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1467331200}

Order on June 22nd and received this swimsuit today. A very cute swimsuit and concept. The colors are vivid and nice on the bottoms and built in bra top. The material is very silky. The entire suit fits okay, but the seams around the front of the armpits seams a little loose. I think these need to have some elastic added to them so they can shape to different body types. The bottoms fit very well. They are a full coverage bikini bottom that almost go up my belly button. The black drapey panel is loose ( I think it should be a little less material so it's no so bulky looking) and the fabric flows enough to hide and stomach issues. The back is really cute and strappy with an adjustable strap that can help the suit to better fit on top.  The bra area does not have an underwire. It does however have a some light elastic banding and built in cups. Overall I would say this is nice modest swimsuit that can help conceal any mid section flaws while keeping it cute. The quality of the fabric is soft but it is definitely lacking in elastic bands in the fitted seams on the top. I usually wear a large (I'm a 10-12 in American sizes) and I read other reviews along with taking my measurements and decided to go up to the X-Large. A very wise choice! I purchased this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. I am an avid Amazon shopper and understand the importance of honesty in reviewing.

I bought this bathing suit for my daughter.  She really liked the look of it, and liked that it had a nice loose top, that would help cover the part of her body she is most self-conscious about.\n\nI used other people's recommendations in choosing the size.  Normally my daughter wears a size 6/8.  She has a DD chest size.  I ended up ordering an XXL - it was a chance, but since it was such a good price, we were willing to take the chance.  She wants to wear it to an up-coming music festival.  My daughter was looking for a bathing suit that was modest, yet looked good, too.\n\nThe bottoms in XXL were a good fit for her size 6/8.  They went from just below her belly button to her upper thighs.  They are a very cute boy short.  The top is like wearing a bra top with a wide armed tank top over it.  The XXL covered her DD chest comfortably - she has a little cleavage showing, but not a lot.  The long tank top covers / conceals her tummy, which is what she is sensitive about.\n\nMy daughter says it is very comfortable, and looks forward to wearing it to the festival.  The colors look just like you see in the picture - she got the blue one with polka-dots.\n\nPlease keep the sizing in mind as you order!", "summary": "Runs very small, but looks great on!

I have a few of Woolly Clothing Co men's merino wool shirts (the 190gsm kind), and the zippered hoodies. Compared to those, this shirt is considerably softer!\n\nThis has become my favorite wool shirt to wear, because it is incredibly soft. I have fibromyalgia, and sometimes my skin is extremely sensitive; I was able to wear this shirt even during this latest \"flare,\" which was stunning to me and for which I am extremely grateful. I have hypothyroidism, as well, so most of the time I run \"cooler\" than most (okay, I get cold and turn purple, all right?), and wool has been a sort of rescue in helping me to regulate my body heat better. This particular shirt is so amazingly soft, I hardly even notice I'm wearing it! That is a rarity!\n\nThe blue color is a very nice shade, and compliments my skin tone; it's a vivid shade, without being glaring. I have washed this shirt maybe 3 times (upon receiving and twice after that) in my HE front load washer (using Euclan wash, no rinse soap) and I hang it to dry. It dries very quickly and is ready to go, even in cooler room temperatures (there's snow outside and it's been at or below freeze for a couple of weeks).\n\nI seriously LOVE this shirt, and am please with the quality of clothing that I have purchased from Woolly Clothing Company. I definitely recommend this shirt to men AND women, as it's not overly baggy, nor is it \"form fitting.\" It is a good balance in fit and in fabric.

I'm not modest but even I will probably have to put a few stitches in the front layers that wrap around to form the \"slit.\" Otherwise it unwraps itself and rides up a bit which is an issue since the very shortest part is right in the front and center. Great for the price!", "summary": "I love this dress", "unixReviewTime": 1481846400}

I literally got it just today, took it out of the package and inspected it, and right off the bat saw threads going everywhere and tears in the fabric.

If you love scarves, like I do, then you will be greatly bothered by the quality of this one.  Day ONE of having it and it is literally falling apart.

The fit is spot on and flattering for the most part. I am not a fan of tank tops or spaghetti straps because the chub that I have around my shoulders and underarms tends to show. This is a very nice compromise. Not a full short sleeve because my underarm is open as it would be in a tank. So it is refreshing because I can keep cooler when in the sun but not feel self conscious. However the arm hole is a bit big for me, and so you are able to see my bra when I raise my arm. This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. Otherwise I am in love with this shirt and wear it often! It is a great piece to wear whenever and can be dressed up or dressed down. Plus the color is gorgeous. Oh one more thing, oftentimes soft smooth shirts like this are see through so you can see your bra or even your belly button. That is not the case with this shirt.

These men's boxer briefs are extremely comfortable and the waistband is exceptionally smooth on contact with no pinching in the waist. There are a few concerns for those who have larger thighs than average. I train legs twice a week but my legs are not extremely thick and these DO ride up due to my leg circumference. I usually walk a few miles a day and they ride up within half a mile or so making them uncomfortable to walk in. Overall, I do like the material and initial feel but if you have larger thighs than normal, i.e. trains legs and such, then these boxer briefs are probably not for you.\n\nPros: Comfortable to wear when relaxing all day.\n  Fantastic comfort on the elastic waistband\n  Give the extra room need with the 'pouch'\n\nCons: They ride up if you have bigger thighs due to weight training\n  The care/information tag ran completely off after one wash. Previous briefs faded after a year or so.\n  They pinch a lot when they ride up and make it uncomfortable for those long walks\n\nOverall, these boxer briefs are great for most but do not make the mistake of buying them if you are a lifter or mountain biker like myself with muscular thighs. Maybe if the length was extended slightly it would work as intended but I am no expert in that field. I would submit a photo of my embarrassing circumstance when they ride up but we have all been there at one time or another and doubt you'd like to see it.

I got her a 5t and she probably would have been OK w the 4t but the shirt is long and she has a long torso. The waist of the shorts was a tiny tiny bit loose but again, she's between sizes.

USING THE CHART THAT IS LISTED.****\n\nSummary  I am giving this 5 stars HOWEVER only because I was able to give this to my wifes mom who was able to fit it combined with the quality and findings after it was tried on and used.\n\nSizing - If you look in the drop down menu under label size and see 2X, the size next to it shows US 10-12. On the size chart, this shows the size is actually US 18-20. I was able to confirm that if you are in the US, the true size is the one in the drop down.\nNow about the Swim Suit\n\nThis is a very nice swimsuit for the very low price it is being sold for. Typical swimsuits are typically upwards of $30-60+ and this one is the same if not better quality that the other types we have paid much more for.\n\nMy wife (and ironically her mother) do not like revealing types of clothes and they both really enjoyed the way this one was designed. The design is very attractive, modest and while vintage in nature, was a modern design. The upper portion of the suit has a built in underwire bra (padded breast area), has an overlay designed front and crossing straps in the rear. This bottom of the suit is free flowing and covers a pant legs-type of bottom.\n\nMaterial is quite stretchy and the stitching is both tight and even. When worn by my wifes mother, she was happy to have the pant legs vs. a simple crotch design. In terms of the breast area  padded cups, she did verify this suit was in fact designed for a larger size of breast closest if not larger than a D. It is certainly able to be used with a smaller cup, however, it was a slightly looser fit in that area.\n\nI don't know about you, but I depend very heavily on reviews that are posted on Amazon. I also read what reviewers on Amazon have to say. I want to help others by providing my reviews that detail the product as well as the experience I have with the products that I get on Amazon.\n\nPlease note I have no relationship with this seller. I did receive this free in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.  I take my reviews serious and will only provide my true feedback.

I am normally a size 0 or 2 and I ordered the small of this dress. It came in multiple envelopes and I was surprised that it was not wrinkled. It is made out of 88% polyester and 12%spandex. This dress says to hand wash only which is not very convenient. When I was wearing the dress for pictures I did not have the right bra on and needed a strapless and backless bra--probably one of those stick on kinds. The collar is very high and the back has one hole near the top and a second hole which is open-back. There are two large slits on either side of the bottom of the dress. The dress is a little long for me (I'm 5'1) but looks nicer with really tall heels. The material is cool to the touch and almost feels similar to wicking material used in workout clothes. My biggest problem with this dress is that it not having somewhere to wear this cool dress. It did have some fraying in the seams of the dress where the side panels split for the legs. Not all of the sides of the dress are sewn and I am worried that it will continue to fray. It would be nicer if it was machine washable too.\n\nI received this Ninimour Women's Sleeveless Aztec Print Dress at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.

Luckily I have been losing weight and am hoping to lose enough in the next month to be able to wear it comfortably on a cruise I am going on in mid August. Based on the measurements it should have fit fine. In a way for me it might be good because it may have been too big by my vacation if I continued to lose the weight the way I am losing it. It is form fitting and looks really good on, or at least I know it will later. I love the cut out design in the chest area. It is made of a thinner stretchy material which is great for those hot summer nights when you want to get dressed up to go out but want something cool to wear.

The other SEAL line uses the Ronda 515 zero jewel movement.  Although it says it's a 44mm watch case, it feels smaller than that. Maybe because of the refined lugs on the case. The mineral crystal is slightly recessed below the bezel, protecting the crystal. An improvement from the other SEAL line.\n\nOver a month of ownership. I've worn it nearly continuously for a month. Still great condition. Only 1 second off in that month. Great durable watch and great great price. I wear the watch 24/7 even while sleeping.

I've just sent two Traser Code Greens back to a different vendor, as both had loose and spinning hour and minute hands upon opening.  I've read similar anecdotes about the Luminox brand as well.  Yet, I thought I'd try my hand one more time with another MB-Microtec factory variant.  This time, I am absolutely delighted!  Unlike the Traser, this watch is SUBSTANTIAL.  It has just the right bit of heft to let you know this isn't a plastic toy; yet it's light enough to let you forget you're wearing it.  It's the perfect size for my 7 inch wrist.  The dial face itself is quite large; very legible.  Just now, the tritium was visible to me in the low light of my bedroom hallway.  I turned off the lights, and could readily see the tritium.  I'm sure it'll be quite bright once my eyes adjust.  Further, the crystal seems to have an anti-reflective/glare coating. The reasons I chose this watch over the 3050 series are thus:  Green tritium with orange 12 o'clock tritium, \"multi-jewel movement\"....it stands to reason this would be a Ronda 715 or better, standard 22mm size lugs (easier to find nato straps, as opposed to 23mm), and the fact that the calendar dial has a black background rather than the usual white, which I think blends better.  And at this price, the watch is an exceptional value!  The watch came with the correct packaging, all tags, and even a warranty card.  I don't think I could be much happier!

I suppose it would be a great maternity shirt if I were pregnant, but I'm not so it is just too big.

The skirt is definitely not as full as pictured, so if you want some fullness then you will need to wear a petticoat underneath.

Why not five stars then? Well...\n\nUpon arrival, I tried to gently lift the earrings out of their presentation box, and one of the earrings pulled right off of its post. The adhesive material (lets call it glue) that attached the pearl to the post was gooey and wet, and got all over my fingertips. I did not pull hard; the thing just popped off, like it had been packed before being allowed to dry or maybe the glue was old...?\n\nSo then, why not one star?\n\nBecause I was able to wipe off the gooey residue so that you can't even tell it was there, and then used one drop of Loctite Super Glue that we had in the house to put the earring back together. Just a quick drop on the post, then I pushed them together. You can't see the glue at all, and I let the set sit for two days before trying to put them on.\n\nPresto. Problem solved, as long as the Loctite Super Glue doesn't breakdown the pearl over time (will come back and update the review if it does).\n\nBottom-line: We had a little glitch that was solved fairly easily. These earrings look great and are very comfortable to wear. Since other reviewers do not seem to have experienced the same issue that I did, my loose earring issues seems to be a fluke that we solved with a dab of Loctite Super glue... though I could have returned for a replacement pair.  Based on how they look and feel right now, I would recommend giving this set a try if you seek a pair of earrings of this construction, size and price.\n\nRecommended\n\nGo for it.\n\nWe received this item gratis from the manufacturer or one of the sellers, without obligation, and decided to objectively test and review it.

I sometimes wear these alone, sometimes with very tiny CZs or other really small loops or posts. I don't want to take away from the simple beauty of the pearl.\n\nThese earrings lock well and I haven't felt that they were loose or unstable in my ears. I am very happy with them. They're the type of earring every woman should own and wear even if it is with jeans and a T.\n\nI received these earrings are a reduced price or free (Forgot which. It has been a while.

These are 100% real, AAA Quality Cultured and have silver studs. Both the posts and the earing backings are marked 925, although the print on the stud is very hard to see as it is small. What I like about these is they are more of a classy and elegant type of earring. They are a simple type of design and yet they bring a lot of focus to the ears when worn. You will also get an extra set of silver backing as well which was a nice add in. The backings are nice and snug and the post has an indent as a way to prevent the backs from sliding off. In terms of quality, these are very nice. Unlike fake pearls, these have a nice luster to them when light hits them as well as a visual overtone. My wife has already received comment as to how nice they look when worn to church and guess the only thing I need to do now is make sure the next item I get is a matching pearl necklace. Oh and they come in a nice blue display box. So no need to shop for a presentation box for these if you are gifting.\n\nAs with all my reviews, should these have any issues with ongoing use, I will update this review .\n\nI don't know about you, but I depend very heavily on reviews that are posted on Amazon. I also read what reviewers on Amazon have to say. I want to help others by providing my reviews that detail the product as well as the experience I have with the products that I get on Amazon.\n\nPlease note I have no relationship with this seller.

Two zipper pockets on the back, and one more open pocket behind the wallet front flap. Seriously. I can't imagine what anyone would use all that space for, but I love having it!! Means I can go without a purse if I needed. I've had it for a month and wanted to see how it held up before reviewing it.

I do not work for them, nor am I obligated to say these nice things, I am giving it those stars on merit alone. I have been eyeing this wristlet on amazon and ebay from several different sellers and when I saw it at a discount I was super excited, I am a ridiculous cheapskate.  Anyway,  when I received it , it was packaged quite well. In a padded envelope,  in a plastic wrapper, inside a branded pouch . There were no folds, bends or scratches on it at all. It is just like it looks in the pictures.  Maybe even better. The material is soft, the zippers are shiny and pretty and above all else, all the zippers work nicely and do not stick.it has two zipper parts on the back and on the inside there is a zipper part that allows you storage behind all the card slots, and I have never seen a wallet with that feature before.  The strap is sturdy and big enough to fit around my fist, but small enough to stay put and not fall off. The lining is nice,  well sown and will not get out of place or get caught in the zippers. It does have a plastic smell, I left it open for an hour and it is almost gone. Everything has a smell, so it isn't a deal breaker. The color is nice, and it has a ton of storage for all of those friggin loyalty cards stores push on us to track our purchases so they can do the targeted advertising crap.

I am almost 50 tall and weigh 109 lbs and it fits perfectly.  It does need a small hem (depending on preference).  The material is so soft on your skin (almost like a very soft T-shirt).  It has a scoop neck and an empire waist giving pleats and falls so nicely at the bottom with quarter sleeves.  This is an all-season dress and is so versatile.  You can dress it up or down with heels and jewelry or some sandals and a belt.  It can be worn for casual events or to semi-formal events like parties, church etc.  So many ways to wear this super comfortable dress.  It comes in black, navy and red.  I love the fact that the dress doesnt cling when you walk.  It can be worn in warmer weather and not get overheated or cooler weather with a sweater or cardigan.  You are bound to get compliments when walking into the room wearing this dress. The one thing I would recommend is when ironing the dress, use a really low setting and use and ironing cloth.  Otherwise, I highly recommend this dress.  I think this dress would flatter any figure/\nAlthough I received this product at a discounted rate for my review, my opinions are truthful and honest as I buy many products myself based on product reviews and would not deceive buyers in any way with my own personal product reviews.  Hope this review helps and happy shopping.", "summary": "The material is so soft on your skin (almost like a very soft T-shirt)", "unixReviewTime": 1466208000}

I ordered this suit in a size US10/44, and it fits very well. I typically wear a US size 6-8, but am long-waisted, and I don't think a smaller size would have fit me. The colors in this suit are exactly what I expected based on the pictures in the product listing. I really like the neon pink--I had thought it might be too harsh against my pale skin, but its just fine.\n\nThis suit does have underwire, so it has really good support. The underwires are sewn in well and don't jab at me at all. The skirt is a good length (covers my rear end, but isn't super long either) and flows nicely. I REALLY like the straps on this suit because they are wide and don't dig into my shoulders. I also like that they go over my shoulders (like a bra) rather than around my neck. The hems and seams are done well, with surging in the appropriate places. There was one place with an extra piece of threading after the hem was surged, but it was easily snipped off without any raveling. The bottoms of the suit are like bicycle shorts, but they aren't as long as some of the other swimsuits I have tried, which makes them more comfortable. The torso is fully lined and the fabric is light and flowy.\n\nThe style of this suit is very similar to another one of the same brand that I adore. This one might have a teeny bit less support in the bosom, but I still really like it. I feel confident, modest, and secure while wearing it, and I would definitely wear this one in public.\n\nI purchased this swimsuit at a discount in exchange for my honest review. I did not receive any other compensation, and I am not obligated to write a favorable review. I have used this product myself, and all words in this review are my own.", "summary": "So cute!

The top is so baggy that even the \"bikini\" top part under the tank doesn't come close to fitting & the bottoms are so small I could hardly get them on.\n\nIf the sizing were proportionate, I would re-order this suit in a heartbeat to get the correct size, but as it stands I would probably need a large in the top & a 5XL in the bottoms to get a proper fit.  Since it's not possible to order each piece in a different size & I'm not paying for 2 suits just to take the top from one & bottoms from the other, I'll regrettably be returning this suit.", "summary": "Sizing is WAY off!", "unixReviewTime": 1490227200}

So I ordered what was advertised as men's size L. At that time, the ad did not read China L or US S. I received a garment that was labeled L. When layed flat on a table top, it's dimensions are as follows:\n\nUnstretched waist: 13 1/4\" across (therefore 26 1/2\")\nStretched waist:18\" across (therefore 36\")\nInseam: 28 1/2\"\nOverall length from top of waist to bottom of leg: 38\"\n\nMy waist measures 35\" at the navel.

I am height 6'0\" and have an athletic build; only about 16% body fat.\n\nThese pants, although expandable to a waist 36\" fit me ridiculously tight; This is due to the skinny fit around the upper and lower legs, and especially over the buttox. My wife joked that it was so tight on me that it looked like something that a gay person might wear :-)  So I'm donating them to Goodwill.\n\nApart from the sizing issue, it is actually VERY WELL MADE. The bottom of the legs have brass zipper closures to enable the bottoms to open for getting the pants on/off, and then to close for a snug fit where its needed at the bottom for bike riding. Excellent design and construction for mountain biking! I just needed one size larger than was advertised and labeled, that's all.

I was actually surprised it was bigger than I had anticipated. My measurements are 36C-29-36 so I guess I could have went with a large instead. I'm just so use to clothing from China running smaller. The lace on it is sewn pretty well I was checking it out and looked like they used a thicker thread or something and then the rest of it was done in interlock. The material itself is a thin stretchy spandex and feels really soft. The decal looks like it will hold up through washing too but, since the shirt is big on me I will probably be giving it to my friend and she will have to report back to me on how it holds up. I did receive it as a complementary sample in exchange for my review. Thanks and have a great day! ~Kiki", "summary": "THESE SHIRTS MUST ACTUALLY RUN TRUE TO SIZE", "unixReviewTime": 1469836800}

They're still extremely cute, and my daughter loves them (though her favorite part was chewing on them after we opened them, not wearing them).\n\nI ordered the largest size and they're already going to be too small for her soon unfortunately, but that's just because she hit a growth spurt since the last time I bought her shoes and didn't realize her size was different. The shoes were true to size and they're an average width. If your baby has bigger feet (wider or thicker height) these aren't going to work.

I am 64, 5'7\", 185 lbs, 46 bust, 46 hips. Retired with health issues. These dresses are wonderful! I have bought a few other dresses shown with this style too. This style in 1XL fits me perfect!, just covers knees, covers the shoulders, great neckline, arm holes don't grip me, one hidden pocket in the right seam and enough fabric sized for movement. I bought sizes XL too. The XL is tight around the hips, when I bend it feels tight, the length is above the knee. It looks like I am smaller with less fabric in XL but isn't so comfortable. Laundry is a breeze. Fabric feels like it is starched. There will be a lot of wear for these dresses. Sewing is very nice. Not the sewing that has one thread that pulls out until It is an apron.

They are \"somewhat short\" with the patterned top only coming up a little higher than mid-thigh. Which means the bottom of the patterned area is only 4 or 5 inches above the knee.

Keeling", "reviewText": "I don't really consider myself a collector of hats, but I do have a LOT of hats that I've gathered through the years. I was very pleased when this one arrived. I didn't even have to take it out of the plastic bag to tell this one was a quality item. Just by the weight alone you can tell this is very well made. The stitching is very tight with no loose threads. The acrylic material is very heavy duty and thick. I really like the hats that have the adjustable buckles on the back instead of plastic snaps or the ones made with Velcro. The adjustable buckle adds even more quality to an already great product. Everything else aside, the greatest feature about this hat is the logo. It is done with quality stitching and not something that is just heat applied. The letters really stand out. They are crisp, white and perfectly aligned. I'm not familiar with this company, but if all of their products are of this quality I will certainly be doing more business with them in the near future. If I could give it 6 stars I would.\nI received this item at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review, and, as with all such review items, I used it long enough to get a feel for how good, bad or mediocre it is. If it seems that I only give 4 or 5 stars on my reviews it's because I tend to review only the 4-5 star items, which is why my reviews of samples tend to lean a little higher. I will often use a product for a number of weeks or a month, in order to learn its operation and get a feel of its longevity. I'm always open to questions in the comments section about it. I take pride in my reviewing process and hope it helps one in making a decision. I tend to choose to review products that I actually want and that I will use on a daily basis so that I can provide a thorough and honest feedback on the product. If this review has been of any help in decision making, please vote YES below. Thanks for your time.", "summary": "SUPER!", "unixReviewTime": 1467590400}

It even has a replacement rhinestone in case I lose one. The inside is completely lined in a really nice fabric, and there are plenty of pockets inside and out for all my stuff.  Also, the conceal carry pocket is large enough for my M&P9c 9mm with room for a slightly larger firearm. This bag is very well made and I can already tell that it's going to hold up well.

The streaky pink and wood appearance is eye-catching and unique. The watch comes with its battery installed and a little tab to pull before you set it and start it working.  It keeps good time.\n\nThere is a film disk over the face of the watch to protect it. If you don't know it's there, it's easy to miss it and makes the watch face appear less clear. Once this is removed, the face is clear and unscratched. There is a design on the face of the watch that is kind of hard to discern, and hash marks that indicate minutes around the perimeter of the watch face. I believe it is a bamboo design, which makes sense since the watch is made of bamboo. I would prefer it if the design and the hash marks were a bit darker and easier to make out.\n\nThe watch band is long for me and I will need to take it to my jeweler to adjust it before I can wear it. The closure, the hands, and the time-setting adjuster are all black plastic. To me, the black plastic cheapens the look of the watch a bit. My watch band also has some rough edges on some of the bamboo pieces, which I will need to sand down or live with. While this watch is different, it is similar to many wooden watches I've seen on the market lately, and the price point of this watch at the time of this review seems on the high side to me.\n\nI received the bamboo watch at a discount in return for my honest review. My reviews are done in compliance with Amazon's TOS and FTC regulations, and I never guarantee a favorable review.

In the past I had worn princess cut diamond studs from Helzberg but I lost one and kept the other in my jewelry box for years. When these new diamond studs from Amazon arrived, I opened my jewelry box to compare size and quality. Size wise these new diamond earrings from Amazon are about the same as my old stud earring from Helzberg (although the shape is different). Color and clarity wise, these new earrings from Amazon blow the old diamond out of the water! I've never worn screwbacks before, and I rarely wear earrings, so it took me about 10 minutes to gently push them through my ears. One of the backs was bent, but that wasn't a dealbreaker so I decided to keep them. I have included a photo of the new studs on my ears and also a side-by-side photo comparing my low quality mall diamonds to the new sparkly ones from Amazon. The difference is pretty amazing, and the price was about the same (though I bought the mall studs about 10 years ago, so they'd probably cost more now).

I received it and opened it up and found that the ring was an adjustable one, in adjusting it to fit my finger the silk rose came unglued from the top and now I have to try to remove the large glob of what appears to be a glue stick and try to glue the rose back to the ring. The ring itself is smaller, I wear an 7.5-8 ring and it pinches my finger unless it's opened up too wide to be comfortable and fit properly. The bracelet part is made for small wrists and fits my 7 year old better than it does me. The entire bracelet and ring fit her better than they do on me and I have a small bone structure, so my wrists are not large. I don't feel that this would hold up to wear & tear at all, maybe to be worn for very short occasions if it was reinforced with glue before wearing it (or if yours is already glued well). I am still providing 3 stars because I think for a very small boned woman it would be a nice wear for a costume party or as costume jewelry. The beading is delicate and the lace is exceptionally feminine.\n\nDisclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

Down to the ring is metal vines with black plastic beads attached. Then on the bottom is a brass looking adjustable ring with a rose made of satin material. The satin fabric is concerning because it will not hold up well over a long period of time. This is not a waterproof accessory and would get damaged easily when washing hands. After hooking the chain closed on my wrist there was quit a bit of chain sill dangling down, long and I would have to use it on my less dominant hand so it would not dangle into my food.

I would normally never buy a pair of sunglasses without trying them on first, but for $15 I figured it was worth a shot - especially since they're polarized.

I decided to put them away and try them once I gave birth and needed to breast feed. Fast forward a month ago I try them on again since i need breastfeeding bras and still bra is uncomfortable especially now since my breasts are even more sensitive.\n So these bras give no support. You can put the straps up high and the bra just starts to sag down. Now If your breasts are heavy obviously they will sag with the bra and thus making them useless. Also I do not have huge breasts, i would say they are average size and the XL size did not support or even cover my breast well. I still wear these once in awhile when I go out just because i need a bra that i can use to breast feed until i can find ones that work well and feel comfortable but besides that they're just taking up space.

The fabric and stitching are well-done, nothing loose or out-of-place.

There are 8 card slots instead of 12 (and I can confirm that they're a little tight, as others have mentioned), and there is no clear view slot (not a big deal for me, though I admit I would've liked a clear view slot to showcase photos). Also, the two center-most pocket divisions are not sewn into the bottom of the wallet, so there's a small gap beneath them. I don't have any huge issue with this, but it's worth noting.\n\nConclusively, it's a well-made wallet. Haven't taken it out to test durability or anything (I'm a student with a heavy bag and a testy route around school, so we'll see), but it seems as if it'll hold up, as there aren't any loose threads or stitchings that might pose a problem.

At this price point I was a bit skeptical of the quality and frankly did not expect it to be comfortable at all.\nI was quite impressed when I opened the package and saw the quality of the material. The main material of this babydoll dress is a nice black sheer mesh material trimmed in satin ribbon and the top is a very pretty flowery designed black lace. The g-string is exactly what you would expect from this type of product. It is simply a triangle of the same sheer material and a couple of pieces of elastic. This portion is really not all that comfortable, but who would expect it to be? Honestly, I usually disregard the g-string and wear a pair of lace boyshorts.\nI am 5'6\" tall and weigh 168lbs and normally wear a 36DD. I ordered a size extra large according to the size chart and in order to avoid looking like a beached whale caught in a fishnet. If anything I could have gotten a size smaller. The lace kind of gathers in the cups and the skirt part is loose and flowing.\nThe shoulder straps are elastic and slide adjustable so you have a lot of leeway to adjust the sizing. It is very comfortable and seems to be of excellent quality. I am very happy with this little nighty and I know my husband will love it too.\nI received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Cute and comfy", "unixReviewTime": 1467936000}

It fits comfortably, and isn't too tight or loose.  Just right.  So based on my experience, I would say the size chart is accurate, and order your normal size.\n\nThe look of this dress is fun and stylish.  It features short sleeves, and navy blue and off white chevron patterns throughout the dress. This color combination is really cute and attractive.  The length of the dress falls just a few inches past my knees, but I think it will differ depending on your height. It may be shorter on taller individuals.  You could also dress this up by adding a belt around the waist, some cute jewelry, a cardigan, or a scarf.\n\nI'm glad this dress is machine washable, although you can also hand wash it. It is recommended to let it hang to dry.  Overall, I am more than impressed by this cute summer dress.  I love the colors, the chevron design, and the comfortable fabric.  Based on all these important factors, I can honestly recommend this product.

It has cheery, feminine colors and lightweight.  I personally like the scarf because it's lightweight and feels clean and \"easy\" to wear.  I don't like real heavy scarfs that are thick in the back around your neck and make your hair stick out.  This is very comfortable and not scratchy or itchy at all.  It's of a good length to wrap in several different knots of your choosing  or to just hang loosely.  I do love the lightweight feature of this scarf; however,  this does make it more fragile and time will see how well it holds up.  You will probably need to take greater care in washing it.  I will just handwash and allow it to air dry.  So if you are looking for a lightweight scarf, I would definitely recommend this.  If you like thicker scarves or are rough on your clothing, I would probably pass.  This product was supplied to me for Free/discounted price by the vendor to utilize and assess it for their clients.

It fits like a bikini with the coverage of a tankini.\nThis would make a great suit for someone expecting but still useable when your\nnot.\n\nThis is a really nice suit.  It is very well made.  I like the weight of the fabric.  Its not\ntoo heavy nor is it thin. The top features double adjustable spaghetti straps.  It has a\nscoop neckline.  There is a bib attachment that covers the mid section.  It too is adjustable.\nYou can wear it all the way down or anywhere in between.  The bottoms are classic\nbikini style bottoms.  They have mid coverage and have elastic ties on the sides.\nFor me, the sizing was accurate.\n\nTo best care for this suit, you should rinse it out as soon as possible after each use.\nWhen you wash it, use a product such as woolite to keep it looking nice.  Woolite\nbonds with the spandex fibers and prolongs the life of any active wear fabric.\n\nI really love this suit.  It looks great and feels great.  Its stylish but conceals\nareas I may not want to bare.\n\nThank you for checking out my review.  I hope it has been helpful to you in\nmaking your purchasing decisions.  I received this item for a fair and honest\nevaluation.  I found this product to be first quality with no signs of defects.\nI would recommend this item to a friend and / or purchase this item again.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Vilania-Women-Lined-Up-Stripes-Double-Up-Tankini-Two-Pieces-Swimsuit-Set-Bikini-Swimwear-TXZ9021-Black-L/dp/B01H01OZIO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Vilania Women Lined Up Stripes Double Up Tankini Two Pieces Swimsuit Set Bikini Swimwear ,TXZ9021-Black-L</a>", "summary": "Cute suit", "unixReviewTime": 1468195200}

We'll see how it holds up over time, but the seams look good, and while the fabric isn't anything like denim, I expect it to hold up fairly well under regular usage.

I have tried other WeeUrban products and just had to get one of their dresses for my little girl.  The price is pretty steep for my taste but I know it's better quality and I liked that it was 100 percent cotton.  I was worried, initially about it shrinking after washing and drying several times but we haven't had any issues.  My daughter loves all things bugs so this honey bee design was perfect for her. I love how simple their designs are on their dresses yet they really stand out. My little girl has requested to wear it on multiple occasions already.  So far we've only used it in warm weather and some cooler mornings with a little white cardigan over it.  I think it would be adorable in the fall with a pair of black or white leggings too.  Next to the simple picture designs that are bold and beautiful, I love the ruffled neckline.  It is way too cute.  The dress seems comfortable on my daughter. She hasn't complained at all.  It's soft to the touch and something I wish would become available for adults to wear too.  How cute would Mommy and Me dresses be?!  My daughter has also learned that she could twirl in the dress and she has fun spinning around til she is too dizzy to do so anymore.  It's quite funny to watch. If it doesnt come out of the dryer right away, it wrinkles easy so make sure you are on top of that dryer when it stops!!

However, considering its low price, they are not the best in quality. These glasses are a bit flimsy, therefore the temples can easily bend if not handled carefully.\n\nBecause these glasses are polarized, they also give off a colorful effect when looking at an LCD screen. This can be frustrating at times, as the rainbow effect can be straining to the eyes. When not looking at screens, however, the lenses are completely fine. The tint isn't very dark, though it is enough to protect your eyes from the sun.\n\nOverall, I'd give 4.5 stars for the appearance of the glasses, and 3.5 for the quality.

I wanted something that would not be baggy when tucked into boots and these are the closest I could find.  The fit in the waist is about the same as Levi's 511's so order based on that.  They are still a little baggy in the seat and crotch, but otherwise better than most others.  I am 5'10, 160lbs, and had to have them shortened because they come in about a 34 inch inseam.  While they are being shortened, I also had the legs tapered so they look better in boots which is how they are likely to be worn in the winter.  The extra cost for the tailoring is well worth it because there is little you can do with a \"relaxed fit\" pair to eliminate the baggy appearance.  I washed them first to see how much they would shrink (disregard the poorly written washing instructions on the cards attached to the jeans and just wash them on cold and dry in the dryer at very low temperature).  Do turn them inside out before washing.  It takes about 3 to 4 weeks to get them because they come from China, but these are the best I have found.

This is a great message to keep on hand to read during times of weakness and to give you strength. There is a tiny steel heart attached at the end of one chain. I have tiny wrists and this doesn't fit me as well as I was hoping it would. It can be adjusted to fit, but I am left with a lot of chain hanging down. (update a few hours after this review: my husband used wire cutters and easily clipped off the excess chain. Of course I lost the adorable heart in the process, but now I can wear this bracelet and it fits me perfectly) The great detail about this bracelet is that both of the chains can be completely removed from the steel message plaque (it is attached with lobster claw attachments). So if you would rather have a leather bracelet that would look great as well with this steel plaque. This bracelet comes in a beautiful velveteen gifting box which is specifically made for bracelets. It makes a beautifully presented message and gift for someone. I received this bracelet at a discount in exchange for my honest review.", "summary": "Very cute and with a beautiful message", "unixReviewTime": 1467676800}

The bracelet is simple and about the quality you would expect for the price (similar to something you would buy at Target or Walmart). However, I love that it has a few different clasps for adjusting it so that it will perfectly fit any arm size. you also have the option to remove the bracelet part of it and string it through a necklace if you prefer. In my pictures, I have one picture showing how I looped the heart end of the bracelet back up and clipped it to the edge of the quote plaque.\n\nThe actual quote plaque measures about 1.75\" W x 0.5\" H. It is also slightly curved and sits nicely on my wrist.\n\nI'm a medical student and plan on practicing medicine in rural/underserved areas of the country. This particular inspirational quote is very near and dear to my heart, as I have it posted above my desk to give me strength through some of the tougher parts of school. I think it will also be an excellent quote and reminder to tell some of my patients who are going through tough times in their life and need an extra boost in confidence and motivation.

This dress came well packaged in two envelopes and surprisingly was not too terribly wrinkled. The dark blue was a really nice color and did not really show the wrinkles. The wrinkles came out by steam ironing them. This dress is a very lightweight material that is not the softest but feels like your typical chiffon summer cover up dress. I think that if it were to be worn with a bandeau then it could be worn as a normal dress too. The material is a little see-through, but it pretty dark for the most part. As someone who is 5'1, this dress came down above my knees and was about shorts length. It was almost too short, but it was also really loose. There isn't a category on Amazon for too small and too big. Regardless, I think that it's perfect as a coverup and I would wear it as a normal dress if the length was longer and it was not so loose up at the top. I did like the design in the back and enjoyed the dark blue color.\n\nI received this Ninimour Women's' Chiffon Spaghetti Straps Beach Coverup at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.

It took a lot time for mine to arrive it looks like it is available via prime now so that might not be a problem anymore. I mean technically the time it took to ship was not a problem for me but I just wanted to warn anyone that might want this item for a specific occasion and whatnot. I read other reviews that said this item ran small for them but it runs large for me around the underarm area. I am Asian and all these other reviews talks about it being Asian sized and whatnot but that wasn't true for me. I normally wear between a S or M depending on the article of clothing so I ordered a S for this dress and it ended up being quite loose around the under arm area and it does hang low under the armpits as well. I feel like if I don't wear the right bra for this I will be showing a lot of side boob. I think in order for me to wear this I would need to wear a wrap around bra one of those bandeau bras. Which isn't a super big deal to me because I have one but just FYI. The other thing is I think their coloring names is wrong because as you can see the picture of the \"red\" dress is more like an orange. I thought maybe that was just a photo issue but it really comes as a neon orange color. But overall it's an okay dress. For the price I'm not going to be super picky about it.

The shipping package said it all. My In Law and Wife are now fans.

I have really been looking forward to fall weather, and as soon as I tried this cardigan on for the first time I got even more excited for fall. I could wear this every day!\n\nThe color of this cardigan is a really light grey. I love light grey and I am a firm believer that everyone looks good in this color. I love the design of both the collar and the sleeves on this cardigan. The collar is nice and wide so it drapes past the back of your neck which is a really nice touch. The extra fabric on the collar is not even noticeable while I am wearing it. The sleeves are such a great length. I have had issues in the past with sleeves not being long enough, but these sleeves are truly just right. The sleeves go just past my wrists and fit the width of my arms perfectly.\n\nI find the length of the cardigan to be exactly as I had hoped it would be. It hangs past my back flows nicely as opposed to being super clingy to my back and bottom. In fact, the entire cardigan feels super nice and flowy which I truly believe contributes to it's overall great look and comfortable feel. The front of the cardigan on both sides rests easily on my chest when left open, but the fabric of each side can easily be pulled across my chest if desired.\n\nI love absolutely everything about this cardigan so far. The look, the feel and the size have all impressed me. I would highly recommend this cardigan to family and friends; it is truly a must have for fall. I have not had any issues with this cardigan at all but I will be sure, as always, to return to update my review if I do end up running into any issues.\n\nPlease note that I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions within this review are my own and I am in on way obligated to leave a positive review.", "summary": "This Cardigan has me Itching for Fall Weather!

I originally wanted to get these because they're unusual and quirky looking, and very reminiscent of the famous style icon Iris Apfel, whose documentary I recently watched. I kind of fell in love with her signature look of wearing big, circular glasses and wanted to try them out for myself. Once I started wearing these sunglasses, they proved to be very comfortable and much more functional than I expected. The large, round frames really do feel so comfortable on my face. They aren't as heavy as I expected and they keep out much more sunlight than my other smaller framed sunglasses. I also like that the arms aren't the least bit loose - they really stay put and and feel well-made.\n\nI received these sunglasses at a discount in exchange for my 100% honest and unbiased review.

Fiester", "reviewText": "Curvy women are going to love this dress, as it will show off your hour glass shape. But, the larger busted, less shapely woman may also find this the perfect dress.\n\nI am one of the unfortunate larger busted ladies that wear one size up top and another size on the bottom. I have a large waist and small hips. Subsequently, it is difficult to find a dress that looks or fits well. Therefore, I usually would never attempt to buy a dress online, unless it was a top and skirt separate. However the style and available colors of this dress just captured my imagination. I think shoes and accessories could offer both a casual and dressy look. I hate short sleeves; and over the knee hemlines do not look age appropriate for me. Deep V necklines are best for large bust lines and 3 quarter sleeves are what I like.  So, this dress seemed at first glance the perfect one on which to take a chance.\n\nFirst I ordered the dress in an XL, (bust 41.5 to 43). The dress was too small and way too short ( I am 5'4\"). BUT I loved the dress. So I reordered. This time I ordered the dress in a 1X (bust 42 to 43) to better fit my bust, a 42, and found the top fit perfectly, but the waist portion, which fits as an empire, was too large by about 2 or 3 inches. I can easily have this portion of the dress tailored since it can be hidden in the side seams of the ruched empire band or I can address this with an elastic belt. The belt will add a little detail, and either remedy will add shapeliness to my otherwise mostly straight silhouette. I bought the Royal Blue and Fuchsia; both colors have elastic belts with lovely fabric bows in matching colors available on Amazon.\n\nI like the front ruching and delicate gathers as they hide my flaws without adding bulk and look still stylish. The hemline is perfect, just below the knee but showing the curve of the leg so I don't look boxy, or thick legged. I might have the dress hemmed to mid knee for slightly more current look that can still look conservative, dressy, and modern. The pockets are not bulky and very deep, so they can actually be used. Great for parties when you just need a lipstick and your phone. The dolman sleeves make moving or lifting your arms a breeze - no pulling across the bust or binding under your arms, so there is no chance of your bra accidentally showing. The sleeves fall just below the elbow, a great length for showing off bracelets or a beautiful watch, and for the more mature woman the recommended youthful length. Although the neck line is a deep V, it is still very modest, so you get a sexy look without revealing too much cleavage. I also like the shape of the skirt that is a little narrow at the knee, giving the illusion of a shapelier hip.\n\nThe material is lightweight, but not sheer at all. It is a great travel material, or all day work dress that transitions into evening wear since it does not wrinkle. The dress is well made, with no poorly sewn seams, or hanging threads. Delicate cycle in cold water and hang to dry will keep the colors bright and the material beautiful. I am seriously contemplating getting the navy, too. That is how much I like this dress.\n\nI hope this has helped you in making a decision to make the purchase. At this price it is a bargain!", "summary": "Why the larger busted, less shapely woman may also find this the perfect dress.", "unixReviewTime": 1476316800}

This looks exactly like the Coach dress on Modcloth, which I absolutely love!  On Modcloth, this is a $60 dress.  I own one of these dresses from Modcloth, that I got on sale for like $40, and I love it.  I've eyeballed the red version of this dress for a long time, but couldn't make myself pay $60 for it.\n\nWhen I saw this version on Amazon, I was thrilled!  I quickly ordered it, and anxiously awaited its arrival.  The one thing I debated about was the sizing. Their sizing chart indicated that I should get a medium, but I knew that I bought the small from Modcloth and like the fit.  I ended up getting the medium, because I figured the size chart would be more correct than me comparing it to a different dress.  I should have gone with the small.  It's not like the medium is huge, but a small would have been better for me.  I'm still going to keep the medium, and it still looks great, but know that the size chart leads you to a bit bigger dress than it would indicate.  I guess it also comes down to what sort of fit you want.  I like a bit closer fit, and the medium is a bit roomier than I normally wear.\n\nThe fabric is thick and of very good quality.  The buttons are sewn securely on, and all the stitching is perfect.  You have no idea how fabulous this dress looks on!  This is one of those styles that flatters all figures.  It looks amazing with tights and a cardigan, too!  This hangs to my knee level - I am 5'3\".\n\nW", "summary": "This is one of those styles that flatters all figures.

It somehow manages to be stylish and professional at the same time, and I love the neckline because it's interesting but very modest. I have a large tattoo on my chest that comes up to my collarbone, and it is almost impossible to find stylish dresses that hide it for job interviews and the like. So this is a very exciting addition to my wardrobe. The fitted cut and the color I chose (red!) keep it from looking frumpy or boring. Instead it has a kind of classic, mod appeal that I'm super pleased with. Also, pockets! I love dresses with pockets so much.\n\nAs other reviewers have said, this dress runs a little large. I don't know if it's a full size larger, but if you're between sizes definitely size down. This is partially due to the fabric, a nice smooth knit with a fair amount of stretch. If the material were stiff, the Medium would have been too tight in the chest and waist for me, but since there is stretch it just has a nicely fitted look and is very comfortable. The A-line skirt is very forgiving. I'm usually a Medium/Large on top and an XL on bottom - damn the pear shape! - but the skirt on the Medium isn't tight at all. So definitely choose your size based on your shape and bust. At 5'2\", this dress comes right to my knees; you'd have to be REALLY tall for it to be short enough to be unprofessional on you.\n\nThe red color of the dress is a true dark red, very neutral, and works well with the yellow undertone of my skin. It's red enough to be exciting and dark enough to be professional. The quality is very high, with the fabric feeling nice and heavy and the buttons being solid and well affixed. It also comes with one extra button, just in case. I did notice some wrinkles/creases in the fabric when I removed it from the packaging, but I don't think the fabric actually wrinkles easily. That seems to just be a side effect of being packed tight for shipping. I plan to steam it and then take some pictures to reveal it in all its glory.\n\nBasically, buy this dress. It's perfect for going straight from the office to a nice dinner out, or skip the office and go straight to dinner!\n\nI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review, and it's awesome so I'm feeling pretty smug about it really.", "summary": "Perfect Work/Play Dress!", "unixReviewTime": 1467417600}

This style is just like one of my favorite dresses from a popular online retro dress retailer. The fabric is not too heavy or hot, so it is perfect for my style. The bust fits well and is not too tight, which is sometimes an issue for me in other dresses.  The fabric has a good amount of stretch without being too clingy. So cute! If you add tights and a cute sweater, it could transition to cooler weather as well.\nThis product was provided to me at a discounted rate for my honest, unbiased review. I rely on reviews for many of my own purchases on Amazon and will review them to the best of my ability.  I especially love to review products that I use often and enjoy on a frequent basis.

I typically wear a US Size 2 or a small in similar women's styles. I ordered the iGENJUN Women's Casual Sleeveless Midi Tour Dress Vintage Dresses in a size Large based on the provided dimensions from the seller. The Large is WAY TOO BIG on me! I am returning the Large and am waiting for a Small to ship. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND ORDERING YOUR NORMAL US SIZE. The dress, although wide, is a great conservative style for the workplace during the summer months. The wide sleeves offer enough coverage to avoid needing a sweater or jacket over the top. The skirt hits mid-thigh and is an appropriate length for work or a date with my husband. I would definitely wear this dress to work on a day when I know I am going out to dinner with my husband. The cowl neck is flattering, yet provides full coverage for my chest. I can't wait to get this dress in the right size and wear it to work! I will post an update on the fit once my new dress arrives.\n\nThe style of the dress is exactly as photographed by the seller. The material is a heavy weight jersey cotton material. It is soft against the body. The hems and seams of the dress are all very well constructed and smooth. They do not irritate. There is some stretch to the material, which allows for some play when you order your size. The cotton material is easy care in the washing machine. It washes and dries on normal cycle. The dress includes pockets too, which is a great bonus. I love being able to stick my phone or my work ID into my pocket when I leave my desk on my lunch break. Most of my dresses don't have a place for me to stick these things. Having a pocket is always a great bonus, in my opinion.\n\nDespite my trouble finding the right size originally, I love the style of this dress. It is chic and classic, yet conservative enough to wear to work. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a new addition to their daily work wardrobe. It ships quickly and since it is Prime eligible, is easy to return in the event that the fit is not correct. I recommend ordering your normal US size (disregard the measurements from the seller). This dress makes a great gift for the friends, girlfriends, wives and moms in your life.\n\nUpdate (7/20/16): I received the dress is my true size (small) and it fits perfectly. The wide sleeves are great to wear to work on a hot summer day. The length is office appropriate. It hits just above the knee. The waist hits at my natural waist. It is snug but not too tight. Same goes for the chest. The elasticity of the material makes for a great fit.\n\nI hope you found this review helpful. If so, I'd appreciate you clicking the \"helpful\" button!", "summary": "Great Professional Dress", "unixReviewTime": 1468195200}

If you have a desk job you shouldn't have to worry too much until you put it in the wash, but I have a rigid job which still requires formal wear. It even came with the back already drawn a bit, something I expect to happen easily if you brush against anything that isn't smooth. The color is also not as popping as the pic where the grey lines actually looked more beige. This dress is all green/mint, grey and black. Heaven knows I have enough grey and black clothes! Oh well, what to do. I saw where Rephyllis had great reviews online and was hoping to try a few of their dresses...now I don't think I will run that risk again. It makes no sense for me to dry clean this dress but if you are so minded, you can give it a try. I am 5'8 and it hits barely on my knees. Finally, the stitching is well done.

However there are some drawbacks and I will list them as best as I can. First off, for $45.00, you cannot beat the price if you're willing to put a little work into it. The sequins are sewn on a tulle piece which is then sewn onto the dress. This is fine except that they used clear nylon thread which does show up on the navy, not bad, but I noticed it.  I like the fact that you can lace up the back, corset style. It makes fitting it to your body shape very easy. There is a fabric \"modesty panel\" behind the laces to cover your skin. The lacing is made of the same fabric as the skirt which is a nice match. Beware, a few of the plastic jewels that are sewn on needed repair, but I already knew that due to reviews I read.\n\nThis dress runs ridiculously large. I'm 5'8\", 36C, 30, 38. I generally wear a Medium/ size 6. From the reviews that I read, people my size recommended ordering a small. This concerned me as most of the dresses on Amazon from China run very small. I usually wear a medium and order larges on Amazon, but I braved it and ordered a small. Boy was I glad I did. I was able to lace it up perfectly, the lacing was not too tight so the back looked nice. I would definitely recommend ordering down a size.\n\nThe length of this dress is another story. First off, I love the amount of fabric on this dress. Lots of yardage is used. The skirt is made up of 3 layers and I loved the feel of it. Now for the fun part. As I said, I'm 5'8\". In heels, a good 6 feet tall. I tried on this dress, with heels, and I would still need to hem it 12\" to 15\" which is crazy. The hem was a little uneven, but the fact that I would need to cut and hem 3 separate layers of fabric was a little much. It would be cost prohibitive to have a seamstress hem this due to the sheer mass of fabric. I'm an experienced seamstress and truthfully, I just didn't feel like doing it. So, unfortunately I returned the dress. However, I will most likely reorder this in the future when I have enough time to take on a project of this size. It really is beautiful and would make a lovely formal dress. Hope this helps in your decision making.", "summary": "Beautiful, but be sure to order a size down", "unixReviewTime": 1485734400}

The face of the watch measures 1.5\". I, as an adult, would wear this watch on the fourth hole (there are eight total). My eight year old niece (for whom I bought this watch) has to wear it on the tightest hole and it still seems to be a little loose. She does actually like the large face of the watch, but her favorite part of this watch was the band (I admit that I too am a bit in love with the band of this watch). It is eye catching and so cute. The design is exactly as pictured, the color of pink might seem a little lighter (as with most things on the internet). My favorite thing about this watch is that it marks the minutes in fives making it easier for kids still learning how to tell time. The smaller clocks add a more mature look to the watch, but since they are only a design they seem to make it a little confusing for younger children. The watch is as simple as it can be to set up. I don't believe that the battery is replaceable though. Having a replaceable battery would be better because there is plenty of room for a child to grow into this watch. Overall, this is a great watch at a good price, but it is quite big.\n\nI received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased opinion.

We spend a ton of time swimming since the kids love it. I like having a nice variety of swim suits. This particular one appealed to me because I can wear it alone without a cover up. I didn't figure it would be one I'd want to swim it, but I could wear it out boating just in case I decide to swim or ski. Here are some brief thoughts:\n\n-Bottoms: This fit pretty well. I ordered this in a large since I'm a size 8. I feel like a have a big bum, so since I could either go medium or large at my size, I went bigger. The shorts are too tight or too lose. The waistband is a little odd. There's elastic inside the band which shifts and flips, so when I'm taking them off or putting them on I have to make sure I don't let it shift. The color is much lighter than the picture, which was a bummer.\n-Bra: This is the worst part of the suit. This has absolutely no support. The elastic on the bottom is super loose, so my breasts could potentially fall out. Maye I needed just this piece in a smaller size for my 36B chest. I will never wear this without the black tank, which is annoying since the versatility of either the top alone or with the black tank over gives me options.\n-Tank: This is decent. It's cut nicely so you can see parts of the bra underneath.\n\n-Material: This isn't the highest quality material, but given that it's $18.99 for three pieces I wouldn't expect extremely high quality material. The colors aren't nearly as bright in the one I received.\n\nOverall, this won't be my go-to swimsuit, But it will be good for days that I want to take the kids to the pool and I'm not sure I want to get in. It leaves me covered a bit more when we're out boating as well. I am bummed that I can only wear it with the tank on, taking away the versatility of the outfit. I was sent this for testing and review purposes. That has no bearing on my rating or review of the swimsuit, this is my honest opinion.", "summary": "It's mediocre.

They are so soft and comfortable, and they lay really nice. They are very flattering because of the \"flow\" and the length.  I am 5'8\", 165lbs, and I ordered the large.  I usually wear a medium, but I didn't want to deal with the possibility of the wedgie which can happen with this material.  They sort of have a silky flow and hang like a skirt, so I don't think they add any visual weight by going up a size.  My waist is small in relation to my hips/butt, so they don't fall down.  If you are more of a straight figure, perhaps the larger size would slip down.  They fit me perfectly.  I had to cut about 1\" off the length (which many reviews complained about them being so long... it is clearly written that the bottoms are unfinished to allow for desired length by trimming)  The material does not fray, and they sort of curl gently so they don't need a hem.  The extra length is the greatest feature! I have such a hard time finding pants that are long enough, especially when they are wide bottoms. They are so light and airy, and not at all see-through.  I plan on wearing them in the hot (90 degree) summer with a light t-shirt and I think they will make the hot days more comfortable.  I also bought them in other colors (prints and solids) and I love that I can wear them with flip flops for casual, a wedge sandal for a more chic look, or a heel and blouse for a dressy look. Just love them and recommend them! (pictured are the Burgundy Paisley)", "summary": "YES! versatile, comfortable and perfect for summer", "unixReviewTime": 1495497600}

Only having one shoe stretcher stinks, I can only stretch one at a time. I have no idea why I my great grandmother only gave me one, who knows. Anyways, I figured it was time to add another one to my collection and finally be able two stretch two shoes at once. Therefore, once the new one arrived I decided to try them both on a new pair of sneakers that I have not worn yet. First, I used my older one on the left shoe, opened it all the way, and stretch it to the fullest. Then I took the new shoe stretcher, put it in the right shoe, and opened it to the fullest, but suddenly I heard something snap and the shoe stretcher it seemed like it was no longer stretching, no tension at all.  I then turned it back to the starting position and removed it from the shoe, only to find it in two pieces. Apparently, the piece of metal that holds the new stretcher together snapped apart. Wow, the piece of metal holding this stretcher together is very thin and not strong at all. The metal piece that holds my older one together seems like it is made from steel. I am disappointed in the quality of the metal they used to hold this stretcher together. Its seems like the rest of the stretcher is made from strong materials, not sure why they would use such a flimsy piece of metal. Oh well, I guess its back to one shoe stretcher for me. I received this product at a reduced price for my fair, honest, and unbiased review. All statements are my personal opinion gathered from my experience with this product.\n\nUpdate: The merchant was kind enough to offer me a new one, Apparently I received a faulty product. I've been using the new one for about a week now and it is working great! I am now stretching out my sketcher sneakers with it and it has not broken. I am very pleased with the end result of product. Although I will not change my star rating, which is based of my first experience.

This stretcher is just long enough for my 11.5 length shoes with all of the adjustment maxed out - I don't think it is long enough for a size 12.

The wood is high grade, Beech Wood, the metal screw heavy gauge, reasonable leverage on the shoe. To work this device you simply screw it down to fit in the shoe. Depending on whether your attempting to widen or lengthen you twist 1) the handle will expand the front toe 2) the upper collar screw will expand the length. You cannot do both at the same time. You either widen or lengthen. On either operation the device has very broad capability. The problem is your shoe has to cooperate. On a regular womens shoe I would look for more than half a size. It the leather is pliable maybe a little more. You can buy a bottle of leather stretcher spray (water and alcohol) or steam the tight section over a kettle (my preferred method). Over time (hours) you can slowly and very incrementally re-tighten to get the shoe bigger. I would recommend this product to my friends and family.\nPlease note that I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Great Shoe Stretcher!", "unixReviewTime": 1469318400}

What I got; a rough feeling, square shaped Gildan brand (brand of shirt that can be purchased at any Dollar General) shirt that is too short with the logo down on my stomach. I wear a 2x and ordered a 3x just to be safe because I was unaware of the brand of shirt it would be. It fits around, but barely meets the top of my pants. This product is VERY cheaply made and now I'm out 20 bucks. So thanks for that.

I had this review at 5 stars originally, but this purse is wearing terribly. I'm already noticing a decent amount of string coming out and I am not overloading this purse with weight. I just keep noticing all these small flaws that add up over time. So basically, now it's a purse I like from a distance. I'll probably end up donating it when I purge my closet next.

The excitement was palpable! These are a \"bungee cord\" type material that is firm enough that it threaded through my particularly annoying shoes with ease! The ends do not fray as you are threading either. Once you have it on you put the round clip on both ends(this required a bit of finger strength to push the holes open enough to do this). Once it is tightened to your satisfaction, you cut the laces to match you and snap on the end piece. I kept mine a bit longer in case of swelling (I wasn't a boy scout but I could have been). I then per the instructions put the end clamp under the criss cross just below the clip and walked around for a while. The clamp holds the \"strings\" perfectly with no slipping.

The package shows pictures as the instructions, which in truth are very simple, but the images are very dark and it's difficult to see what the pictures are trying to show.  Basically, you remove the regular laces from your shoes and re lace them with these in the exact same way.  The only difference is that instead of tying them, you run the ends through the cord locks and leave as much excess as you prefer and cut off of the ends.  You then secure the two ends in the cord clips that keeps the ends locked in and secured neatly without fraying. I was able to put these in my shoes in a matter of just a few minutes.  I absolutely love the color; it matches the accents on my shoes perfectly.  The stretch laces are so much more comfortable on my feet than my regular tie laces were.  I frequently left my tied so I could slip them back on the next time, but then they were loose on my feet.  These laces let me slip them off and on  but keep them evenly snug to my feet.  There are any spots that are too tight or too loose with these.

True it is heavy, but it was like jewelry for your hands to hold!  Just holding it made me feel pretty!  The box it came in said a lot about how careful it was made.  The chain was flat and luxurious; not like other loop chains.  Little magnets help keep the purse closed.  The hinges on the bottom and the hinges on the top are very well made, with the top hinge flexible to go inside the purse if you do not want to use the strap. The only problem is that I have an iPhone 8 Plus and it was just a couple cm short of fitting in.  I wanted to keep it to wear to a black tie wedding, thinking I would not carry my phone, or have my husband carry my phone for me, but that would defeat the purpose of really what I needed it for...having a phone with me.  Then I almost considered getting a non-plus iPhone because that would fit.  My goodness, the things I had to think about just to keep this purse.  In the end, I returned it.  I took some photos, but could not get a photograph of how my iPhone Plus barely fit because of the fact I was using the phone to shoot photos.  I also found it $30 cheaper on  Fawziya's website, but then when you add shipping it comes close and I TRUST AMAZON more than any other website!  So there it is.  If I had a smaller phone I would have kept it and carried it to dinners and other not so formal parties.  It really is Exquisite!  Update: finally broke down and bought it again.

I wanted a very loose top to pair with tight leggings and tight jeans.  This is a very snug top.  It is not an xl like I thought the xxxl would be.  I would say it's an m to l.  It's very short for being an xxxl.  The shirt is thin but soft.  I think it may fit better if it wasn't so short.  I can wear it but it's snug on the shoulders and chest and then too short for my style.  The lace requires that you wear a certain bra or a tank top.  I tried it with a tank top and actually liked the look.  The splash of color through the lace top and then on the bottom where the shirt is too short.  The tank top is longer than this shirt.  I can handle wearing it that way but I expected this shirt to be easier to wear by itself.  I can't even really alter this shirt as it doesn't have enough fabric to really do much with.  Overall I liked the shirt after I styled it with a tank top and gave up my dream of it being a nice loose flowy top.\n\nI received this product for free or at a discount.  The only requirement was that I give an honest review.  There is no reward for a positive review and no punishment for a negative review.  This was my honest opinion of the product.  I only accept a free or discounted product if I or my family will use the item and want the item.  I know that I rely on other reviews prior to purchasing an item and I hope that you found this review helpful.", "summary": "Thin top, small and short, sizing is off", "unixReviewTime": 1470268800}

It is sized to hold the essentials, and easy to carry. I like it and would recommend to others.\n\nEmpty and folded over (snapped closed), this item is about 7.5 inches long, 3.75 inches from top to bottom, about 1/2 inches thick, and it weighs in just under 4 ounces (per our postal scale).  Unsnapped and laid flat, it doubles in height to about 7.5 inches too. Of course, you can stuff a lot of stuff into it to increase its thickness to and inch or more (depending on what you put inside).\n\nThe item we received was in the \"Yellow\" finished leather; it is more like Golden Mustard in color, instead of yellow, but it is outstanding looking just the same.\n\nFor a bag of this size, it sure has a good amount of space! The clutch has a large slide in pocket on each side; my HTC Droid DNA slips perfectly into either space, and paper money would fit well too. There is a small zippered pocket on the outside wall of one side that is just right for a small compact and a credit card, one side of the clutch also is made into a large zippered pocket that can hold a nice set of accessories. The inside has 12 slip-in pockets made perfectly for credit cards and on with a clear plastic window made for ID.\n\nThe entire clutch is nicely lined. The zippers are nice quality metal, and I have had no tracking issues at all... no snags. If I am able to keep my daughter from taking this clutch, I think it will be a clutch that I will be able to use for a long time. Nicely made, quality item. Well done.\n\nThe only opportunity i see is that a wristlet would have been nice, but that's not worth taking a star off for. Just a thought.\n\nIf you are looking for a clutch of this design, size, color, price and leather construction, for use as I have described above, then I would highly recommend giving this affordable clutch a try based on my experience with it so far.\n\nVery recommended.\n\nGo for it.\n\nWe received this item gratis from the manufacturer or a seller, without obligation, and decided to objectively test and review it. My statements in this Amazon listing review reflect that testing experience.", "summary": "Regsun Leather Billfold Clutch - Beautiful design - Lined - Perfect size - Yellow/Mustard color - Recommended", "unixReviewTime": 1468713600}

However, I did manage to break an interior zipper. That's the reason for taking off one star. It shouldn't have broken.\n\nBut it's stylish and holds a ton of stuff. So well worth this minimal investment. If you're interested in a purse, stop looking. This one is great and don't cost much. So, highly recommended whether you're considering your first purse or want to upgrade. Yes, I said upgrade. This is very high quality for such a reasonable price.

At the time of this review, I am 67 years old and had never carried a purse (or anything slightly resembling a purse). But if they would have had something like this when I was in my twenties, I likely would have started carrying one then! I can't say enough positive things about this item to do it justice. The only caveat, is mentioned in my sixth sentence. The worrisome part of that is, I did nothing special to break the zipper. I wasn't cramming a ton of stuff in or anything like that. I simply attempted to open it after closing it twice. That's right - The third trip of the zipper ended being its last. Not enough of a bother to return, as it's very functional without the zipper. And, as you can tell by my review, I actually like this bag. And you'll like it too! Quit reading and click that Add To Cart button before they discontinue this product or some other silly reason it's not for sale. You'll like it. And it will last for years to come.\n\nI rubbed mine with some petroleum jelly for water-proofing purposes. You never know when you're going to set your purse down in a puddle of water or something. Made it a little darker. But not much difference. And the water protection makes it all worth while.\n\nThanks for reading. And enjoy your new purse! :)", "summary": "Yes.

I knew going into this that it would not fit exactly right because I am a female, but I was determined to make my cross-play come to life. I'm 5'7\" 200 lbs, 42/38/44 with somewhat wide/built shoulders. That being said, the height was good with a little bit of bunching at my ankles, chest was a little tight, and arms and fingers were waay too long. I ended up partially \"binding\" my chest with 2 sports bras and a tank to keep them smushed in place. The mask was tight all around, almost impossible to see, and I could not get my wig to stay attached to it to save my life. I did end up buying a separate mask.\n2) Looks. For this is was very simple. Closer to comic Deadpool, but it's not perfectly accurate. The red is a little brighter than expected. And because of having boobs, the chest did look a little strange to me, but the other parts to my cross-play covered the weird fit nicely.\n3) Accessories. Admittedly, I did not use them for my cross-play. The holster probably won't do you much good as it seems too small to really hold any kind of toy gun or nerf. The belt pouches were okay, only a few inches deep, and would hold small objects like cards/money, the biggest one could hold my old Windows 720 without its case. The shoulder/back strap was just really confusing and seemed cheaply made. But again, I did not use these items, so I have no idea about wear and tear or comfort of the accessories.\nOverall, it is an okay Deadpool suit. If it fits you well or you can alter it and make it work like I did, I think it's worth the money as a beginner suit or just a one time thing. If you want to become a full time cosplayer or want something really high quality, I suggest getting one custom made.", "summary": "Female wearer!", "unixReviewTime": 1504569600}

It also has a small open pocket on the back wall of the inside of the tote. Otherwise, it's designed much like your average tote. This is a well-made tote with no loose threads or seams. The stitching is straight. The bottom of the bag is sewn to expand the width of the tote. The handles are long enough to drape over your arm and you can hold it on your shoulder but the handles are just and inch or two too short to do so comfortably or for long periods.\n\nThe canvas fabric is strong and durable. This will be able to handle some weight. The printing of the giraffe and lettering is high quality. It shows no signs of peeling or fading. I like the imagery, I've always loved giraffes.  I think I would have liked the giraffe a little better had he not has a cigar. It's cute but I don't like normalizing smoking in front of my kids.\n\nNote: The product listing's image shows the lettering mirrored. It's not like this in person.

I absolutely love how this skirt looks, but don't so much love the quality and feel of it, which is why I've given it 3 stars. To be more specific:\n\nQUALITY and MAKE:\nThe fabric of this skirt is thin and stretchy. It doesn't really feel \"nice\" or \"soft\" as you would hope for a skirt, but what shiny, scaley fabric really would? I won't machine wash this for fear of stripping the scales, because it looks like the type of fabric that will quickly wear away the sparkle and scale bits.\nThe elastic in the waistband feels cheap and doesn't have much stretch. I would worry about the elastic giving out within a few wears.\nThe hem of this skirt is unfinished. It's not stitched but instead just cut across, like they stitched a piece of fabric to an elastic band and figured they were finished. On the plus side, I pulled at it a bit to see if it frays, and so far so good!\n\nFIT:\nFollow the chart in the product pictures. They are true to size! I thought this skirt would be too tight, but it actually fits just right. :D\n\nLOOK:\nThis skirt is really cute and fun. I got the black version because I wanted it to be at least slightly subtle (the others were so loud! but I also would have loved to rock them all) and I'll say that, while a shimmery, scaled skirt will never be subtle, it looks exactly as I expected. It will be fun to wear on nights out in the city, for example.\n\nIf this skirt were better made, it would have earned 5 stars from me. However, the quality (or lack thereof) really brings down my opinion. It's not falling apart, and really, it's what I was expecting from this, but it is a major factor.\n\nI received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review. I rely heavily on the reviews of others to make informed purchases, so will leave nothing but honest open reviews in return.", "summary": "Cheap, but Fun!", "unixReviewTime": 1469404800}

I wear a C cup and it looked ridiculous on me. The cups are harder and shaped, so it looked so fake. My breast were inside and did not fill them up at all but it still just stayed there and maintain it's shape. I would say probably DD cups at least for this one. I went ahead and wore it to my sisters, since i did buy it and wanted to get some use out it. One of the straps broke while I was wearing it which was funny at the time but not funny since I paid for this. I should have just returned it. I am not really happy with this one.

They are awesome. They come with a remote to control the colors and modes, there is also a button right inside the shoe that allows them to change it themselves. They are very brite and my son LOVES them. Everyone always stops us and compliments his shoes and wants to know where to get them. I highly recommend. If anything changes I will update this review. Thanks\n\nUpdate: after about 1 month and a half lights on one shoe starting going out. Today the right shoe will not light up at all. Very upset, I feel they should have lasted longer then this.

Ouija items (dresses, purses, jewelry, throws etc) are all the rage right now. But the tombstones & bats are some unique touches that really set this Ouija purse apart from the rest and will be sure to thrill the Gothically-inclined like my daughter.\nI originally had my eye on a different Ouija purse before I found this. It was more of a messenger bag type and in all honesty rather typical. Nothing special. But it sold out before I could purchase it.\nSo, I went looking & found this on Amazon and I am soooo glad I did.\nThis is much better! Not a sack. Not a messenger bag. A high quality, unique roomy but not too roomy purse with great artwork and attention to detail that arrives quickly and perfectly packaged.\nAND , of course, let's not forget the most important thing: it's going to help me win the Christmas gift-giving contest lol!\nYep, this Ouija board purse by Liquorbrand is a sure winner!

If you go with the right size, you're going to have a beautiful, elegant new outfit in your wardrobe, perfect for many social settings in the summer and spring.\n\nThe item arrives in good condition, without any bad odor stemming from it. You can iron it before use as it may have gotten wrinkled but it doesnt need ironing every time. It is very flattering and the skirt has a lot of volume. Adding that to the A-line cut, this dress gives you a unique, feminine shape.\n\nThis dress does not have a lot of stretch and isn't really forgiving. So beware! SIZE UP! To give you an example, my mom is 57 and measures 39-31-39. The size XL (12/14) fits her perfectly ending mid-thigh. I ordered one in pink for her first in a size Large but she couldn't zip up. So if you are on a RANGE of SIZE like 0 to 2, or 6 to 8, go with the BIGGER NUMBER.\n\nThe material is sturdy and very elegant, making the dress look fresh and the colors alive. The skirt has fantastic volume too! Seriously, this is one classy beauty that is a must for all you classy ladies!", "summary": "youre going to have a beautiful, elegant new outfit in your wardrobe", "unixReviewTime": 1471564800}

I was honestly expecting something of less quality because of the price, the location it was shipping from and the material. But, I am so surprised to have a unique and fun dress to wear to an upcoming Dr. Seuss themed event. I ordered style A001, with the paint splashes on the front and back. The white material is so gorgeous. It has an embossed look and is basically off-white on white paisley pattern. My Honey says the white reminds him of upholstery but I love it because it reminds me of old Gunny Sack dresses. The colors are more varied and much more vibrant than the photo does it justice. The splash of color on the front goes above and below the waist seam. There is a splash of color on the back but it is smaller and only from the waist seam down. It is lovely.\nThe material is really soft, but it is very firm and has no stretch. I went by the measurements listed in the product photos and that made me the largest size available, a size 8. (I laid down one of my favorite dresses that is similar and measured the dress like the product description instructed.) I am usually a 4-6 in dresses so this was surprising. Now, I have a history of buying Amazon clothing from China and the sizes almost always run really small compared to US sizes, so I was not alarmed at ordering an 8. It took a really long time to get here, but I ordered many months in advance of the event. I think it took about a month. I arrived folded up but still neat considering how far it traveled.\nThe fit is absolutely perfect on me and fits to my measurements!! I am so happy that this is a successful purchase because this dress is the absolute perfect dress for my event. I am a colorful person and this is going to really highlight that part of me and make me feel like a trendsetter with it's uniqueness.\nI plan to dry clean the dress to give it a seamless shape and then I will be wearing a light, white petticoat underneath. This will fill out the billowy skirt, add some length and hide my undercarriage when I bend over. *wink* This is one of my favorite purchases on Amazon ever. I will come back and attach photos of it laying flat and being worn.\nI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. When I shop on Amazon, I rely heavily on the reviews of others to make my purchasing decisions. Because of this, I try to always leave a helpful or informative review.", "summary": "Gorgeous!

I couldn't wait to give this bib with teether a try when I saw it.\nI like the look of the bib and I am happy to say that my son loves it too. He wears it and at first he couldn't figure out what's the \"green part\" of the bib but after like 10-15 mins, he starts to chew on it and seems to enjoy it a lot.\nI touched the teether part by my hand and I feel its safe to let baby chew on it. It's listed as BPA free and non-toxic, which is a must for baby. Also it's not rough at all so it won't hurt baby's mouth.\n\n** I have received this product at a discounted price.
