It is a nice costume, but be warned you will probably need to put A LOT of money or work into it:\n\n1) There are no instructions for the straps. It took 2 people 3 hours to figure everything out. Very frustrating to put it nicely. Google pictures of the costume on other sites to see how the straps go.\n\n2) I'm a big girl. Pear shaped probably size 16/18- a L on top XL on the bottom. I ordered a 1X based on the size chart just to be safe because I figured I could take it in. Well the shirt was about 3 sizes too big, and the zipper only stays up if you pull it all the way. If you want to show any cleavage you have to pin into place so you aren't X-rated. The shirt had to be rebuilt into a Baverian style shirt just so it wouldn't fall off me.  The corset was about 5 inches too big, and the skirt and leggings were about 1 size too big. The straps that go under the arm were 4 inches too long, the 2 belts were 2 sizes too big and the straps that go around the front were too short. Even the arm pieces were too big and had to be taken in. The straps that go across the back were sewn wrong (see pictures) it was supposed to be an x inside a square shape and mine would not lay flat no matter how hard we tried. Had to rip the stitches out and re-sew. There was a minor amount of tearing on the inside of the corset but since it was inside and I had bigger problems than that I let it go.\n\nI had to pay $50 in TWO ROUNDS!! of alterations to get all this work done, which should have cost me $100 but because the girl felt bad for me that it was 10 days to Halloween and was a friend of a friend I got the work done in time for Halloween. You can see my picture of the finished product. Even with all the alterations I still had to safety pin the straps under the arm to shorten them and the straps that go over the chest to give me room for my bosom.\n\nI am a big girl, I am more than ok with that. But even if I had ordered an XL to fir better all the straps would still be sewn wrong parts of the outfit were still too big. If you are a size 6 you can probably get a small or medium right off the rack and be ok. If you are like the rest of us normal fluffy girls be prepared to do some major work. I paid $140 for this and expected a lot better for the price.

There are two different colors of the dresses.  One is a very pale pink.  It's a very pale version of what I consider a ballet pink.  The other is a fuschia pink.  Both are made the same and are strapless dresses.  These dresses have some added features that helps the top to stay up.  First, they have a built in bra with a strap in the back so you can adjust the built in bra.  They also have a rubber like strip across the top that will grip your skin so that the top stays up.  We really put these dresses through the test and jumped up and down in them to see if they would fall down and they did not.  The dresses are made from the softest material that moves and flows with your body.  The dresses are very comfortable and appear to be well made.  The top has layered material as does the bottom.  They have a sash with them that could also be left off if you did not want to wear it.\n\nThese dresses would be great for prom, bridesmaids, a photo shoot or just for a night out.  I am very impressed with these dresses and for the price, I could not find a dress like this locally!  They are absolutely gorgeous when on!\n\nProduct provided as free promotional samples in exchange for my evaluation and my honest, unbiased review.", "summary": "Beautiful dresses!", "unixReviewTime": 1432684800}

Considering my challenges, I was looking for a swimsuit that would cover as much as possible without wearing a full-body wetsuit.  LOL\n\nI ordered this swimsuit in a Size 24.  The skirt is comfortable, stretchy and fit great!  The skirt goes just above the knee and hands down enough in the back that I am not horribly embarrassed.  This is saying A LOT for me.\n\nThe top is gorgeous in color, made from a good solid material and fits-ish.  In other words, the top \"fits\" but it was tight on my stomach area and made me very self-conscious.  The bra area has no support and leaves the girls sagging. The straps are not adjustable and they are too long.  The top pulls tight around my waist so it bunched up and tends to pull the skirt up with it.  I will keep it as a back up, but I found a better top with underwire and double layers in the stomach so it fits better and is MUCH more flattering.\n\nGood luck on your swimsuit quests ladies!", "summary": "Half of this suit is amazing the other half is a thumbs down.", "unixReviewTime": 1476489600}

So i couldn't get a refund or ship it back to the seller so i emailed them all they could do was give me a refund of $2 bought the shirt for $9. So i ordered another one in large, way too small I let my 12 yr old sister have it, it ft her very nice. I wanted to try one more time since I really like the shirt and had my eye on it for awhile but hesitated based off of previous reviews of it running small. So i ordered a large. It didn't fit too bad, but it was a little un comfortable around my shoulders and arms and the sleeves started to ripe in the back whenever i would put my arms out. So i sewed up the little tears around my sleeves. I was very catious to wear this shirt, i did not hug anyone and was careful to reach down to pick things up. Sleeves weren't riped, but i wore it a second time and I wasn't very careful and one of my sleeves was ripped almost half way, i only wore the shirt for a few hours and the sleeves did not survive, unless you don't have broad or wide shoulders, this shirt will work for you.", "summary": "I don't have much chest but my shoulders are pretty broad.

It actually looked so great when it was paired with shorts.  It looked so cool.  She said that this is very much comfortable to be worn and she liked that it is kind'a breathable.

The bra opens very easily with the snap closures. I would suggest that you be careful when opening and closing the snaps, because I was a little rough on mine and one of the snaps started to rip off. I caught it in time and repaired it with needle and white thread and it's still working fine, but if you rip out one of the closures, it won't be of any use to you.\nThe bra ships with a small extender piece which can make the size a little larger if you find it doesn't fit for you. For me, it was true to size. The straps all around are fairly wide. This is great for comfort and support. The only time it's problematic is if you are trying to wear a tank or a shirt with spaghetti straps, it's possible that the wide shoulder straps will show through. Also, it doesn't look great under a thin white shirt because of the black piping.\nSome people mentioned that there's not enough support/coverage; Well, I am normally a smaller sized chest, so when breastfeeding I am not overly large which might be the case for other women who have naturally larger bosoms. I can only speak for myself; it's working well for me.\nHowever, on balance, it's a comfortable, practical and cute bra for nursing mommies.", "summary": "A comfortable, practice, and cute bra for nursing mommies", "unixReviewTime": 1470355200}

I would imagine if I worked in an office enviornment the belt would last much longer. Cheers guys, just ordered another Mooniva belt!", "summary": "Belt was excellent for the first few months", "unixReviewTime": 1471219200}

The white chain is approx 4 inches and connects to a white plastic rose on an adjustable ring. My middle finger is a size 7.5/8 ring and the adjustable ring fits perfectly with no adjustment but there is room to make smaller or larger to fit your finger.\n\nSuch a great statement piece for a small amount of money.

I was pretty amazed when I found it here!\nI am about 5'4\" and 110 pounds and I ordered a small. The top was a bit loose since my chest is a bit on the smaller size. You might need a plunge bra with this dress; for me, the neckline did go lower than a normal bra, but it would have been fine if I had adjusted the straps to be slightly shorter. As previous reviewers have said, the dress is EXTREMELY long. I wore 5 inch heels with it and it was still about 9 inches too long! It was totally fine after hemming, which wasn't too difficult since the material is a thin chiffon. It is interesting to note that the bottom of the dress was not completely symmetrical before I had it cut. I think the sides were an inch or two longer than the front and back.\nAlso, the slip underneath is pretty short so you might need a longer slip or some extra fabric!\nOverall, this is a very beautiful dress, and a wonderful price.

The dimensions are 11.4 x 2.4 x 12.2 inches (LxWxH). It's smaller than most of Avber's other briefcases, but then if you're like me, you're probably carrying a lot less paper than you did years ago. So many things like brochures, product analysis sheets and supporting documents are produced electronically and traded or supplied that way. I'm not stuffing nearly as much into a belief case these days beyond an iPad or other tablet, business cards and maybe just a few documents. I don't really need to be carrying a huge briefcase. My iPad Mini fits as well as another brand of 10 inch tablet in a case. There's one huge advantage to this size case when traveling in the summer when it's often too hot to leave a tablet in the hot trunk of a car when going to lunch: This a manageable size to bring into a restaurant without it looking too bulky. This is sized more like a large-ish purse and is much more compact.\n\nAlthough this is shown as a man's case, I think it looks more like a woman's style. I asked my husband, and he agrees. It could probably go either way though. It would probably depend on the man and his industry.\n\nIt has an outside zilppered pocket that could be used for a cellphone, pens and pencils or business cards, among other ideas. It is lined in brown fabric which goes with the light brown trim on the outside. It has two sections on the inside, plus one zipped pocket and one small open slot or pocket, perhaps for business cards. It has a detachable shoulder strap which I think is a big plus. I'll attach some photos so you can see it.\nA sample less provide for testing and review.\n\nUpdate 5/25/15 - well, my husband has decided that this looks like a man's briefcase after all and he has decided that he wants to use it.

The Wife put it one last night and WOW amazing. Its super fun how the stripes cover some areas and the see through mesh lets you see the intimates. The back stripe shows of her one ass cheek but covers the other one.  On the front the Stripes also cover some areas but leave most fully visible. The material hugs the body like a glove. Super stretchy. The wife was able to walk with ease.  She loved the feel and how sexy she felt in it. She was thinking it was going to be like the cheap stuff that looks good on the model but you get it home and put it on its not even close to the same. Well this one delivered. Also comes with a mesh g string. When worn with the dress you cant see the intimate area of the lady parts. The feel is smooth and silky. Over all very very pleased with this dress.

I love how it fits! I am always wary of 1size, but this is perfect on me. I'm 5'5\", 185. It almost goes to the floor. It is revealing, but still covers certain parts (if you want it to). I really want to wear it with some heels, maybe put a G-string underneath, wear a necklace & earrings, and do up my hair. That's how this makes me feel. This has quickly become my favorite piece I own so far out of about a dozen pieces. My boyfriend says it's yummy & I haven't dressed it up for him yet.\nOne tiny thing I don't like are the straps. 2 attached to the front and 2 to the back. I kinda want to just use the front ones to make a halter type tie. I might cut off the back ones. I guess I could tie front to back or whatever configuration I come up with.\nI was fortunate enough to receive a discount for this product in exchange for an honest review.

Not a big deal, but just something of note. It could be possible to change up the way the straps sit, like to maybe cross them in the back instead.

All too often, I ordered what looks like a nice gown and it is either tee tiny to wear or ,if stretchable for curves, it is often flimsy material that runs at a touch.

One size fits all is often a scary statement, but I do think this piece could be complimentary to most shapes, if not all. The material is extremely soft and comfortable and grabs all of the right curves without clinging insultingly. It moves with you amazingly and shifts in a way that makes you feel....sultry, I think is the word I am looking for.

The same with the ratchet belt - I really like how it 'ratchets' to more lengths than a belt with holes - and the holes are seldom in the length I really want..\nI got this particular belt because I like the colors and the style - not to plain and not to fancy.\nThe leather of the belt is a nice thickness - it seems like it will be durable.  But it does have 3 layers, and can't tell what the middle (thickest) layer is.\nHave to take a star off for the instructions, which don't even tell u how to take it off!!  I put it on when I opened it, and got a bit scared when  'Take it off' is not the instructions.  Obviously I figured it out - if you have it on 'tight', you HAVE to pull it just a bit tighter to be able to use the release button/lever on the bottom of the buckle.  The instructions also don't tell you how to trim the belt to length. It's a simple matter of removing the buckle and cutting the belt, but... I didn't realize how much of the belt HAS to stick out of the buckle for the first ratchet.  I added a photo of the belt at the first ratchet.  If I gain much weight, I'll have to buy another belt!!\nAlso; the end of the belt that sticks out is embossed with an apple logo and \"oxiguo\".. Dunno wut that means.

Well, I definitely agree. It's a great design, easy to adjust, holds tight all day, looks high class. My only real complaint with this particular brand is the belt cracked heavily on the inner area after less than 6 months which caused the belt to stretch and no longer stay tight throughout the day. I contacted Mooniva who told me that was not normal, and to their credit, they promptly sent a completely new belt. I was very impressed by the service and was optimistic it would last longer this time around. However the new belt is only a few months old and it already has started to crack on the inner surface. I'm tempted to contact them again but I don't want to feel like a freeloader. I don't believe at this point that I was just unlucky with this product. The leather is probably not up to par. My friend had his belt for many months prior to me getting the first one and all this time later his has not developed even a surface crack. I love the buckle choices with this brand so I hate to think I might switch to Mission which has more limited styles. Also the customer service is top notch. Perhaps I could use the Mooniva buckle with the Mission belt.\n\nUPDATE 11/29/16: As I was leaving the house this afternoon the buckle detached from the belt. It ripped the leather where the prongs attach. I ended up cutting about a 1/2 inch off the end and re-attaching the buckle. The belt is not holding my pants up as well as it did when I posted the original review.

I do think it's so pretty and I'm still going to find a way to start it but the thing is,I ordered American medium and I got a large. The arms to which are knitted are kind of tight but it does look beautiful. The knit has great detail and I love the flare over my hands but the fabric is kind of rough. So between the tight fit of the arms and the roughness of the fabric it makes that part of the top  alittle uncomfortable but still wearable. That is why I docked one star. The other star is docked because I ordered a medium and I received a large and around the stomach/ torso area its super huge. I don't know right now if I should try to send it back, or just find a cute way to fix the shirt so it's wearable. I don't know yet really what to do...i wanted to wear this so bad, and the design and how it's made is beautiful. I just wish they would have sent me the right size. But by the tightness of the arms, a medium may not have fit my arms. Btw I'm 115 pounds and 5'4 in height so my arms are far from big. But maybe they just make the arms a bit smaller so they fit snug against your skin. If that's the case I'd love to have a medium torso with the larges arms lol. The bottom part, to which is knitted to, is long and pretty as well. The fit does have a different look from the picture here on amazon but other then that it looks like the picture. It came in a outer plastic shipping package and inside the shirt was wrapped in another see thru plastic bag, so it was packaged good. And like I said it came pretty fast. It's exceptional for the price and for all the people out there that say why are you complaining about anything if you still got a pretty wearable shirt for 3/4 $, first off that's still money, money I could have put on something else money that I earned, so i deserve to get what I ordered and I want to be completely honest to help other people. So any ways if I did get the size I wanted, I would have only dedicated a half of a star for the snugness and rough fabric of the arms. I have bought another item from theses same people/company but it has not arrived yet, it's a small dress/swimsuit cover. I REALLY hope it comes in a medium. So as of right now I would order from them agin, I would just write them and make it clear what size needs to be sent, or send them my measurements so they could suggest and send the right size..i LOVE the price, I love how good it was shipped,I love that it was packaged good, I love the way the shirt looks and the design of the knitted parts. I just hate that they sent me the wrong size.. So far I would recommend but that may change after I receive my other product..", "summary": "wrong size but beautiful shirt", "unixReviewTime": 1431302400}

It's really cute. The tulle hits me mid-calf and the the lining just at the knee. It's very fluffy and fairy-ish. It's not as poofy as it looks in the photo buuut that's probably because it's a layer of tulle gathered with layer of lining rather than several layers of fabric. Sooo it's gotta stretch over my 29\" waist and that brings down the petticoat-look it's got in the photo to more of a soft, gathered look. Still cute.\n\nHoping it'll hold up well in the wash. It does feel a little weird on because of the lining. Not sure if it's the fit or the material, but it's not a big deal. Also not sure if I'll wear it with a shirt tucked in to the waistband or not, as it does make everything kind of shapeless from the waistband down since it's just gathered squares of fabric with an elastic waist.\n\nIn any case, bought this for a Pam Poovey cosplay and expecting to work out fine.

The description says beaded sandal, but it came with a ring  so that makes it additionally confusing. Customers should clearly know what they are getting - it's all very confusing.\n\nThe packaging does not lend itself to sending it as a gift. It came wrapped in plastic, that's it. The sandal is cute, but made with those super cheap beads and the ring has the string sticking out where it was tied off (see the attached picture). Simple attention to detail/quality control and this could easily have been avoided.\n\nI give this item 3 stars because it's cute.

Especially since I always leave something in the other bags, and it's always something that I probably need, that whenever I'm changing out bags and usually rushed. It's kind of a pain.\n\nThis bag is a super soft leather, and the lining inside is a fabric lining, but it's really nice and soft also. The stitching inside is amazing, so I have no bigger than the landing is going to come undone.\n\nThis bag is not one of those flimsy floppy bags it's going to fold over there's not enough in it, not that I have that to worry about, but I'm saying that you don't have to worry about it looking weird whenever it's sitting flat. It has a nice bottom, and although it doesn't have the steel buttons on the bottom, it's still will sit perfectly flat.\n\nIt has two pockets on the inside, on argue one that will fit my phone and whatever else I decide to put in it, and the other one I use for my need to get to quickly pocket kind a like me debit card. But this bag is huge, and it will fit comfortably.\n\nIt's beautiful and it's very low made. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wanted a bag that you didn't have to change out every day. The colors are beautiful, vibrant, and it's just different.\n\nI received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.", "summary": "SOOO big and beautiful!", "unixReviewTime": 1442880000}

But still unexpectedly small--barely fit my hip in (the lace design allows some flexibility), and could cover 3/4 of my butt. I would not expect a larger size would help bc of the design--it's just cut to be inappropriately short to wear outside.  Can only wear it at home to tease your partner or narcissisate yourself.

Also removable.\n Two sets of handles?!! One set for carrying on shoulder, one set for by hand (which doesn't get in the way when not in use). I didn't notice this when checking out the product and am delighted.\n Side pockets, also unanticipated, are wide and deep enough to hold a water bottle or mini umbrella.\n The space between two inner zippered pockets is connected to make a tray-like pocket (it's quite wide, not flush with the side) that will let you keep important things at hand rather than buried in with the rest of your stuff; in my photo, it's a pill casethe one with white/gray sides and a blue strap around one side. FYI I have tiny hands.\n\nSome folks have discussed quality issues, but this thing seems fairly sturdy.\n\nSure, over time I could see the zippers getting messed up, the zipper pulls snapped off, the cross-body strap clips broken, or the lining ripped (although it's thicker than most, it doesn't seem super durable)it's not the highest quality stuff.\n\nBut the core bag and attached straps?

I am a bow-tie junkie. I have quite a few (50+) bow-tie within my collection. What that said...\n\nI found this brand while searching for new colors and designs for a cruise in the Caribbean. I wanted unique colors and patterns that would work well for both formal evenings as well as normal casual dinners. I was also looking for good material that would hold the correct shape, while being easy to tie and untie as some materials are stiff or cause friction against itself. These little beauties are GREAT. They tie easily, have a wonderful look and have great color choices. Best of all they also come with pocket squares which in some cases would normally be the same price as the tie itself. Having the matching pocket square for the jacket makes all the difference in the world.\n\nIf you are looking to either have just one bow-tie for a special event, several to add to your collection for lots to build a collection I certainly recommend these as they will not break the pocketbook and will last a long long time through wear after wear.\n\nIf you have never tried a bow-tie I HIGHLY suggest it as it is such as classy statement with a nice suit, or even with a button up and jeans. They are great for most occasions and have the added bonus of not getting in the way when eating, drinking and therefore do not have the hazard of having food dripped, dropped or dragged across them.", "summary": "Wonderful Tie!", "unixReviewTime": 1451952000}

Granted I have gained some weight over the summer so that might be making me feel like I look worse in this than I do so that is another reason I'm at 4 stars.\n\nIf I had to guess I would say that an XL in this shirt is closer to a 10-12 than a 14-16 which is a standard XL. It's a shame really because I love the simple understated elegance of this shirt; I think it would look great with a pearl necklace and the material allows it to be either business attire or casual.\n\nI received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Runs small but is well made and a lovely shape", "unixReviewTime": 1443312000}

The Amazon one is very wrong. The dimensions provided in Jiqiuguer's sizing chart are very accurate, and you will not be surprised by how something fits.  I am 5'3\" tall, weigh 135 pounds,  and purchased the size small.  It fits fabulously.  It is loose and flowing, and extremely comfortable.  It is big on me, but that is the style of the clothing, and is exactly why I purchase it.\n\n  I have purchased many, many garments from this company, and can tell you, in all honesty, that these are some of the best garments I have ever purchased. Everything is made of the highest quality fabric, and is assembled with care.  Seriously, I have never even found a loose string on these clothes.  The stitching is beautifully done, and the fabric is of a good, quality weight.\n\nOne of the things I really like about this dress is the neat detail down the front of the dress.  The darker blue with the stitched on strips of the lighter blue really stand out, and add interest and fun to this dress!  It is a nice light fabric for the summer months (but not cheap fabric), and the fact that it hangs wide is going to be so comfortable in the heat!\n\nWith all of these clothes from this company, I hand wash, gentle wash, or spot clean, to make  them last longer.

Most belts now require a fastener into one of several holes for best fit.  The problem is that every time the belt is fastened, it needs to be flexed back and tensioned in an unnatural state.  Eventually the belt wears out because of all that crimping and tension.  This belt eliminates the holes along with regular belt fastening issues.  Fastening with this belt is very straightforward, smooth & zipper like, with even a zip like feel & sound.  Tightness is adjusted in fractions of an inch.

There are headbands with rosettes, flowers and even a bow.  The headbands are embellished all kinds of bling - from beads to sparkles.

It is not as flattering for an 'apple' body type as it would be for a 'pear,' but it isn't bad either. The length is good and the color is pretty. I think I ordered the blue, but in some light, it appears more blue-green, which I like very much. It is also fully lined, which I wasn't expecting. The bottom layer is attached to the liner. This could be a good thing or a bad thing. It makes the dress more substantial. I bought it for an upcoming trip to the tropics, but may have to rethink using it there, as it may be a little bulkier for packing, harder to launder (really needs ironing after a wash), and not as cool. However, for the relatively cool area I live in, it will be a perfect summer dress. It did seem to run true to size.

If it was any thinner you could see your heartbeat through it.\n2. The advertised soft cotton feels like dryer sheet chemical coated cheap fabric.  I had to wash it before trying in fear of exposing myself to anything banned by OSHA.\n3. The fabric is so see through I could only wear this to a wet tee shirt contest but its so thin I wouldnt even have to get it wet\n4. The sleeves don't stretch basically making your arms feel like sausages at your slightest moves.\nI will try to return this shirt.  My fears are that since it shipped from China I am S.C.R.E.W.E.D.  I mean I buy $9 shirts at Target all the time and they are superior in everyway, shape, and form.  If I had to give this shirt a price it would be in the negitives.you would have to pay me to own this shirt.  This was a total let down!  I hope you can learn from my mistake.

However the size options available are not suitable for people with a small bust and a not so small waist. I had to order several sizes up inorder to accommodate my waist measurements(32 inches) but the bust size that correlated to it was 39 inches( too big for me)\nWhereas it fit perfectly at the waist for me, I had to make a lot of adjustments to the bust area inorder for it to fit. It didn't help that the dress came with padding at the bra area-the pads were of course large since that was the size they were stitched to accommodate. Since the fabric was lace and delicate, the adjustments had to be made very carefully.\nI also did not like the heart shaped lining and opted to line it to the neckline-this was easily accomplished-I am very conservative when it comes to necklines and their linings therefore I opted for a higher neck lining(anyone who doesn't mind a lower neckline would be ok with this design)\nOverall, I love this dress, its design(sleeves, fully lined, alternate lining under the original colours) and the classic black and white colours. The lace is absolutely gorgeous.\nI recommend this to others, except for the adjustments needed. This is my first dress from everpretty and I was pleased with their service-they have a call number for returns/exchanges and they are efficient. I would order from this seller again should the need arise. It came well packaged, with no damage and minimal wrinkles.\nI did notice that in general everpretty dresses don't accommodate an apple/pear shaped person. Don't know if the sellers can post a link/way to contact them for certain measurements for a more customized fitting. It would be worth it if they could.\nHappy with my classy dress!", "summary": "Beautiful but needs adjustments.", "unixReviewTime": 1461628800}

It was very large in the waist area, but much too tight in the chest area - so tight that I can't even wear it. I was disappointed, because I waited over a month to receive the item (but that's non-prime free shipping for you, oh well, can't complain about that), and when it got there, it didn't fit. I contacted the seller for a return to get my money back at least as the dress had never been worn, but I'm not sure at this point whether or not I will even return it, because even though I ordered according to the posted measurements which were wrong, I have to pay the return shipping.

Which brings me to my biggest gripe, the zipper.  As you can see in the picture, there is a normal zipper dangling around the neck area when the shirt is fully zipped.  What arrived is a big and bulky round zipper handle contraption that wobbles too and fro as you move (see pic).  Also, the zipper is on the left side although you wouldn't be able to tell in the pic.  This may not be a minus as I am not sure how other countries zippers operate to be honest.

Truthfully, I would not recommend this cover-up.  I purchased one at our local grocery store on clearance for $7 and my husband couldn't stop raving about that one and with next day shipping this cost well over $25 and he didn't like it at all.  I really wanted to wear my cute white swim suit that didn't look right with my grocery store cover-up so I still wore this; however, definitely no compliments and nothing exotic looking about it at all.

The material was defiantly not capable of being heat treated, so I gave up trying. Second issue I noticed, was that the zipper was jammed half-way down the back. I fiddled around with it for about 5 minutes before I finally set it free to try on the dress. The dress had no elasticity in the torso what so ever, and the top half was straight cut and the skirt was a perfect triangle, making even the skirt look horrible. The dress was so scratchy and stiff, it felt like it was composed  hundreds of crumpled up paper balls. Once I got the dress on, I realized the button for the back was far to large for the tiny elastic it was meant to be slipped through, and the sleeves poofed up awkwardly on my shoulders from the high positioning of the arm elastic. The sewing was definitely not done properly, and there was many loose threads hanging from the dress. I'm 5'7\" and 115lbs, and it hung off around my body in a way even a belt wouldn't fix.

I am extremely sensitive to pressure against any part of my body but I need to keep my pants from falling down so have no choice but to wear a belt.  The webbing kind with the plastic click buckle have been my best bet up till now but are a bit narrow and have no stretch at all so when you sit or bend they put pressure on your stomach.  The thicker  wider military cotton webbing type with the open buckle you loop the webbing through then pull it back do the same thing - both are ok when you are walking and standing but when you sit or bend they cut into your mid section.  I put this baby on as soon as I got it - while standing in the parking lot of the market - I couldn't wait to give it a try.  I can't even tell I'm wearing a belt when I have it on. I usually wear cargo pants and this belts JUST fits through the loops - making it a little slow to switch from one pair of pants to another.

In no way is it worth $660.00. I have one and I paid $65.00 for it. I have not had the watch long enough to give it a fair rating, but I am grateful I did not pay more than I did. I was going to return the one that I have, but decided for the money I paid, it would be worth it to keep the watch just to see how long it lasts, and YES, it is the exact same watch available here for $660.00, verified by my research. I looked at Amazon first, before looking at other sites.\n\nPlease read the description carefully. It does not tell you where the watch is made, only that it has a Swiss movement. Swiss movements can be of fair quality up to the best high quality. The face of the watch says Swiss, not Swiss Made as is on all Swis made watches. The rear of the watch has no indication of watch features, as is typical of all Swiss watches and most other watches. There is no watch case included nor is there a manuel, only a cardboard box and a small sheet of paper that explains that the box is used to help preserve the environment and a Made in China sticker  on the bottom of the box. A box sleeve covers the sticker. There is also a small card that directes you to a web site for a users manuel, again to help preserve the environment.\n\nThere is so much bull about bull in the description that it really is difficult to determine exactly what you are buying. There is no way to verify the features of the watch, its origin, or quality. The only thing that can be verified by looking at the watch is that it is exactly as pictured, looks to be titanium, and is a Bull brand.\n\nThe back of the watch is stamped or engraved with the Bull name and logo, followed with the words \"strong like bull\". A typical Asian translation\nof \"strong like a bull,\" and yes, there is enough room to add the extra letter.\n\n Who knows, maybe the watch is okay.

One daughter found a dress locally that we purchased but the other daughter wanted to look online hoping for a greater selection.\n\nWe found this dress and, at $35-$40, it was priced similarly to the dress purchased locally. In addition, it is similar (not identical) in styling and both dresses are black. We purchased it thinking that the quality would be comparable but... it definitely is not!\n\nThis dress is made of a cheap lace and underlining and is not constructed nearly as well as the dress we purchased locally (that one fit well and has a zip-up back). In addition, there was a small hole in the lining in the back and the dress had deep creases and wrinkles that were difficult to remove because the manufacturer had crumpled up dress and crammed it into a bag that was much too small. The bust area runs large because of the long shoulder straps and the dress left my daughter uncomfortable due to the amount of cleavage that was left on display. Fortunately, I know how to sew and was able to take in the straps and repair the hole (we did not have enough time to return the dress and re-order a different one). Since there isn't a zipper or button in back, however, we were limited in the amount the dress could be altered (without deconstructing the entire thing) while still allowing for enough headroom to slip the dress on. So, if you are smaller breasted, this dress may not work for you at all. A couple of the seams were rather ratty, too, and we had to snip several threads that were sticking out in random places. Although the dress (after alterations) was cute once she was wearing it (hence 2 stars rather than one), neither of us would purchase it again.", "summary": "Poor construction and cheap materials", "unixReviewTime": 1455321600}

I really like the color and the dial is pretty simplistic. It also has a Japanese movement, and i am a big fan of Japanese movements. Personally, I think the watch is pretty stylish and looks great from a distance. But if you were to get up close to this watch you would see exactly why it costs as much as it does. There is dust on the dial which means that the factory this was completed in was not that clean. The glass edges are rough and appears cheaply produced. The sub-dials do not work, or at least there is no way to change the month or date (it might work, but has no way to change the sub-dials from their preset date/month, I do not know). The crown has a lot of play in it when you change the date, and leads the minute and hour hand jumping when you try to set the time. The case is reportedly stainless steel, but i am not sure if that is true (it doesn't look like any of the other true stainless steel watches I have). The back is a snap back and is probably not water tight. The description for the watch states that the band is \"leather\", however the Watch Information section states that it is \"Letherette\". The strap is definitely not real leather, this description is something they need to fix. The clasp is not too bad, but there is still a good amount of play in it. This makes it difficult to actually put the watch on because the strap is so thick and hard to flex. The little loops that hold the strap down are very cheaply made and are hard to use with the thick/non-flexible strap. Overall this watch has very few positives going for it: japanese movement and style; while having multiple negatives. I'd recommend it for anyone that buys watches just for stylistic points and does not care about functionality or quality.\n\nI received this product with a discount in exchange for an honest review from amazonreviewtrader.com. My rating is non biased and comes from my experiences with the product.

You must have ordered a different dress or they really cheated you. I really like it! It fits perfectly! I'm usually a size 2-4 with dresses, weigh around 116 pounds and I'm 5'3 in height. I ordered a small since I figured it was a loose dress that would fit fine around my waist and bust, and it did! If you're a 34B and have my body build described above, I recommend buying a small unless you like it to fit looser. I bought this for a wedding and I think it'll look really cute! The color is a bit more pink than in this photo. The color in the photos is more pinkish beige, the dress I received in more baby pink, or lighter pink. Definitely more pink, either way really cute color.\n\nPro: fits nicely around my bust/waist area. Straps are adjustable so the front portion isn't loose or showing anything. Material does not look cheap, hems are nice and organized, well-made. Low-cut area is well-made and looks sexy, yet classy!\n\nCons: REALLY see-through! Not really in the chest area or frontal region, (although it wouldn't hurt to cover that area either but it would be more difficult since it is cut low) but when I looked at the back part near my bottom, I could see my underwear! It was a bit embarrassing so I definitely recommend wearing at least a white/pink/beige skirt or slip of some sort to cover that area. Like I mentioned above, I am a bit on the shorter side. I'm 5'3 and this dress could fit someone that was 5'8 WITH heels and still graze the ground or cover their shoes! It was dragging terribly even when I was in heels! I recommend getting it cut/altered, as this dress is way too long even for the average sized woman wearing heels. It is probably for a model. I wouldn't recommend it for a more modest person, since it is cut low and does show lots of back area.\n\nIt is a beautiful dress and I definitely would recommend it!

I rarely find dressy slacks that fit without major adjustments! These size 18s are a couple of inches too long, but that's an easy fix. I ALWAYS have to hem my pants, since I am 5'4, about 180lbs and very short-waisted. My husband calls me \"dumpling\" (affectionately, but it's also a fair description of my body type). Thus, the 'petite' tends to be too short. The fabric is soft and stretchy without being baggy. I agree that getting the larger size and washing before wearing is a good plan. My Ivory slacks shrunk up just enough after washing and 20 minutes in a warm (not hot!) dryer, that the fit was perfect, where pre-wash, they were a bit loose in the waist. (I also got a pair in Olive, which feel the same, but I haven't washed/dried those yet.) Mind you, I am a dumpling, built like a boy. Straight waist, slim legs. If you are slim-waisted with full thighs, this cut won't flatter you.\n11/25/16 Update\nSo I have since ordered a total of 8 pairs !! in size 18, various colors. The last 4 are en route, but so far, the quality and fit are very consistent. (It's so annoying when you purchase the same product in a different color and it's not the same quality or fit!) I intend to make these my primary slacks for work. I recently had abdominal surgery with multiple incisions that are slow to heal, and I must wear dress slacks to work. The buttons, zippers and bulky plackets of my ordinary slacks were so painful! These pants have a sturdy, stretchy, but soft texture that is perfect. BTW - I did order up a size so that when I sit, the waistband doesn't pinch and chafe. I love them!", "summary": "Very nice slacks at a perfect price!", "unixReviewTime": 1478563200}

I have purchased a few of Azules skirts in different colors.  So far all of them are well-made in a soft, flowy fabric that is pretty close to exactly the color shown (taking monitor differences into consideration, of course.) The color called \"silver\" actually is a light, silvery grey, not a heather grey at all, and the eggplant color is a gorgeous, rich purple.  And the fit is right on.  I'm just under 5'6\" tall and a curvy/muscular 160lbs, and the size large fits me perfectly.  I'm sure I'll order more of these maxis in the future in other colors.  I like that I can fold the top over if I want to wear sandals or flats with it, or unfolded to get that extra length on that rare occasion I actually don heels.  I should add that I wear Jockey's smoothing slipshorts underneath because they are great at killing the lumps and bumps all women have (to varying degrees) on their backside.  That way I not only don't worry about the cling of the material of the skirt, I also have the confidence of knowing it accentuates my firm, round backside. (Btw, Target carries those Jockeys at a much better price - $12 - than I've found them for here on Amazon.)\n\nTo quote my boyfriend, \"I never liked those skirts on women before, they usually look frumpy.  But on you, it's just sexy as hell.\"  Yes, he is a very smart man.  =)  That's why I keep him.\n\nOh, if you're looking for a maxi that is more airy and revealing, take a look at VIV Collection's side slit maxis.  Those and the Azules are my favorites because of consistency of quality and fit.  I tend to rotate through them just to keep him guessing.", "summary": "Consistent quality and fit.", "unixReviewTime": 1469145600}

If you are looking for that to be a stand-out feature, it isn't. I have had several pictures of me taken wearing these glasses and you would never know the top edge was tortoise.

The bottom of the shades are sort of a sea glass color.\n\nThe first time I put these on to go outside, I was REALLY impressed. They were SO clear! They did not distort the color of things so much like my Foster Grant sunglasses, and my vision was just overall clearer (to be fair, my Foster Grants are \"well loved\").\n\nI was frankly surprised they were sold as \"Cat-eye,\" because the cat-eye shape is not pronounced at all (especially compared to another pair from a different company I bought that were very pointy at the outer edges and had a very obvious cat-eye shape). I don't care if they're cat-eye or not. I just love them! I get compliments constantly...first time I remember getting compliments on a pair of sunglasses!\n\nI am very happy with these!\n\nUPDATE 8/25/16: My glasses unfortunately broke this past week. I tried gluing them, but it didn't take. They broke at the top inside of the right eye frame and the lens fell out while I was walking the dog. The break is at a place that is crucial to keep the lens in, so that sucks. As a result of breakage this soon after buying the glasses, I've lowered my rating to 4 stars. Really should be 3, but I do love these glasses.", "summary": "Not distinctly cat-eye, but super cute and I love the sea glass color of the lower frame.", "unixReviewTime": 1469577600}

The faux leather looks cheap, but again, has held up. The hardware connecting the straps to the bag are very sturdy.

There is a little extra room so someone with a little larger bust could still fit this size. It fit me well and its snug where its meant to be, but not uncomfortable. It has a great fit and flair shape which is really flattering. It enhances my curvy/busty figure and makes my waist look small. It is a little long for my 5'3 frame. It is a little past mid-calf, so I will probably have it hemmed a little.  The purple and black floral design is so pretty! It comes with a tie  belt made in the same fabric. I tried it with a black skinny belt and it looked cut like that too.

I purchased this product to be used as a blouse rather than a mini dress.  The fit is nice, the material is thin but comfortable.  There is a significant amount of static for the product material but that is ok with me.  I ordered the green color and it is more like a seafoam green. When worn off the shoulders, it is very comfortable and the elastic holds well without slipped.  The only thing I wish they would have changed is the white elastic large band used on the inside around the top as you can see this a little from the front.  Also - if you are wearing it on the shoulders rather than off the shoulders, the arm holes are a bit small and the fabric may rub against you.  The stitching is sturdy and the blouse is 2 layers thick.

It's a bit short for wearing without tights in the office, so I'm trying another print in L in hopes of getting a little extra length and a looser fit on top. I'm 5'7\", size 9 with a fuller lower half. I like how the middle of the dress hits just above the thinnest part of my waist.\n\nI got the Egypt Dark and was praying it was a black background, but it is more like a dark wash denim blue. It still looks good, but blue is definitely not my best color! It's a very muted blue, so take note if you are expecting \"Egypt Dark\" to mean black.\n\nThe only reason I deducted a star is because the top and skirt part don't have the print lined up, so the dress looks a little sloppily made.

The front center jewel is attached crookedly and the bottom dangle was only held together by an ugly straight pin-should have been a chain to keep with the look of the rest of it. We had to completely rework many pieces of it in order to get it to look decent. The back of the necklace Was completely broken when we took out of he box. the two side pieces weren't connected to the center so the flower jewel hung completely down onto the other chains and looked horrible!! It also was packed horribly whichay have contributed to the fact that it was in such bad shape. It was crammed into a tiny box that was meant to hold a single necklace - not an elaborate shoulder necklace.

First of all, it fit PERFECTLY! It is exactly what I was looking for as my costume, but once I put it on, I fell in love! I did wear it once as an actual dress to a small gathering before it got too cold in New York, but now that it's spring I plan on wearing it a lot! It is a great party dress- I can see myself wearing it to summer barbecues or graduation parties. Swing dresses and maxi dresses are about all I can pull off, so I truly feel comfortable in this dress. I got the rose color, which I didn't love at first, but needed for a costume. When I saw it on, though, I was shocked at how much I liked it. Anyway, as I said it fits perfectly. The dress is stretchy all around, but most importantly in the bust. I usually have trouble in that area because I am bustier, but I had no problem with this dress. I could go on and on, but seriously- you need this dress! I don't have a great pic of me in the dress YET, but here I am as Bing Bong from Inside Out :p", "summary": "but I absolutely love it! First of all", "unixReviewTime": 1462838400}

I think a medium would have been too big. The sizing is off. I don't find the fit very comfortable, but I planned to wear this to an event so will keep it and hope the zipper doesn't break.

There are 4 gold charms that look like puppy feet in the shape of a heart. Also are 4 more gold charms that are just a decorative piece. There are two dangle charms. One is a gold flower with a purple stone and the other is a heart key lock with a heart key.\n\nThe snake chain bracelet is silver but has a gold clasp which is not easy to open. It does seem to get easier with more use. It is stamped with 925. Theres also a gold sunflower safety chain so the charms don't fall off. The safety chain is a screw on and can simply be screwed off over the end of the bracelet if needed. This allows you to add or remove charms.\n\nI ordered the 18cm bracelet because I have small wrists. It actually fits me pretty well. The bracelet is fairly heavy weighing at 2oz. The bracelet and charms seem to be very durable. The gold is bold but I don't like the mix of the silver glass beads and the silver bracelet with it. This definitely needs to have a gold bracelet. It just throws of the look to me. Other than that, its very pretty. It would make a great gift option for a teen or adult.

The smell is great if you are an artistian, motorcycle rider, or seriously a southern gent. Keeps my coins in its pocket, I would say it holds more than I expected. It does come with a disadvantage of growing a half an inche taller when sitting but brings hood habits to the table.\n\nI bought this particular wallet due to loving handmade Japanese wallet and how the wallets came in coin pockets! I wanted to find an American counterpart since I don't have a ticket to Japan, plus Amazon has made my life so much easier. It DOES NOT have an ID sleeve like many tend which is perfectly fine with me since personal security is an issue in today's world. Oh and thanks for anti-NFC card, I do not have one of those cards but Im due for an upgrade sooner or later so that will come in handy.\nThe rope is not a thinned out hot topic wire thread, its a very firm material took me a month to loosen; its not a con just a assurance for good quality material. It replace my Assassin Creed Black flag wallet, which had been my friend for 6 years and looking at this wallet I can not go back maybe a side wallet. But however primary wallet for functionality and show of character, I really think for the price you pay it was worth it for how well this held against the elements. I have the carbiner, it is not a small carbiner; its thick and here for buisness.

The socks wick the moisture away so well that after 3 hours of riding in 100+ degree weather here in Oklahoma city, Oklahoma I don't even know that my feet are sweating or even moist.  For longer rides I do plan on taking along an extra pair of socks to switch out after 3-4 hours. This is something I learned in the military.  No sock is perfect.  Take care of your feet!  These socks are about as close as you can get to perfection.  If they had been manufactured from wool they would have been perfect.  I love these socks and I highly recommend them.

The inner lining is very nice, the fabric is strong but elegant.  There are a few pockets to help organize your items.  There is ano adjustable strap so you can wear it on your shoulder or disconnect it to use the wrist strap or place it under your arm.

The bag itself is VERY light weight. The material is very soft and nice to the touch. There is a short strap to carry this as a very large wristlet. The top zipper is easy to open BUT beware of the inner liner catching. The inside is lined with a thin fabric. It is not affixed to the inside walls. Therefore, if the liner is shifted up, it can get caught in the zipper teeth when opening. When I opened mine for the very first time the material got stuck.  I managed to free the zipper and inside there are three separate compartments.  The liner inside can be pulled and lifted up and out of the bag for easy cleaning.\n\nTwo compartments are lined with that brown fabric. The center one is synthetic leather as the exterior of the purse. There are two open top pockets for putting your cell phone inside and one zippered pocket which is nice and big. This comes with a shoulder strap that is soft and comfortable.  This purse has a nice capacity and can easily fit a small catalog, a retractable selfie stick, and much more.\n\nBecause this purse is soft and not structured, this makes a nice bag for traveling.

I absolutely love this bag. I have Coach, Antonio Melani, D&B, and other name brand and off brand bags and this one is probably one of my all time favorites.  The leather is just so soft with the ostrich look.  The stitching is superb.  It has slim pockets on either end that I can slide my iPhone 6 plus in to ensure I don't loss it in the abyss.  It has a large inside zippered pocket that fits all of my things but on the either side of that zippered pocket is another \"slot\" if you will for more things that you want to keep separate or maybe have easier access to.  The handles are just large enough that I can slide it over my shoulder and carry the bag just under my arm snuggly, or I can carry hanging down and just gripping the handles.  It has a great clasp that you must squeeze to release, or depress, but it is not obvious so it is just beautiful and not cumbersome looking.  I just absolutely cannot say enough good things about this bag, other than I wish it came in other colors because I would by different colors.  It has a large flat bottom so it sits nicely without falling over.  It has smaller sewn in pockets on the inside for glosses, lipsticks, etc.  I love the color. It is actually a neutral color and not really a bright yellow so it can go with just about anything.  Highly recommend this bag if you are in the market for a well made, beautiful bag.

The chains don't hang too long, in fact, you barely notice they're there when wearing them. You can adjust the clamp to fit your ear size. The clamp doesn't feel uncomfortable at all and it stays in place even when you shake your head around. I don't have anything negative to say about these. They're just the way I wanted them to be. :)", "summary": "Got here 2 weeks early! :D", "unixReviewTime": 1433808000}

I initially purchased this with my husband in mind, who is a guys 34. It seems that if you are a men's USA size 34 that this belt is the perfect fit length wise. If you are much bigger and it will most likely not fit nicely nor properly. I read about this before my purchase, so it was of no consequence to me. Always do your own research. I figured it would be to small for myself. It is one size. I personally think these could even be advertised as unisex. I have even worn this a couple of times, after confiscating it from my husband. We were on a small getaway and I had forgotten my own belt. I was pleasantly surprised that it fit me so well. The leather is soft. I have belts that cost small fortunes and this easily compares. Typically I would never say I would re-purchase, I like this belt that much, I plan to get us a few more in different colors. The package is some of the best I have ever had something arrive in. It is in a nice box with the label and gift-giving ready. I like to surprise my husband with gifts. He was desperately in need of a new quality leather belt. Wearing a side arm is the main reason that I only purchase him very good quality leather belts. My husband needs something to hold up those britches and a heavy sidearm. So far the cow hide leather belt has held up.\n\nThe belt buckle is a good metal end. The buckle is easily re-moved with a flat ended screwdriver. Once the buckle is detached from the leather strip, re-sized to your own measurements. If all you are needing is a new hole to make it tighter though, you can easily punch a new hole in the belt with the steel belt punching tool provided in the box. The company gives you a tool to make another hole. Be sure to use a cutting board or scrap piece of wood. You don't want to damage a nice table, dresser or coffee table etc. Measure to where you need the new hole, make a mark, set the tool to where you want the hole and hammer it like a nail. A hole to match the other punctures in the leather will be set into the leather. I already own a set of leather punches. This was the first time I ever received one with a belt. I did overlook that extra feature when I ordered. Overall my assessment is that the look of quality is there without the price tag, the softness is supple yet firm, I like the tool being included, the nice box, the leather smell, the buckle is nice looking and the belt is sturdy enough to hold up pants and a sidearm. I received this product at a discount in exchange for a review of my honest and unbiased opinion.", "summary": "A sturdy yet unassuming simple leather belt in dark brown", "unixReviewTime": 1459814400}

When I received it, however, I somewhat knew right away that it wouldn't work out. The top portion of the dress fit fine -- I'm not a really busty girl as it is (34 B), so the top wasn't an issue. However, as tried to even attempt to slide on the bottom half around my hips, it would not budge. Girls with bigger hips-- beware. Not to mention, the dress was super short as it is, so I'm not too sure how many women would be able to wear this comfortably anyway. As for the make -- it's, okay. Certainly not top-notch materiel, but it stays together. Looks like the pictures. I wish they carried an XL because that would perhaps fit me, but I guess I'm stuck with having to return the Large and leaving it at all. Overall, super poor fit, but really cute looking dress.
