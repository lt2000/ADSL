Crocs are popular in our household, though. We wear them all the time, in different colors and styles. It is more and more common to see athletes, particularly ones in high school, wearing Crocs in place of after-sport sandals (slides). I also know someone who wore them to the prom with a fairly formal dress. They're just fun and comfortable. They're a good substitute for sandals because you immediately eliminate the danger of stubbing your toes! Crocbands are a definite upgrade as far as comfort and style go.  They offer a little more support and have holes on the top but not the sides, which really cuts down on getting those little annoying pebbles in your shoes. The band around the bottom makes them look a little more like sneakers. Ordered these in Aquamarine, and they really look sharp. The price was very reasonable, less than half the cost they were in the store that sells Crocs at the mall.\n\nIf you believe Crocs are making a comeback or never even went out of style, these will be a cool addition to your footwear collection. They're great for running errands, going out to the garden or mailbox, something comfortable to wear after playing a sport, wearing to work or school, going to the prom, etc. etc. You are only limited by your own Croc boundaries!", "summary": "Crocs are the best!", "unixReviewTime": 1472860800}

Nautical prints are really on trend right now and with it being summer a sheer scarf is perfect. I order the scarf in grey with white anchors. It is an infinity style scarf which means that it is sewn together in an O shape. A single stitch was used to hem the edges as well as sew the ends together. The fabric is soft and more of a matte sheer which I like. Its light enough to wear in the summer, but has a look that is appropriate for the winter months as well. The scarf easily loops around my neck twice and still has plenty of room to drape. It is over 30 wide so it has good volume to it once on. Overall I am really pleased with this scarf.

And I do mean that literally. If you've ever had any clothes shipped to you from China or South Korea, you know what I'm talking about. The clothes often has a very \"fishy\", grimy, metallic odor when it's fresh out of the package, so the first thing I did after receiving this was put it through a wash (I hang my clothes to dry, though, so I can't say whether or not this would shrink in the dryer).\n\nI bought the Light Blue version of this shirt and in reality the shirt is actually much lighter than shown in the product photo (see my own pics, if they're visible).\n\nAs the title of my review states, this is actually a pretty nice shirt - fits exceptionally well and is cut slim - although it does betray its lower pricetag in a few ways:\n\n- First, the fabric isn't the greatest. That's not to say it's bad, it just isn't \"silk\" or something fancy like that. It's lightweight but not too thin, however it seems to wrinkle easily, and, like I said, the first thing I did was wash this so I doubt it's starch that's making it hold its creases so much. The wrinkling isn't horrible, just noticeable.\n\n- Second: loose strings...goodness there's SOOOO many of them! This can't be such a big complaint though, because, let's be serious, a pair of scissors can easily do away with these.\n\n- But I think that the biggest giveaway that this isn't a high-end garment is the grid-pattern print. The blurry photos had me thinking the grid pattern was woven into the cloth, but nope, it's printed. That wouldn't be so bad if they were tiny zig-zagged lines, however they're dots. And to me the dots are too big; I think just a tiny bit smaller and they would have looked better. Also, I was hoping they would be Navy, (which would look great on a Light Blue shirt) but I was wrong again; they're black. I'm pretty sure the dots are black on all three shirts.\n\nAnd lastly, a couple other things of relevance:\n- The shirt has a stiff collar instead of collar stays.\n- The buttons aren't flat against the shirt; they're sort of like tiny hot irons which hang off the shirt from the handle (see photos). Also, they're shiny and metallic, but are actually made of plastic.\n\nI almost wanna give this shirt 3 stars (the grid pattern really drags it down), but overall it's pretty nice for the price.", "summary": "Pretty nice shirt", "unixReviewTime": 1437955200}

However, I would say that it runs large and it's not real latex. I bought the \"9 steel bones in black\" one and it's made of neoprene. This will also make you sweat, but it advertises itself as latex so it is a bit of false advertising. However, you might prefer the neoprene if you have a latex allergy.\n\nI have an actual squeem faja and I'll include photos comparing the two. The squeem is shorter so it's better for shorter torsos, and it's actual latex. The squeem I have is in a size small. I ordered this one in a medium based off my measurements (I even ordered down) and it was still big on me. I also have am very squishable and have more adipose fat on my torso so I can squish down more than someone who is all muscle. That being said, this faja doesn't squish in so much as all around the body. It is very strong though and I like the multiple front adjustments and the neoprene makes you sweat a lot under it. It also has more bones in it than the squeem so I think it helps with your posture more.\nMy main takeaways are that it isn't latex when it states it's latex, but it's great for long torsos and does help with posture.", "summary": "Good for posture and long torsos--neoprene and NOT latex", "unixReviewTime": 1474848000}

I had never seen ties like this before, but I was intrigued and am not disappointed with the ties or their list price.\n\nI could not find the material of the ties, but it is not silk, the usual tie material, as far as I know.

Just a quick comment but otherwise the tie looks very sharp and is well made.\n\nWas not expecting these ties to look as nice as it is. Also I was not expecting it to be as well made such as having a bit of a lining where it wraps around the back of your neck. It also has a \"tie stay\" to keep the ends together..

I bought a Wilson's black rivet bag in distressed black leather with a sale code on their own website for $50 less and ended up with a nicer bag. My Floto Venezia, on the other hand, cost around $40 more than the Baigio but was of noticeably finer quality. Well worth the extra money. Nevertheless, my daughter saw the bag and fell for it, so I ended up not returning it. Here's the difference. The hardware is smaller and not of the same caliber as I'd expect at this price point. Second, the rivets are not gusseted, nor is the handle attached to a strap that runs down to the bottom. Time will tell if this leads to strap failure. Not a problem on other bags I've seen for less. The leather is a nicely colored reddish brown but has a slightly more \"painted\" look than my other reddish brown bags where more leather grain shines through. The Baigio arrived crushed to conserve packaging space. Even my Rustic Town Travel duffel at $139 arrived packed with filler to avoid creasing. As a result, the Baigio had deep creases. When the bag is less than maximally filled, the result is that some deep grooves spoil what should be a beautiful look and shape. Not quite cracks, but deep enough to think there may have been a defect. The bag should have been finished and dried and kept in shape with filler, then placed in a fleece bag like my Floto Venezia ($191), Rustic Town Distressed Brown Duffel ($139), and Leathario Duffel ($198 and a much bigger and nicer bag). Each had arrived in style, packed very nicely and in their own cloth bag to avoid marring. Alas, although the Baigio is not a bad bag, at this price point, it falls short on a number of key points. Simply put, does it hold clothes? Yes. Is it nicely lined. Yes, but not quite up to snuff. Does it look good? Yes, but not like its competitors. Will it last. Not sure without the reinforcements, gusseting or full length support straps.", "summary": "Not bad looking, but falls short compared to others in its price range.", "unixReviewTime": 1441756800}

Overall, it is definitely well worth the few dollars you'll pay for it. It keeps great time, and isn't that really the main function you want in a watch? If not, and looks is your main function, this watch surprisingly delivers there, too. From any distance, this watch could easily be mistaken for an actual expensive name-brand piece. It's a Chinese made watch, made with a quality Japanese Miyota movement. One thing I don't like is the uni-directional bezel. It's chrome-plated plastic (or at least, it feels and looks like it), only has 60-clicks, and worst of all, it is very loose. Once set, it reverse rotates a lot before being caught by the cog. It is loose, compared to any other rotating bezel I've owned or seen. The band is rolled flat steel. It has three adjuster holes (nice!) and a dual side-button release clasp. Nothing great, but certainly not a bad band. Better than most Chinese metal watch bands, that's for sure. It's even better than some metal bands I've seen on brands such as Fossil and Diesel. Luminous dial hands. The back states, \"Water Resistant,\" but does not show a rating. A little research shows 30m, but with a pop-on case back, I certainly wouldn't risk this watch in any water situation beyond light rain. For an inexpensive watch, this one is definitely higher quality than most Chinese-made pieces. It's heavier, thus feels a bit tougher, has a better band than most, has working day and date, and looks great. Just don't mistake this for a Seiko or a Citizen. It's not near that caliber of quality. But, for the price, you're definitley getting your money's worth.", "summary": "Worth the money. Higher quality than most Chinese-made watches.

Fortunately the price is so cheap as to be disposable so I don't mind.\n\nI would buy them again but I'd go up TWO SIZES from my US baseline in order to avoid blue B's.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wellsextoys-Mens-Swimming-Breif-Bikini-Shorts-Summer-Beach-Swimsuit-3-Colors-Green-L/dp/B0107TLF8Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wellsextoys Mens Swimming Breif Bikini Shorts Summer Beach Swimsuit 3 Colors (Green,L)</a>", "summary": "Small pouch, go up 2 sizes", "unixReviewTime": 1484265600}

I purchased two suits, one for my 2 year old son and one for my 8 month old daughter.  While I was hesitant about the high price tag, like many people, I am happy to pay for high quality, especially when it comes to my kids.\n\nWe recently used the swim suits for the first time. They were worn for about 45 minutes as our children played in a small splash pad in our front yard. Our son was standing up the whole time as we held our baby.  Both were wearing cloth reusable swim diapers underneath.  Upon taking the suits off I was highly disappointed to see that both suits looked visibly damaged/worn. The fabric looks very snagged, pilled, and in horrible condition.\n\nPer the company who makes them, the \"silky\" fabric does damage easily if it comes into contact with any rough surfaces, and they are looking into finding a resolution to this issue.  Our suits did not have any contact with anything rough, were worn for less than one hour, and were still in terrible shape.\n\nNot sure if this is the case, but I know some companies can slap a \"made in USA\" tag on an item even if 99% of it is made overseas. Kinda a dirty trick, but it definitely happens. Not sure if that is what is going on in this instance, but this product absolutely did not impress us. Atleast if it had been made in a different country and was of this quality, hopefully it would have cost a lot less.\n\nLuckily Amazon is willing to give us our money back even though I discarded the original packaging/ tags as I initially had no intention of returning them. Had I written my review before actually using them, it likely would have been 5 stars.  We loved the fit and coverage that these suits provide. The fabric issue is a deal breaker. Anything involving kids just has to be made more durable. If not, it definitely has to cost significantly less than this product.\n\nHope this info is helpful to other potential customers.\n\nAttached is a picture for reference.", "summary": "Not worth the hefty price tag", "unixReviewTime": 1498262400}

I was worried that it would be too big or bulky, but when I put it on and wore it around the house, I found that my fears were warrantless.\nFirst of all, the ring comes in a small red cloth bag. The band looks antique with some intricate detailing. The stones are firmly placed in the settings and are beautiful.  Aiyaya & CO offers a full-3Year warranty covering manufacturing and material defects which supports how well made this ring is.\nSecond, the ring is not too heavy or bulky for me.  I have been able to wear it around the house without banging it on anything.  Matter of fact, I am typing while wearing it. I ordered a size 7 and it is a perfect fit. There is no sliding or slipping.\nThis ring is really gorgeous.  I am so glad that I was able to order it.  I definitely recommend it.  Buy it; you will not regret it.\nThis product was provided at a discounted price or free in exchange for my honest review.

I have a rather small back and ribcage, with most bras being too loose around the band. So I ordered the small size of these bras because they say to order same size as pre pregnancy. And I figured since since I sometimes wear xs, a small was already a size up in theory.\n\nI'd say the ribcage fits well and can even be loosened a row.  The cups are very streachy and first trimester they fit pretty well and helped reduce tenderness. They were so much more comfortable than my old underwires. Now I'm 6 months peegnant and the cups are decidedly too small, even with the insert removed. I'm not quite sure what cup size I am currently, but I'm thinking I'm well over DDD. I think perhaps 6 months post partum, these will fit again.\nI'm going to get these in a medium because I liked the smalls so much.

They might run or come off if you get extremely sweaty or wet. Mine was completely dry and came off after a few moments under running water with no soap. It washed clean away and did not stain my skin.\nThese are fun on skin, but you can also paint a canvas or poster board and create your own glowing art work or black light poster. Great activity for kids! It doesn't take a whole lot to create a nice design. I recommend using a paint palette or a coated paper plate and squeezing out a drop or two of the colors you want to use. That will help you to not waste as much of this cool paint.\nI can see this being really fun for Halloween! Paint on a design, streak your hair or make your own mask and carry a black light flashlight to shine onto your design when you want to glow!\nThese paints are non-toxic, safe for skin, hair, nails, etc. They are eco-friendly and cruelty free. I painted very close to my eyes, which I would have left a little more space if I had been putting it on a child, but it washes away very easily with warm water if you or your little one happen to get it in your eyes.\nI am very pleased with the quality of these paints an the glow is phenomenal!

My grandson and his mom and dad are going on a black light fun run in the fall and this will be perfect for them to all three paint up their bodies and clothes.\n\nThere is plenty paint in these bottles for a LOT of painting. Today my grandson came over to \"test\" the paints. It was a fun summer activity. He used less that 1/4 oz combined in all the colors he used. In fact, if we hadn't removed the paper seals on the inside the lid top of the bottles, you wouldn't know he used any at all. I like that it is non-toxic and that even if he had gotten some in his eye (not recommended) it could have been washed out and it wouldn't have injured him.\n\nI like that I can use it to decorate things around my back yard for a party and it will wash out the next time it rains and won't hurt the grass. I don't have any black lights out there, but the neon paint will show up nicely before dark. Actually, he did get a bit on the fabric of the chair in which he was sitting. No problem, though. I took a wet rag and it came out like it was never there.\n\nThe next time he comes over, he wants me to print out some of the stencils that came free as an ebook so he can use them to make some cool designs. That means he will have another fun, fun time at his grandma's.\n\nOne other thing, I'm proud that it is made in the US and that it hasn't been tested on any \"unwilling participants\".\n\nI was fortunate to receive this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST & UNBIASED opinion.

It comes with 6 vibrant colors that are very attractive and fun to play with. I have been using these paints with kids and they love it.\n\nThese paints are body safe so allowing them to us it on their hands is not a problem. These paints can be used for sensory activities as well as painting. The colors are really nice and pleasing to the eyes. The kids enjoy working with tempera paint. The texture is a little thinner then acrylics and really easy to work with. It can be used both as a finger paint or with a paint brush.

Poshsquare has come up with the perfect solution!\n\nI pair this Poshsquare fashion midi-length open-back dress with a light weight shrug and low heels during the day  the modest turtle neck front and midi length offer an elegant and business-appropriate look. After work I take off the shrug and slip on a pair of high boots and Ive got a classy evening look with sexy details. The form fitting top hugs curves and the open back is a delightfully sexy surprise.\n\nThe quality of this midi-length dress is apparent in the tight even stitches, the well-finished seams, and the soft flawless material. The dress is exceptionally comfortable and easy to wear with a soft defined waist, no buttons, no zippers, and no fussiness.\n\nI ordered this versatile dress in Navy, size medium, at a promotional cost in exchange for an unbiased review and love the incredible versatility. The length is perfect for me  Im 54 and l love that this dress hits mid-calf.

I did find it a bit sheer (the top part, specifically) so I wore a slim tank (of a different color since the back is open) for extra coverage.

This great looking bag has both,the retro and the vintage looks! Prior to getting into details about the bag,would like to shed some light on the origins of retro and vintage:\nRetro: The word retro derives from the Latin prefix retro, meaning backwards, or in past times in other words, Retro style is an outdated style or fashion that has become fashionable again.\nVintage: The term Vintage relates primarily to wine and is an altered form of the French word vendage, meaning the grapes picked during a season. And according to Wikipedia, Vintage items are not as old as Antiques, yet has to be at least twenty years old! And the best Vintage is items from the forties and fifties.\n\nCraftsmanship:\n---------------------\nGreat looking bag,that can be used by both,males and females! It is made out of quality cow leather. Color is an impressive dark brown,which gives it that old leather look! no picture or video will show the real color of the this bag! In person the bag is completely different in quality and look!! Stitching is really made to last,as it is made with nylon threading,which most likely to outlast the rest of the bag,while keeping it together. Heavy duty zippers,and I like the fact that the main zipper is made in two parts,which gives you the advantage of unzipping one side at a time. Handle is also two parts that is rounded leather to give that extra strength,and joint by a leather flap. Shoulder strap is mainly leather and some durable canvas,with a nice size leather padding. Size is decent,as you can see in my pictures bellow,I was able to fit my 13\" laptop comfortably inside the bag with some room to spare. Lining is average,with some padding to protect fragile gadgets inside. Two compartments,with a small zipper pocket,and a couple of pockets for smaller objects such as a phone or pencils.\nHardware is made out of brass like metal,fit for such a higher quality product!\n\nConclusion:\n----------------\nHave had this bag for a couple of weeks already,and up to this moment,I can't really find anything negative that would prevent me from giving it the deserving five star rating! Superior quality is written all over this bag! Purchase it and I promise you,not to regret such purchase! It can be used for business or pleasure. Still, if you're a skeptical person and not sure whether to trust other people's reviews or not! With Amazon's 30 day return policy, you have four weeks to try it out yourself, before returning it for any reason, with no questions asked, and in most cases Amazon will pay for the return shipping, in other words, it is a win, win situation!! With that said, I hope you find my humble opinion helpful in making or breaking your buying decision, if so please return the favor by hitting the YES button bellow while you're at it :)", "summary": "Elegance while keeping a professional look!", "unixReviewTime": 1465084800}

My wrists are larger and I have issues with most standard size bracelets but was able to wear this one just fine.\n\nI like that is states that is was made in the USA and by hand. The charms are solid and are well made. There are no rough edges or places that will catch or snag on clothing.\n\nAccording to the packaging, the company donates a portion of the sale of this item to the American Cancer Society. That is nice and helps to encourage purchases as a way of supporting this cause.\n\nI have not had any issues with the bracelet turning color or coloring my wrist. The packaging indicates that the wire is made with tarnish resistant 14 gauge wire which is strong enough to hold up to daily wearing.\n\nOverall, I am happy with my bracelet and have enjoyed wearing it.\n\nIf you have any questions about my experience please leave me a comment.

Alex and Ani does not make one so I didn't think I would be able to buy her one.\n\nThen I found this one. Now it is not the same high quality as an Alex and Ani but it also costs a fraction of the price. This bracelet is nice and it is for an important cause to our family. I really liked the fact that it was made in the USA, by hand. I also like that a portion of the proceeds go to the American Cancer Society. It is awesome that this bracelet is offered for 17 types of cancer and one general cancer awareness one.\n\nThe only real issue my wife had with this bracelet is the fact that it is really large. Because she has really skinny wrists and arms the bangle slides half way down her arm. Looking at the bright side, it won't get tangles with her other bangles.\n\n I purchased this bangle bracelet for a discounted price for my unbiased review and honest opinion.

I read about the concept in a magazine.  If she decides to give away any of those \"gifts\" (she chooses what her own gifts are for herself, ex.first kiss) & if she decides to give it away before the time frame she decides upon (upon engagement, at the altar, etc.) then she is supposed to give that charm to the one she would give her gift to.  It is a wonderful reminder to help a young woman keep her eye on the prize when temptation may arise.  Our daughter loved the idea when she read about it & so I just surprised her with her bracelet now that she is a teen and will face more temptation as she gets older.\n\nI LOVE that these bracelets are adjustable to fit pretty much any wrist.  The charms are pretty, well cut (no rough spots), the text is centered on them, & they are super cute.  I'm sure some people may not care for two of the charms that came on mine (\"handmade with love\" is on one charm & \"Made in the USA\" is on the other charm.. I think they are both super cute charms & emphasize that they are handmade.  My daughter also likes them.) but they could be removed if desired.  We are leaving them on the bracelet because we like them in addition to the clear bead charm & the \"Believe\" charm.\n\nI think this makes a wonderful gift & I do recommend it.\n\nIn fact we like them so much I just purchased another one at full retail as a gift because we do like it so much.  I will buy more for my other daughters in the future & also some as gifts for my girls' best friends when their birthdays come around.\n\nI received a discount on this product for the purpose of my honest review, but as I said I like them so much I have already ordered another one & will order more.\n\nDon't worry, I have integrity & do NOT lie in my reviews whether I paid full price or received a discount!\n\nI USED TO think that people who received discounts on reviewed products were all dishonest just trying to get freebies or cheap products for writing fluff-filled reviews whether they actually liked the product or not, but I have since found out how things work and I mostly disagree with that now. I can't say that some people don't do that, but I can say that my experience has been a good one & the way I find products is I look for things I NEED & WANT, so I almost always have knowledge about them before ordering something. If it is the first time I've used a certain product I disclose that also in my review. That knowledge gives me some advantage in writing my reviews because I know what to look for in a product, how it may compare to others, etc. & then I can write a fair, honest, & hopefully helpful review!\n\nI know that Amazon reviews are helpful & so many people look at them to decide if they should purchase a product. I also know seeing so many reviews from certain products that seem like they are all from discounts or freebies can be deeply discouraging. Take heart & know that my experience has been that many of the reviewers genuinely want to give you a fair & honest review. Again, there are some who use a product once or twice & then write a glowing review, but I'm not talking about them. I'm talking about those who take the time to THOROUGHLY test a product before writing a review. They don't write reviews after 3 days of receiving a product just because someone may want them to pound out a bunch of reviews in 72 hours.\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions. I will do my best to follow up if you do.\n\nIf you found my review candid & helpful, please click on the YES button below.\n\nThank you!", "summary": "Was cute but NOW TARNISHED!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1460851200}

I ordered the \"Believe' charms which included an oval shaped charm that says \"Believe\", a clear bead charm, a round charm with a floral print and a heart charm that says \"Made in the USA.\"  I did have to tighten the hoops that hold the charms onto the bracelet for fear they would come off.  On some of the other reviews I noticed people receiving 5 charms on their bracelets where I received 4.  Maybe it depends on which one you order? One thing I found interesting is that in the item description it highlights that it \"COMES IN A GIFT BOX!\"  Like this is the very best part of the bracelet purchase.  It came with a plain white box and a plastic lid, nothing fancy at all and in fact it looked rather cheap. It is a pretty bracelet, looks very dainty and would make a nice for a younger sister or friend.  I can't really picture an older woman wearing this bracelet because the charms are a little whimsical and might not look the same on a more mature woman.  I'm not sure it would be able to stretch wide enough to fit over a larger hand.  It would have been nice to have received a piece of paper or note saying \"Thank you for purchasing our product, we appreciate your business\" but it came with nothing other than the not so fabulous gift box. I did receive this bracelet at a discount in exchange for an unbiased and honest review which I have given.  I take the reviews on Amazon seriously and I hope mine helped in your buying decision.", "summary": "It's a nice bracelet with a few flaws", "unixReviewTime": 1459814400}

By the way, those are just textured plastic - NOT going to absorb essential oils like the product description claims. This mix-up is honestly not a big deal, but worth noting.\n\nWhat I don't like is that the bracelet is too loose. I definitely don't have skinny wrists but this thing dangles and moves every time I change the position of my arm. Its far too big, and distracting every time it shifts around. It also occasionally causes the hairs on my arm to get pinched and pulled.\n\nThe other real problem is the cheap plastic holding the bracelet together. Its inevitably going to break, probably sooner than later. See for yourself in the picture.\n\nThe only reason I give two stars instead of one is because the beads ARE pretty. I would have been satisfied with this bracelet if it fit correctly and was made to last longer. I may at least repurpose the beads, eventually.\n\nEven if you're not planning to get this exact style, I still highly recommend not looking here for a pride bracelet.

A cool feature of this headband is that it has a pocket in the back of it which is big enough to fit a house key, some money and an I.D. So that is a pretty nifty feature. This seems to absorb sweat pretty well too which is what I bought it for, to keep the sweat from getting in my eyes and also keep my hair from flying around. This does both pretty well. One thing I don't like and this is why I gave it a 4 star rating, is because I'm not a fan of the name. Now on here the name of the company is Runbreeze and that's the name they have on the headband as well. But beware because that is not what on this headband. They must have changed it because it now says Runderwear. Which is my opinion is utterly stupid and does not sound good at all. RunBreeze was a million times better I think. Now this is not a big deal to me at all really, but I feel like some people would probably want to know that this is a little bit of false advertising. So all together this is a nice headband, it works well for what it is suppose to do and it is also comfortable, overall I give it 4 stars and would recommend it.\n\nI received this product at a discount or for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.

After the first few minutes though I did forget about it.  All in all, I am very happy with this purchase.  It kept my hair back, kept me cool and was easy on my head (no residual headaches, etc).  I will be purchasing more in the future.\n\nFull Disclosure: This item was supplied to me for a reduced cost by the seller to use and evaluate it for their customers. I was not told what to write, nor was I asked to give it a certain rating, nor was I influenced by any party. I don't remove a negative or lower star review at the sellers request, nor will I hold back from posting a 1, 2 or 3 star rating if I find that the item deserves it.

Since this is basically supposed to be one size fits all I was expecting it to be stretchy in ALL the pieces. But I'd say only the tights were closest to be one size fits all.\n\nThe g-string didn't have any elasticity at all, which surprised because even underwear typically has very forgiving and stretchy elastic to allow for different shapes and sizes but this g-string definitely is NOT stretchy. Which also means if your butt and hips are not perfectly prioportioned for this size g-string it will either sag and have extra butt string hanging because you don't have enough to fill it out or the string on your hips will be very tight and unflattering and give you horrible muffin top and then the lace stretched out and doesn't even lay right anymore so it just looks really bad. I would recommend to the manufacturer that they make the g-string more stretchy so it can truly be a one size fits all and and if not at least write down the exact measurements of have to be in order for this to fit appropriately.\n\nMoving on to the top. Again this would be super cute and sexy...if it fit right. I managed to get it on but i don't think it was quite big enough and I'm not even what you would consider heavy. I've actually lost a lot of weight and would be considered more slim than anything. I mean I'm not incredibly toned and skinny but definitely not fluffy at all anymore. So anyways, the second I tried to put this on I quickly realized the strings needed to be relaxed and tied because they weren't laced properly and they weren't tied so everything came undone. This led me to my second discovery. The top doesn't have specifically made spots for you to lace the ribbon, you literally have to wedge it through the lace and stretch the crap out of the lace edging which means this will NOT last a long time at all before he lace edging rips. Also because there's no specific spots for the lace to be threaded through it made it hard to figure out where and how to lace the ribbon. The whole process took a very long time (try upwards of 10-15 minutes) and was incredibly frustrating just having to write about it is irritating because it felt like such a waste of time.\n\nOnce I got it on it was okay but for all the time and trouble I went through it didn't seem worth it to me.\n\nThen comes the next part. Putting on the tights and then snapping the top onto the tights. At first I thought the tights weren't big enough but if you have some patience you can stretch them up to fit but then your next problem is the fit of top of each stocking. It (like the g-string) is not stretchy AT ALL and really makes you look super fat unless you are the exact measurements meant for this outfit. Which seems to me probably like size 0-5.\n\nAs for the snaps they're made of a combo of clear rubber and a flexible plastic/rubber that goes over the top. You push the clear rubber down and it pops out of the plastic loop. This part wasn't too hard. What was hard was trying to get the string of the top to reach down to the stocking while simultaneously holding both in place AND trying to get the snap to snap on. I did it though! Once I finished it didn't look too bad. But I didn't feel super sexy in it generally speaking because the overall fit was very bad. I did however manage to make the most of the situation and got some really good pictures out of it but considering the amount of time and hassle it took to get the dang thing on and the poor fit I would NOT recommend this product and it definitely would not work if you're trying to quickly \"slip into something sexy\" there is nothing quick about this and the fit isn't very sexy.\n\nIf they can fix the fit of this outfit and fix the quality then I'd definitely recommend this and love it but right now as it is I would not recommend this or buy it again.\n\nI received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.\n\nThe measurements in the photos I shared are of the crotch of the g-string. One is the straight down length and the other is the diagonal length of the crotch.\n\nThe close up of the lace is of the g-string to show its a raw edge that will fray and easily tear.\n\nI also included a side view of the top so you can see that the lacing goes through the side lace edge and pulls really badly on the top. Even if it did fit perfect or at least better because the ribbon goes through the lace edging it would still ruin the top and as a result makes this poor quality and won't last long at all.", "summary": "Cute idea but really lacking in quality", "unixReviewTime": 1462665600}

It is a sexy outfit but it is also one time use (or if you are careful then maybe two) because of the quality. Also since this is a one size fits most kind of item then do not expect it to fit overly well and certainly very far from a perfect fit. I would say it fits well anyone from a size small (or xs) to a size medium, but not larger sizes. While the top you can adjust, the bottom underwear is not that stretchy. I will go through a few details:\n\n-The top is nice but do note that the garter straps are only in front, none in the back. Also the tie strings on the sides do not come tied like they are shown in the picture, rather they are tied wider apart so if you wish to re-tie them it is not so convenient and may take a while to get the thin string through the tiny lace holes. One good thing is the top shoulder straps are adjustable.\n\n-The g-string bottom is not appropriately sized since the vertical string is way too long (may need to make a knot of it at the top) while the horizontal band may run snug. And the triangular lace part is XXXS, not as pictured in the description photos.\n\n- The stockings are probably the best piece out of this set of three, they feel a bit more durable. Although the lace around the top of them is extremely thin and will likely just roll into a line for you also.\n\nI had received this product at a slight discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. So I do hope you find my review helpful in your purchasing decisions. One last piece of advice, if this outfit survives and will need to get washed then I highly recommend air drying it... do not put it in the heat dryer!", "summary": "It is okay, sexy-looking but poor quality and a mediocre fit.", "unixReviewTime": 1461542400}

Smart choices, that will lead to a long lasting, classic wardrobe, with minimal wasted money.\n\nI had to explain that, to explain that I was unsure about this dress. I was waffling between a 6.5 and a 7. In the photo, the top (with the black buttons) seems to make up a third of the dress and be a much larger portion that the top of my size 12. As a result, I was left more conflicted (as I'd liked the photo), and it was my boyfriend who really convinced me that he really liked it (he doesn't like anything. Everything is \"it's ok\"), so I kept it. I bought this to be able to wear to work - it's a color I love and it's visually interesting. The darts do have the potential to sit a bit high on my 'lady lumps', but I moved around when trying this on, and it wasn't a big problem. I also didn't realize from the photos, it comes with a belt. I may or may not use it.\n\nSo I like the dress, but I'm not yet in love with it, and I will try and post photos of me in it once I get a chance to wear for comparison. For reference, I ordered an 12, as I am 5'4 but very busty with an hourglass shape. It's a nice fabric, a bit stretchy (so the bottom doesn't seem voluminous in comparison to the top), but not clingy so that I feel I need Spanx or something. I would recommend this to someone else, as I think it's a cute dress and worth giving a shot.\n\nI washed this in a delicates bag, by itself, on our delicates cycle (we don't have a hand wash or a wool cycle), using the Forever New washing powder (only thing I use on delicates/bras/handwash items), and lay it flat to dry on a drying rack.

That said, it took some manipulating to get them to bend into the frame.  I was very frustrated by the time I finally got the lense into the frame.  However, once I got it into the frame, it tightened down over the lense and fit nicely.  The lenses do not say RayBan on them like the lenses from the factory.  If you are a purist like myself, you'll feel strange wearing them and feel a need to explain to people the situation of why the lenses don't say RayBan, and want to explain that the glasses are actually RayBans and not knock offs.  Then you'll want to curse RayBan for not stocking the lenses!\n\nSo... I digress.  The lenses are fine. They fit good.

Two zippered ones and one in between the two zippered ones that closes with a magnetic snap closure.  Each compartment is easy to reach and the zippers are strong.  The lining a silk-like material and appears durable and strong.\n\nThe part I was most disappointed about is the strap.  You would think a bag of this quality would have a shoulder strap to match the bag.  I was disappointed with the fabric material of the strap and was surprised it was not made of full leather like the rest of the bag.  I also thought the strap was a little short (but then, I am 5'10\" and prefer longer shoulder straps so I can wear it cross body).\n\nDespite it's short comings I still rate this bag 5 stars.  I was debating between a 4 and a 5 star, but then decided my issue with the shoulder strap is a minor one and one that many would disagree with.  As such I figured 5 stars probably better reflects the quality of the bag.\n\nI received a free sample of this bag in exchange for my review.", "summary": "Beautiful!", "unixReviewTime": 1450483200}

The bag has three compartments so I put the charger, mouse, mouse pad and my earphones inside the second one that comes with the zipper and inside the one in the middle that closes with a magnetic clip I put my wallet, keys and phone for easy access.\nI really am ecstatic about the bag and let me tell you something I normally never talk about but that is a big part of my life. I suffered from hemiplegia I suffered partial loss of movement in my left arm and leg (I can walk but I can't use my hand) so closing some zippers requires using my teeth to aid my right hand which is why I would usually left my others bags unzipped so I could reach everything inside easily, but there was always the risk of something falling and getting lost or damage; that is not happening anymore with this bag I can close the zippers in the Yahoho bag with just one hand and there is no risk of nothing  falling from the middle compartment it closes automatically, and I can still reach everything I need in no time.\n\nThe seller was awesome as well they send it right on time and it came inside a fabric bag and bubble wrap over it, for protection, they really fulfill my every expectation. I might buy the other three in every color.\n\nThank you so much.", "summary": "It took me like forever to decide about what bag I should buy ...", "unixReviewTime": 1444003200}

It is GORGEOUS.  The quality is great.  It arrived as promised and I loved it--right up until I tried it on.  It came out of the packaging such a mess (as expected when buying by mail) that I had to spend 2 hrs steaming it out before I could even try it on--but that was my choice to buy this way and to save that money by steaming it myself and avoiding store overhead.  The dress, again, is GORGEOUS.  The problem?  The cut!  From the waist down, it fit me beautifully--but from the waist up--it was a DISASTER.  If I placed it such that the built in bra cups were on the bustline, then the shoulders of the garment rose 4\" above my shoulders.  If I dropped it down onto my actual shoulders, then the bra cups were at my waist and the waist was somewhere on my thighs.  It took me a while but I FINALLY figured out the issue.  This dress is made for a VERY VERY large bustline.  The 24W could easily accommodate a EEE.  Without the EEE's....its like the grand canyon inside this dress for anyone with a smaller bustline. So--to wrap up, if you have a very large bustline--order this dress in your regular USA women's size based on the chart on their page.  If you DO NOT have a very large bustline, either prepare for extensive and EXPENSIVE alterations or skip this one and move on.  I was hugely disappointed that this dress did not work for me, but the dress itself is beautiful once steamed and pressed.<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Grace-Karin-Women-s-Black-Tulle-Embroidery-Half-Sleeve-Long-Formal-Prom-Dresses-24W/dp/B010PP5KN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Grace Karin Women's Black Tulle Embroidery Half Sleeve Long Formal Prom Dresses (24W)</a>", "summary": "Great Quality, Poor Cut, HUGE in the BUSTLINE but GORGEOUS DRESS!", "unixReviewTime": 1447286400}

Not only would it be great to seem like you have a short haircut underneath a hat or turban, but if it matches your hair color (if you currently have any), then it can be paired with a pony tail for a sporty bang look, (of course, if you attach it to a headband, or have a way to Velcro bangs into a headband.)\n\nPros;\nIt works as advertised.  This is just the hair attached to Velcro, NOT hair attached to a headband, or hair attached to a hat.  However, instead of having different hats with different hair colors, you can just exchange the hair color as much as you would like.\nIt arrived on time, and seems to be brand new.\nThe length of the hair is uniform, and the color is even throughout.\nThere were not any loose hairs in my product.\nCons;\nIt is hard to match hair color exactly.\nThe bangs to not go ear to ear, instead, they go from one side of your forehead to another.  I would measure your face to see exactly how long it really is.\n\nIf you thought this was helpful, please say so by clicking the button! I would really appreciate helping more people.\n\nDisclaimer; I received this product at a discounted or reduced rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. I am given no compensation for a positive review, and I suffer no repercussions for a negative review, so all statements have no reason to be false or inaccurate.

Doctors quickly diagnosed her with Alopecia areata, which is when a person's immune system mistakenly attacks their hair follicles and causes hair loss. To encourage her to come out more without feeling so self-conscious about her hair, I ordered her the Fringe Bangs for Headwear by Cardani as well as the Instant Hair Headband by Headcovers Unlimited.\n\nWhen the bangs arrived, I was surprised just how realistic they looked. The hair fibers are thin and look exactly like real hair. They even move like real hair. The bangs are a little over seven inches wide and two and a half inches long. They sit nicely on my friend's head, and the blend of colors give it a very natural appearance. My friend has commented on how the bangs feel light and do not scratch or irritate her skin. She really likes wearing them.\n\nThese bangs are great for anyone who has experienced hair loss for a medical reason. My friend has alopecia but they would be just as suitable for someone with hair loss from chemotherapy or any other condition.  They can also be worn by those who just want to change their look for a day, and wish to have bangs without committing to them long term.\n\nJust to be clear, when ordering this item, you are only receiving the bangs, not the headband as well. You need to order the headband separately. I am very happy with the bangs, and my friend is absolutely thrilled with them. They make her feel much more confident to leave the house and socialize without worrying about people staring at her hair. I definitely recommend these bangs to anyone in the market for them.\n\nI must disclose that this product was received at a discounted cost for my honest and unbiased review. My opinion was not altered due to the product being discounted. If I do not believe in a product, I will not give it a positive rating. Please leave a comment if you have any further questions.

In short, this wallet has enough room that she can include the smart key for our Toyota in the change purse and slide her iPhone 6 into one of the bill sections and still clasp the wallet closed with the magnetic flap securely.  The pop out wristlet make it easier to hold on to.\n\nThis wallet is well made and looks great.  The leather is soft and the design on the fabric is very nice.  This wallet looks good by itself, in her larger red Coach purse, and also in her less formal \"sport\" bags she grabs for quick on the go trips.  When I started looking for a wallet for her I did not know how hard it would be to find something tasteful and utilitarian, and I was glad to find this HOBO wallet.

Their not too bad, but I probably won't be wearing them often or when I do i'll wear sheer black tights underneath to avoid over spill. Other than my own mistake, these are cute. Their long enough, came exactly as pictured, and arrived quickly. More low rise than I was anticipating, I'm 5'7 with a curvier build and I find myself having to pull these up all the time because my butt is too big. Again, my own mistake for not ordering another size up. They would probably fit fine if I was shaped with a more average build or flatter bottom. This a common problem with all my jeans.

I love these socks as they don't ride up too high so my calves can breathe and they are thinner than some of Nike's other performance socks. Despite that, they still have great cushioning as Nike makes them somewhat denser without sacrificing breathability. I've bought these socks before and was so impressed about how long they lasted and kept their form. They are quite possibly my favorite socks I have ever owned. I hope they don't run out soon as I'd like to buy another set in the near future.", "summary": "Extremely fast shipping, my favorite socks!!", "unixReviewTime": 1528416000}

My skin tone resembles boiled chicken in its undisturbed state and I always thought that was unattractive until skin cancer became a real fear in my world.  Now, swimming or lounging cannot be done without being slathered in sunscreen, but thanks to my glorious pigmentation, it doesn't always help 100%.  I started wearing Rashguards after one particularly bad burn I received while on a cruise to the Caribbean and haven't been without one since.  This rashguard is now my absolute favorites because of its versatility.  The adjustable strings make it less than a cover-up and more of a total package.  It's easy to go straight from the pool in your swim shirt to grab a quick bite to eat in your full covered dress.  I got so many compliments on this shirt while on the beach this summer and was told by all that liked it that the front zipper was the most attractive feature!  It is something that sets it apart from the other items like it and I think it should definitely be seen as a key selling feature.  I purchased the beautiful purple top and it compliments all of my bathing suits, no matter what their color.  This material is meant to cling to the body and is very true to size if that is how it's intended to be worn.

So, I checked out Amazon (Really, is there anywhere else to go?), and I found this adorable little belt. I ordered one to start to see if my idea was feasible. It was, and I ordered a second one. Now I have a pair of $25 boots that used to be plain but are now all fancy with their new braided leather wrap with tassels! Depending on the boot, you may find the belt too long.

I've been doing it the latter way because it's more versatile, you can hold both sides evenly for a short over the shoulder or crook of the arm look, or pull one side all the way out and leave the short end tight around the back of the bag to keep it long.

There is no \"texture\" to the fabric, and it doesn't have the \"hand\" or drape of a linen/cotton blend.

The top is a bit loose but that is due to my personal body type, and can be adjusted with tying the strings a little tighter. The fabric used seems to be quite durable, but as with any bikini, I reccomend hand washing so you don't get those little fuzzies from the washing machine. Not sure this one would, but I like it so much I'm not going to try and find out. The little tie in between the padded cups on the top does not come untied, it's sewn to look that way. So no fear of accidental exposure on the beach! The bottoms are so cute with a scrunched detail, which helps hide any imperfections you may have... (muffin top, perhaps?)... I've had three kids so this works wonders for me. :) I am very pleased with this bikini and the only thing I would change would be the option to order different size bottoms than top.

The retro attraction of the bright red halter top over dark blue and white polka dotted bottoms will have you looking good and catching everyones eyes. I am a mother, so I have a tummy covered in stretch marks, this high waist suit covers them all! For a long time I thought my only swim wear options were tee shirts over bikinis or full one pieces. Another great thing is the ruffled front on the bottom piece, it makes you look thinner and hides the little fat pouches around your tummy by making them look nonexistent. My size measurements are a 36b on top, and a 42in hip span at my widest point with a 27in in my midsection, Im 58 and 125lbs. I ordered a size large swimsuit thinking I needed one big enough to get over my giant birthing hips, and because I often have to order sports bras in large to fit comfortably on my rib cage, and because I feel safer ordering the next size up when ordering online. I will tell you, this suit is incredibly true to size. My poor top half was swimming around in empty cup space, so I will need to reorder next summer or find a new top to swap out until I can grow. The lower half fit great though, and is incredibly stretchy, I expect to be able to wear it even if a few months pregnant, due to how elastic it is. Upon receiving the swimsuit I promptly put it on, and uploaded photos to my Facebook, within minutes of having posted I had several likes, questions on where I got it, and one friend even ordered one for herself on the spot! This swimsuit is hot, and will give you some great confidence boosting attention when in use. Retro is very much in fashion, and this suit looks like a timeless art piece.

All of it was beautiful, great quality, fit perfectly, and priced well.  I loved everything I received, over 100 jewelry pieces, rings, earrings, necklaces, bracelets.  I wear it too.  I get compliments on all of it.  Some of the pieces are for evening wear, so I can't wear it to work.  I did not have to return a thing.  Well, that's why I work.

The next thing I know I was pulling out my VISA credit card and charging it up.  My problem was not that the individual pieces I was purchasing were expensive, because they were NOT.  My problem was that I could not stop buying jewelry.  After I submitted my $800 plus order, I thought \"WHAT HAVE I JUST DONE?\"  I had not seen the jewelry in person, nor had I known the brands, nor had I known the quality or the size, etc., etc. and I panicked.  Well, it was done.  So, I waited for my order.  My order came in partial orders, because the jewelry was coming from different vendors / stores.  However, when the orders came in, and I opened the package and saw my jewelry.....all of it......I was so pleasantly surprised.  All of it was beautiful, great quality, fit perfectly, and priced well.  I loved everything I received, over 100 jewelry pieces, rings, earrings, necklaces, bracelets.  I wear it too.  I get compliments on all of it.  Some of the pieces are for evening wear, so I can't wear it to work.  I did not have to return a thing.  Well, that's why I work.  I work to pay my bills, but also to enjoy things I can buy.  Amazon is good about returns and refunding your money, so I wasn't too worried.

It came in a nice silver gift box with a bow, the necklace is nicely placed inside without  it being tangled or damaged. There was no pieces missing (everything is intact). The necklace looked exactly like the stock photo.\n\nBecause of how big the necklace is I don't hang it up with my others, I keep it stored in the box it came in.\n\nThe necklace is made of base metal and three layers of white plated, nickle free and tarnish free, and a lobster clasp hook for a comfort fit.\n\nThis looks absolutely amazing with a solid color shirt and either leggins or dark color skinny jeans and either heels or knee high boots this is what makes the necklace pop.\n\nI have received many compliments on this necklace from me trying it on to just having it sitting in the box. Everyone ask where I got it from.\n\nI highly recommend this necklace for either yourself, or for someone as a gift for a bridal shower, prom, birthday. The price is reasonably priced.

Nice and stretchy, but with good snap-back. Would fit larger breasts and band sizes, though I'm not sure how much larger.\n\nThe tag is incredibly itchy and irritating, so I removed that. But it was sewn on with a clear plastic thread that continued to scratch at me until I managed to remove that as well. It isn't just annoying, it rubbed skin off and gave me a small rash. Once gone, however, the bra feels wonderful to wear.\n\nThe padding in the cups is thicker and more stiff than I expected, which is a bummer. My boyfriend was hoping for softer on me, definitely. But they do give me a nice rounded shape without looking unnatural, and give my bust a bit of a boost without making them rock hard. Plus, these bras provide all the support I need.\n\nI do wish the straps were further apart in the front, though. The plunge is JUST low enough to hide beneath most of my shirts, but the top of the cups show often. Too much front coverage is a common bra issue for me.\n\nMy biggest issue with these bras though, aside from the tag fiasco, is the packaging. They arrived bound together so tightly that the straps left permanent indentations in the cups! Being that I was going for seamless, this seriously bums me out. It isn't terribly noticeable, but it really irks me. Not enough not to wear them, I guess, but come on.\n\nAll in all, I am very glad I bought these. I am not kidding when I say they are unbelievably comfortable! I don't think I'll ever wear underwire again. These stay in place SOO much better, anyway.", "summary": "Super comfortable, but not perfect.", "unixReviewTime": 1453248000}

The \"cup\" of the bra doesn't cover as much width as a standard bra cup - as you can see in the side shots of the models. The unfortunate result of this for me was a double side-boob.

The bracelet is leather and has a silver metal tab with the sign inscribed on it. I chose Leo because I am a leo, but I will actually be sending this to one of my good friends who is also a leo. There are a lot of us summer babies.  The leather has a soft interior which is a bit stiff at first but wears down quickly and looks nice, the cording is in a double hitch style knot so that you can slide the ends apart easily to loosen and tighten the bracelet down. This is what will hold it to your wrist. It adjusts well and fits nicely.

I pride myself in the ability to whip up some bad ass Victory Rolls a la Betty Grable!  Alas, being a mamma with two busy toddlers, doesnt quite go hand in hand with the time consuming preparation it takes to pull off an awesome vintage look. But,  with this hat I have found a muse to get me excited about curling and pinning once again! When I saw this fascinator it was love at first sight and I knew I could not live without it! The day it was delivered I immediately put it on and even though it was a lazy pajama day I wore it the rest of the night. It was an interesting look, sweats and a fancy gorgeous hat! Haha!\nMy girls were equally in love with this gem! I had to indulge them as well. Actually I didn't have a choice; they were begging me to try it on! They love playing dress up as much as I do!\nAs far as quality goes, I was not expecting much. A lot of the  fascinators Ive seen at the mall are just barely hot glued to a clip or headband and look like they were quickly thrown together with the cheapest materials available.\nHappily, this fascinator could not be more different than those mall monstrosity's! The mesh used is thick and sturdy, all pearl and feather embellishments are staying put. Nothing looks or feels cheaply made. It is comfortable and light to wear; I almost forget I am wearing anything on my head!\nWith the Thanks Giving and Christmas Holidays so close I am excited to have an excuse to show off this gorgeous hat! (Do I really NEED and excuse??) I already have the perfect retro inspired dress and up do planned for Thanks Giving!!!\nOh, and Santa Baby, if you are listening, Ive been a REALLY good girl this year..I could really use another one..or twoor three of these sexy hats under the tree!\nI reviewed this product at a discount in exchange for a fair and honest review.\nCheck out my You Tube review! https://youtu.be/jrnl1Y-7qpw", "summary": "Sexy Retro Hat is this Mamma's New Favorite!", "unixReviewTime": 1448409600}

Look great with sweaters and more rustic outerwear and flannel shirts of course. Don't really wear sports coats any more, but would pair these with a sports coat, checked shirt and wool knit tie, penny loafers, sand boots or big clunky brown oxfords optional of course.

The sizes available did not include a 10. I had to choose between an 8 and 12. My daughter wears a size 6 or 8 jeans, so a 10 in a dress would have been ideal. However, when the dress arrived it looked very small. We had her try it on by stepping into it. She could not get it on. So we took it off and put it on over her head. This way we were able to get it on and with a bit of moving and pulling we were able to get her zipped up and it fits great. However, I expected the size 12 to be much larger. We are going to buy Spanx top and bottom for her to wear under it to help it fit with a little bit of wiggle room. The dress quality is good. The lace on top is beautiful. My daughter is 5'9\" and the skirt does lays nicely over her rear end. It is not too short even with her long torso and long legs. She is excited to wear it to the first dance in school. You can easily add a rhinestone belt/sash to dress this dress up even more. It is really an adorable and elegant dress and I'm glad it fit, even though it was much smaller than I expected it would be.\nI received this item at a discounted cost for my honest and unbiased review.

It is the perfect amount of fancy for a little black dress. Still classic but a bit of a flair for interest. I was initially concerned that it would be a bit see through but once on this is not a problem. The lace top is elegant and not itchy at all. Is a dense enough lace that it hides bra straps well yet still allows some skin to be seen. There is a fitted waist and then a slightly flared chiffon skirt. The skirt twirls and floats beautifully and feels so nice on. There is a zipper that goes down the back and it did not have any issues catching when I wore it. For me the zipper did not go down far enough to allow the dress to be pulled bottom up (wouldn't fit over my butt) however it went on top down perfectly and despite my initial fear that it wouldn't fit, it fit perfectly. I used their size chart and its a perfect fit. Love this dress and can't wait to wear it out and about.\n\nI received this dress at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

I guess now, he can use the shirt as incentive\nand make it a goal to get in shape enough for the shirt to fit.\n\nI am not a big fan of polyester, but in this instance, I would make an exception. It is breathable and very lightweight. It absorbs moisture very well, then dries quickly; it is also odor resistant. This shirt is very well made; the stitching is solid, even and strong. There is double stitching on the collar, the edge of the sleeves and on the bottom hem. I also noticed that the seller offers a 100% guarantee for 30 days with free return.

I'm not a big jewelry person; I don't want to spend a ton of money on jewelry that I will only wear for special occasions.  The snap bracelet is perfect because you can purchase several different snaps to customize one bracelet to match a million different outfits. This is a much more affordable option than buying individual bracelets for each occassion.\n\nThe snaps I received are absolutely beautiful.  I got 6 snaps and each design is really pretty and I can see myself wearing it.  Not only that, but you can actually use these snaps for necklaces, and earrings.  I got two of the same snap and now I feel I need the earrings so I can wear this set.  The quality is great and I'm really excited to get more snaps!\n\nI received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.", "summary": "These snap buttons are beautiful!", "unixReviewTime": 1443916800}

Let's start off with the good: great color, soft pliable leather, and a nice buckle that compliments the leather. This belt is also easy to adjust, just unscrew the bolt, detach the buckle, cut off a little length, punch a new hole, and reassemble everything.\nMy complaint is that the screw and nut aren't great pieces of hardware. Both pieces of the chicago screw/sex bolt are too short. The ample thickness of the leather prevents the screw pieces from fully engaging, so only a handful of threads interlock. This caused my screw to strip, rendering the belt temporarily useless. Luckily the seller was easy to contact and they sent me six sets of chicago screws so I could find the best match. I picked a longer screw/nut combo (which allows more threads to engage), but I would still prefer them to be longer and fit together more tightly.\n\nOverall though, I'm very happy with this belt so far. The new screw is holding up perfectly fine. The belt looks great and the easy/discrete length adjustment is a huge boon for someone with a 29\" waist.", "summary": "Beautiful, adjustable belt.

I have a Pandora bracelet and, at first, I was a Pandora snob that would only put Pandora charms on my bracelet.  After a couple years I became bored with the variety of beads Pandora offered.  I wanted something different.  Enter my addiction to Soufeel.  One night I was searching Amazon for charms and found the Soufeel pink travel car charm and the travel trailer charm.  I thought they would look adorable on my Pandora bangle for the summer (since I LOVE camping so much)!  When they were delivered I was in love.  I was impressed with the quality of Soufeel.  So, I went over to the Soufeel website to check out their complete line of charms, bracelets, rings and earrings.  Wow!  Such a variety!  I fell in love with the Snail Charm as soon as I laid eyes on it.  I immediately purchased it and couldn't wait for it to be delivered.  It is now one of my absolute favorite charms.  The quality is comparable to Pandora.  The swarovski crystal elements are perfectly placed and the sparkle is gorgeous.  I love the cute little black eyes on the snail, too!  It is SO cute.  The size of the charm is every so slightly bigger than that of my Pandora beads.  The best way to describe it is to look at any of your Pandora ball or spherical clip beads.  That is the size of the shell on this snail.  Now add his little body to that.  And you've got a slightly larger charm.  My Pandora bracelet is all silver charms and Pandora rose gold charms.  This little snail charm fits in beautifully with the rose gold charms.  I would not hesitate for one minute to recommend this charm to anyone looking to add a gorgeous charm to their Pandora bracelet at a FRACTION of the cost of a comparable Pandora charm.  I now own over 10 Soufeel charms and I can honestly say I love every single one of them.  The quality is comparable- the price is INCREDIBLE!", "summary": "Love, love, love.

The top white portion is so uncomfortable because you can feel the heavy flowery designs, the underside of it is like iron on patches which dig into your skin because there's nothing in between to cushion it. The flower pattern that hangs down onto the blue skirt portion is not even attached to the dress completely. They kind of dangle oddly and are so uneven they bring down the quality look of the dress. The only thing I really liked was the color which was a beautiful vibrant blue, hence the 2 stars. The complaints I have can be adjusted to, wear a slip under, make sure the flowers are smoothed down, etc. but I like items I purchase to be perfect without having to adjust too much.
