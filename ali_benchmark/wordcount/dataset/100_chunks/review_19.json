I had this band on a LG G Watch for approx 21 days.  I will state that I am a very \"fidgety\" person with watch bands and so I was adjusting the band clasp more then the average person probably would.  That being said, in less then a month the clasp \"hook bar\" bent making the watch completely unusable.  Basically the latch has two components, a bar that it hooks over and then an actual receiving hole/plug connection.  It needs to be securely on both to give it the tension to clasp and stay in place.  On my particular band because that little bar bent slightly, the clasp can now \"flex\" which causes the hole/plug connection to no longer be secure.  You GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, I'm not mad or anything I just want to give some voice for those considering this band that yes, at this price, your going to get something of lower quality...  Moving on from the band FAILING.  It wore fine, I enjoyed it.  I have sensitive skin so any kind of rubber or leather band doesn't work.  Traditional steel bands don't work for me because of the lack of fine adjustability (again I'm fidgety) so this is a great compromise.\n\nIf your going to buy one, be very mindful when making adjustments to the clasp.  You have to use force to get the \"teeth\" to let go but if you use too much force you will ultimately bend or damage the clasp.  I've owned plenty of watch bands and never had this issue, it simply comes down to at this price point your getting something that is going to be relatively (to the price point) flimsy and you need to treat it as such.  In my case I probably made far too many adjustments in such a short time and weakened the metal to the point it bent.  Buyer beware of that is all.", "summary": "It wore fine, I enjoyed it", "unixReviewTime": 1424995200}

The Arm is made of a hard and durable plastic (with the paint it looks enough like metal), the paint job is ok (The red star isn't perfect but you wouldn't notice from a distance and could easily be fixed up, the rest is great), and the detail of the molding is Fantastic! Based on that I would give it 5 stars.\n\nHowever my 2nd concern was weather of not it would fit. I am 5'10\" with a muscular build. I believe the molding was made for some one shorter (with shorter arms). It is difficult to shove the top part all the way on, and the way its made the shoulder sticks out noticeably to fare (I think that would be an issue for almost anyone who bought this for most body types). If the materials it was made out of were more flexible I think these would be less of an issue. Also, if the plastic was less sturdy it might be easier for fix for each individual after purchase.\n\nAll in all, it is a Great looking product, and I am able to shove it on my arm (through some discomfort and lack of mobility while wearing it). If I had the right tools and butter personal crafting skills I could probably fix it to make it fit better.", "summary": "Looks Great!

I do not believe it is steel boned, because it's very bendable. But, honestly I am not sure. This is my first time. I am new to waist training. I've done a lot of research, so I know there are better corsets out there but they cost so much more. In my opinion, I felt  that this is great for someone trying out waist training for the first time because if it is something you may not like at least you didn't invest a whole lot. I don't regret this buy, in fact I recommend it. But please remember I'm new to waist training so I can be wrong. If it's not steel boned than will it work for waist training, I don't know.  With that said, it is the first day. I gotten mine within a week, weeks before expected- always a plus. Not sure if this will help also, but as for sizing I did go a size smaller than my natural waist measurement. I hope I was able to answer questions you might have had, and guided you the right way for whatever you ended up deciding.", "summary": "love it for the price!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1415404800}

I bought these to be worn with cowgirl boots for my daughter, they come just above the boots on her leg and right below her knee. I ordered the size S 3-6Y for my daughter who is 3 years old, about 37 inches tall, weighs 29lbs and her shoe size is a 9 (toddler). I imagine these would easily fit up to a few sizes larger because they are so stretchy and the heel goes slightly past my daughters.\n\nThese socks are very soft and very stretchy, my daughter has no complaints while wearing them, she actually loves to wear them around the house. The designs are cute and vary enough so that they don't all look alike. I will certainly be buying more of these \"boot socks\".\n\nPros:\nSuper soft and stretchy\nKnee-high\nGood price\nCute designs\n\nCons:\nThey do not have non-slip bottoms\nThey come held together in pairs with little metal clips at the toes that could be a choking hazard and an ouch if stepped on.

The bag came scuffed, but I was able to get the scuff marks off. a couple of the studs are scratched, so the silver is showing through the tan color. Some of the stitching is a little sloppy, tho it seems fairly sturdy. Overall I still like the bag, its very cute, but I'm very disappointed in the black trimming, it really cheapens the look of the bag, and other customer images did not have this black trimming, maybe I got a reject one after my first one went missing. :(", "summary": "OK, but not exactly as expected", "unixReviewTime": 1464912000}

The onsie was bought for my husband who is about 5'9 and around 190lbs with a 32 waist he is very muscular even though he has a pretty small waist so I got an extra large to be sure it would fit the shoulders and arms. It fit very well. A little loose in places but never too tight anywhere else. My problem is with the poor stitching and the cheapness of the material. For 40 bucks I would expect it to not be coming apart at the seams after one use. There were already a bunch of lose strings before he even put it on. So he wore it for a xmas party and it was cute and did its job. The butt flap was adorable. He couldn't wear it again though because it's literally falling apart and I doubt it would survive the washer.", "summary": "Good for One Time Use", "unixReviewTime": 1451174400}

My roommate turned me on to the C-shaped nose hoop, which is much easier to put in and take out as compared to full circle hoops that require a lot of bending and what not to get in.\nThe package arrived on time, in a nice box for safe-keeping. I appreciate the variety in colors, as it is helpful to change out depending on the day. Everyone's nose is different and mine is definitely slimmer, so I found that straight out of the box the ring was a bit too wide for my nose to look normal. Luckily the metal is strong yet malleable, and I was able to easily bend the ring to fit exactly how I liked it in my nose. This is also useful when taking the ring out as well.\nThe only down-side to this type of nose ring is that, as it doesn't have anything really to hold it in place, that the flat portion destined to rest against the inside of your nose often shifts and is visible within your nostril with high activity. This is to be expected, however, with this style of ring and not a fault of the product itself. Just be aware it is not completely secure and can slide out from your nose to some extent. As a natural fidgeter, however, it is not difficult for me to adjust it throughout the day to ensure it stays in place. Even with that small downfall, this is the only type of nose ring I'd like to wear as it is easily removable for swapping and cleaning your face as well.\nThe included photo shows me wearing the black colored ring.\nOverall, this is a quality product that has done well for me so far. I would suggest it to anyone and will purchase more in the future!", "summary": "Quality, Adjustable Product", "unixReviewTime": 1451865600}

I was so excited to get these rings that as soon as I got them, I disinfected the gold ring according to the instructions my piercer gave me (I got my nose done 5 months before I got these, so the piercing was healed, but I was still maintaining contact with my piercer since I wanted to get pierced by her again at some point) and I put it in. I had issues with getting it to stay in, but other than that, I was over the moon. I started to notice some irritation towards the end of the day, but I assumed that it was just from me having to readjust it more than my neometal stud. But when I woke up the next morning, I was in excruciating pain. My nose was swolen and I realized that it had to be from the ring since I had never had any problems before and, like I said, it was a healed piercing. So, I ran into the bathroom to change it and between the time that I took out the ring and went to re-insert the stud, my nose had already started to close up. I essentially ended up having to re-pierce my nose. Now, I'm not sure if there was something wrong with the metal used or if I might have a metal allergy (I have my ears pierced though and have never had any problem with sterling silver). My main point of this is BE CAREFUL. If you think you might have a metal allergy, don't get these. If you have a new piercing, don't get these.

Worst of all, the gold paint over the plastic frames is all scuffed up --- particularly on the arms of the glasses. It's like people have been wearing these for a year before they were mailed to us or maybe they fell off the conveyor belt in the Chinese factory they were made in (they're made in China) and kicked around on the factory floor for a while. Whatever it was, there was no quality control and they had no qualms about sending out very scuffed up frames (the lenses aren't scuffed but are entirely sticky on the side facing your eyes).\n\nI would send these back in a second, but my son wants to keep them because he hasn't seen wide \"gold\" frames anywhere else and, frankly, it's not worth my time and trouble to send back $10 glasses or I would.

I generally do not take time to return things I've ordered online which results in wasted money and a closet half full of ill-fitting clothes.  In the case of this dress, I got very lucky; there were no reviews on it previously so here is the first one.  I ordered a medium which is generally the size I wear.  My measurements are:  Bust:  35 1/2\"  Waist:  29\"  Hips:  39\"  It fits  - like a glove as they say.  I don't mean that in the sense that it looks cheap and inappropriate - just that it just fits really close to the body, much as you see in the ad for the dress.  The material is not thick, it is a thinner, stretchy material, but it does not feel cheap.  It's a nice thin material that is comfortable for hot weather.  I would really recommend this dress - I'm very happy with it.  Based on the measurements I gave, if you like clothes that fit a little more loosely, I would definitely choose one size up.  Otherwise, if you want it to fit as you see it on the model in the ad then it's fairly true to normal sizing.", "summary": "Nice, cool dress.  Fits as expected.", "unixReviewTime": 1405382400}

Makes you 100% flat. I'd suggest ordering 1 to 2 sizes up, unless you're very small. Asian sizes tend to be smaller than American ones. I'm about 5'3 and 145 pounds, so if you're any bigger than that, the binder may not fit. In that case, you should order an official Underworks product or something similar if you've got the money for it. This binder is attached to a stretchy and breathable tank top, which is pretty comfortable. It's is a little thick, so it hurts my back a little, but I think it's because I need to break it in. However, it flattens me pretty well, so I'm not complaining too much. The only real complaint I have is that the binding part doesn't stay in place very well on the shirt, so it gets twisted sometimes and can be difficult to fix. I'd recommend hand washing it, if you can. Overall, I'd recommend this, especially if you're on a budget.

Wear it driving in a convertible on a sunny day?  Major distraction!  Wear it boating or fishing on a bright, sunny day?  Painful!  But the good news is that the mesh extends all around the cap, allowing for ample air circulation, which is why I wanted the cap in the first place.

This doesn't do that at ALL! It actually elongated my neckline, and it has an adjustable clasp, so you tall-neck people can wear it, too! I know, I thought I could make you jealous by saying only short-necked people could wear it, but alas, I can't. Grrrrr! You tall, slender, elongated people look great in most anything!!

However, that is definitely NOT the case here. The shorts area are COMPLETELY see through, exactly as if you're wearing panty hose--And I don't mean see through as in only when you bend over, I am talking about 100% see through. Initially I bought these so I could wear them with a sexy top for when going to a bar or club or something bc I LOVE leggings so much, but the second I put them on, I realized I for sure could not do that with these bc of how see through they are. You can't even wear it with a shirt that has any slits at the side or high-low hems or anything bc not only is the area see through but they also have all these unflattering hemlines just like pantyhose! Therefore, unless your plan on wearing these with a dress or extremely long tunic shirt, I would definitely NOT recommend buying these tights.\nAlso the material of the tights are ok, the mesh part is very similar to panty hose material and the crisis-cross straps are made out of this shiny, silky, nylon material. Not my favorite, that's for sure. However, it did fit with a little extra room to spare, I'm 5'4\" 125 lbs and they weren't big to the point of falling off but they also were not as tight as my other comfortable leggings.

It looks like someone tried them on and returned them and ripped a whole in them or someone took a pair of scissors and just cut right through it. I'm pretty upset I received damaged goods and that the item wasn't checked before mailed out.  Other than that, the leggings look great when on and is exactly what is pictured but you can tell the fabric is dyed because I noticed some black dye on my fingernails after putting them on.  It definitely has a chemical smell to it and I've read other reviews about how the leggings dyed their legs black, so... I'm not sure how confident I feel about wearing leggings like these.\n\nThese are probably good for wear a few times then toss them.  I only give it 2 stars because they look great and I received them within 2 days as promised, but I don't think these would hold up in the wash and if I'm getting dye on my fingernails already...

You can depend upon this particular style of shirt to fit most people up to a size of 2XL.  I feel that this shirt fits pretty good because it is actually a type of caftan, which are traditionally designed to be extremely baggy.  If it were not for that, this top would probably not fit a plus size woman.  I ordered this blouse with a different print twice before, and I was thoroughly satisfied.  On an American size 14-16, the sleeves stop short, just past the elbow, but does not extend to the wrist as shown on the model.  Of course this can be attributed to the fact that the model is probably a size 0-2 in American measurements.

For the full sized portion you will definitely need to carry it in a coat pocket or a small bag. The take-out portion works pretty well as a stand-alone wallet and also looks great, although the magnetic clasps that are supposed to keep it closed are too flimsy. As another reviewer noted, the slots for the cards are initially very snug. It will take maybe a month or more of regular use to break in the leather so cards slide in and out easily. Same is true for folding the take-out portion: if you have more than 2 cards or a lot of cash, it won't fold in half easily right away.

The Bellroy Take Out appeared to be an ideal solution.  Unfortunately, it wasn't.\n\nThe wallet itself is beautiful and the design is ingenious.  However, credit cards must be slightly smaller in Australia (where the wallet is made) than in the US. Trying to insert and remove cards was a frustrating, difficult experience. It could well be that the leather would have stretched sufficiently with use to eliminate the problem but I was concerned that the stitching would give out before the leather stretched sufficiently to make the wallet usable.\n\nThe smaller \"take out\" wallet was even worse in terms of the size of the slots. The end came when I discovered I would never be able to insert a standard size business card in one of the card slots in the small inner wallet.\n\nI would have loved to keep the wallet. The workmanship and quality of the leather seemed superb.

I have had no problem with any of the others, but I had a bad skin reaction to this pair that I bought on Amazon. At least one of my other pairs of FGs have some sort of embellishment on the outside at the temple as these do. However, on these glasses differ in several ways from my other Foster Grants:\n\n1) The embellishment is larger than any of the embellishments on my other glasses.\n2) Instead of the embellishment being attached to the OUTSIDE of the stem, this heart goes THROUGH the stem. This means that the prongs holding the heart in are on the INSIDE of the glasses. This is what I thought was causing my skin irritation at first, but it was not.\n3) There is about an inch-long thin metal plate inside the right stem of these glasses that hasn't existed in any of my other FGs.\n\nI finally realized that it was the metal plate (#3) that was causing my skin irritation (a big welt on my face at the hairline, where the sunglass stem touches my face). I picked at it to see if I was able to remove it, and it came right off...apparently just glued on. I don't know the purpose of this piece of metal in the stem of the glasses, but it was a major source of irritation for me. Once removed, I could wear the glasses w/o irritation.\n\nSince these were the first pair of Foster Grants I bought online, I did not realize how huge they are. The parts of the sunglasses that shield my eyes are MUCH larger than my other FGs. Because of this, the lower rim of the plastic lenses sits on my face. This is a problem for me because I sweat a LOT from the face when it's hot. As a result, I don't wear these FG sunglasses as much as my other remaining pair.\n\nOf the four or so pair of Foster Grant sunglasses I've owned, these are probably my least favorite. Part of that is because they are so big on my face.", "summary": "If you are metal allergic/sensitive, beware.

Not only because they were under 10 bucks but because they look great. I usually hate oversized sunglasses because they seem to be associated with either little old ladies or movie stars trying to go incognito. Neither apply to me. And until now, have never had one that fit my face. I've tried about  a hundred oversized sunglasses and never could find a pair that I liked enough to buy so I had never EVER intended to ever buy one for myself (having long ago decided that the 'retired-to-Florida snowbird' look should be reserved only for actual snowbirds), but I needed a pair of sunglasses badly, and I REALLY didn't want to have to go to the mall just to get a pair. I figured, since I only need them for the 15 minutes it takes me to get to work, even if they didn't look good, for $10 and the convenience of not having to go to the mall, it would do.\n\nAnd boy am I glad I did. They look really stylish on and they're comfortable (they don't pinch like cheap glasses have a tendency to do) even while being snug. I have really long eyelashes and they don't hit the lenses (which gets irritating fast) yet they still fit really well...high up on the nose.\n\nI deducted a star because the big faux-gold hearts on the side look a tad cheap.

I received it in about ten days or so. The jewelry is awesome! There are exactly 30 barbells in the package. Some of the little balls were loose, but there were no missing pieces at all. I had two duplicates, set one of them aside to give to a friend. I set another four barbells aside to also give away, but out of personal preference. I'm not a fan of pot leaves and there were three different pot leaf designs, one duplicate pot leaf. So I was left with a total of 25 tongue rings. All the graphics are clear and not tacky or cheap-looking at all. They look like graphic barbells you'd see at a Hot Topic or Spencer's. They're all really cool and I look forward to wearing them all. The reason why I rated 4 stars and not 5 is because I got 6 barbells that were a solid color and not a graphic design. Also, I was kind of looking forward to some of the designs shown in the picture like the Ariel one, and the brass knuckles and several others that I didn't recieve. But I mean, that's to be expected when there's a large variety of designs they randomly choose 30 of them to send Most of what I received wasn't even shown in the picture, but I love them. I got a tarantula, a Nike symbol, and just a bunch of random awesome ones. They look pretty clean, but I mean if you order something online that's gonna be in your mouth obviously you have to clean it well and sterilize it as a precaution. Overall, I did love them all for the most part. I would definitely recommend and I would definitely order it again just to see what other cool designs I may get.", "summary": ":)", "unixReviewTime": 1404086400}

This dress was purchased for homecoming and is one of the best-made dresses we have ever bought.  There is a great built in bra that has an independent adjustable backstrap, which helps because my daughter wears a size c cup but has a tiny waist. She's 5'4, 120# and the skirt tulle lands in the mid to lower thigh area. The size 6 fits her wonderfully. The color is a pretty lilac as the picture shows on our computer.\n As another review mentioned, the jeweled waist has fewer in number of jewels--it's the same general pattern only the jewels are much more spread out.  This is true for the bust jewels as well, but that isn't a problem because we anticipated adding craft store jewels to the skirt anyway so we'll just buy a few additional for the waist and bustline. The skirt is slightly different in \"poof\" compared to the picture.  Instead of being tutu like, ours is a bit more flowing.  For someone with a bigger bust, small waist, and bigger hips (think hourglass figure here) it is the perfect dress.  I wouldn't hesitate in recommending it.", "summary": "Wonderfully made dress", "unixReviewTime": 1412640000}

The jewels on the waist band were also asymmetrical (spacing wise) as the original review had said, not to mention that there were about half the amount of jewels than what the dress has in the picture. The skirt was also way too poofy. I, for some strange reason, was thinking that the skirt wouldnt actually be that big, but in fact it was almost bigger.

The top creased a little bit during shipping, which I'm still trying to get it flat despite washing a few times. However, it is not too noticeable. The suit fit me perfectly. I do not have a big chest but I can see if people have a bigger chest, they might want to go with a bigger size.

That all said, I can wear the Ebuddy top with my other black bikini bottoms (since the Ebuddy's are so funky) so it's a win I suppose.

After reading mixed reviews I didn't have my hopes up too high, so when I got the package, which debt arrived very quickly, I guess that it met my expectations. I expected the product to be a little bit tight, which it was, but not overwhelmingly small so that is something to keep in mind. Typically I fit into a medium swimsuit, and I decided to just continue with that size and buy this one in a medium, despite customer reviews and disappointment from other offbrand swimsuit Look-alikes that have tended to run quite small. I was not disappointed. Like I said, the fit was slightly small, but that does not to take away from the quality of the material. The colors have not yet faded but I have not wash the swimsuit, only let it air dry after a vacation. The colors are very true to the picture and are very bright. The bottoms are what run a little bit tight, but I am a 5 foot five teen who weighs a little less than 120 pounds. My bra size is a 32C in most cases, and I was very pleased with the fit of the top. Only one adjustment setting, but over all the cups fit nice on my breasts, but the front material is a little thin. I will probably be using padding from other similar swimsuit styles just to make sure that my nipples don't pop through. Then again, TMI, but my nipples pop through a lot of things when I'm not wearing padding, so if you don't have that problem you probably will be just fine. If I adjust the top correctly, there is no peep show though, so it just depends on the person and how their body is built! Overall a very good purchase and I would recommend to people, as the quality is fairly high and extremely similar to that of the Triangl brand.", "summary": "Overall, pretty impressed!

The bottoms of the medium fit like a glove, but the band of the top was too large on my smaller frame. The top looks fine from the front due to the structure of the cups, but from the back you can see that the band curves up and onto my shoulders to compensate for the extra inches of fabric. The fastening at the back of the top piece is not the most attractive. It's made of black plastic and it clicks together like a seatbelt.

So I took it to a tailor, and they did the best they could to take it in and fix the cleavage.

The bottoms fit great, I'm small, and the small size bottoms probably wouldn't have fit me at all. I don't think a small top would have fit cup wise either, but it's too big around me\n\nThe color and quality of the suit was as expected from other reviews, very thick bottoms, kinda thin top, but not too too thin, it's livable. Would have definitely sucked if there was no underwire. I like the clasp on the back but idk if they'll even be able to keep it when I get it taken in because it is way too big in that sense.\n\nPackaging. The have it folded into a tiny little rectangle that causes creases, I don't think they'll be too noticeable. But who wants something new that's not in perfect condition. Leave it to me to put creases if I don't take care of it, not you to save money on shipping costs.\n\nCool suit. Ordered in the other style. Much more exited for that one!", "summary": "Great suit for the price, needs some work on sizing", "unixReviewTime": 1431561600}

I was going back and forth between buying this suit at a 1/4 of the price or investing in the actual Triangl suit. I thought that this would not look like the picture, that the quality would not be as high, that the fit would be off, and that it would be made of a much cheaper material than the Triangl swimsuits are. Happy to report that this is not at all the case. First, I must say that the neoprene material is thick, has a good hand, covers well, and feels expensive. The picture is exactly how the suit came-no surprises there. The only thing that I would change would be to be able to choose the size of your top and bottom instead of only choosing one size. I am about 5'6, 135 pounds and range between a 4-6, S-M. I am curvier on bottom than I am on top (usually a 34B) and ordered a size Medium. The bottoms fit perfectly which was great. A lot of times I have to size up to a Large just to get some coverage, but this was not necessary for this suit. I'm not able to fill out the top completely (also a size M), but I'll be able to make it work as it was not too noticeable or too big for my liking. Overall, I would definitely recommend this to a friend. You are saving a large amount of money and getting a suit that is almost identical to Triangl. I will invest in one of their suits one day, but was not ready to pull the trigger spending $110 with shipping.\n\nI wanted to post this review for all the others out there that are skeptical about buying this suit. I rely heavily on customer reviews before I buy anything. I hope this helps sway your decision one way or another.", "summary": "Skeptical at first, but turned out great", "unixReviewTime": 1431561600}

Oh the bad things... This style of swimsuit was never intended for girls with curves. You can force it to fit you but it is NOT flattering. The top smashes your chest in  and does not give you any cleavage. The bottoms are like DIAPERS - even in the model you can kind of see how they look like diapers (the photographers did their best to hide this). The sides of the bikinis are simply too thick and the back is too tight to accommodate and accentuate hips and butt. I am a 34 B, typically a 4 in pants, and have a 27 waist. I got a medium and the top smashed MY chest (and it's NOT even that big!) and the bottoms were a hot mess. I have a super curvy bottom and these bikinis sunk into it and so my bottom hung over the sides! Not cute. However, if you are a slim girl and don't need to worry about the booty, I bet this looks great on you! It is true neoprene, quite thick, and very vibrant.", "summary": "Pokeball...?

The cut is flattering, however, and I was happy that it fit me, since I read a bunch of other reviews and followed the sizing quide to order accordingly. That being said, the cups on the top are not quite big enough for me. I ordered the XL, as I am a U.S. Size M/6-8 usually and a 34DD on top.

Leandre", "reviewText": "Let me 1st say this, BUYER BEWARE OF WHICH SELLER THIS SUIT COMES FROM!!!! If it is not from Ebuddy, you will probably end up with a cheap looking bra and underwear polyester material bikini. I know, because this happened to me! I have even included a photo of just how big of a difference these bathing suits have from one another. The one I ordered from Ebuddy I looooove! I am 57 and 115 pounds but with a bigger chest and wider hips, and because of this I ordered a Medium. Yes, there is no padding in the Ebuddy (wetsuit version) of this bikini. However, because I have a  big chest (36C) I did not want nor did I need any padding. My tops fits great although I think it may be a little risky if one was moving around a lot. I usually wear a size 3 in pants and these bottoms fit me to perfection. Now, as for the bra and panty looking set that I received from the seller Walters Shop which AGAIN IS NOT the seller Ebuddy, this set actually has a push up cup which is exactly what you see in a push up bra. The colors do not pop and the material is totally different! It feels like regular polyester underwear with a silky finish. Certainly not made for water. The push up cup in the bra literally lifted my boobs up out of the top, total spillage! I don't understand how two sellers can claim to be selling the same item (Amazon should change this) but yet I end up with two totally different products! I knew the moment I received my Walters Shop version, that what I got was not what everyone was talking about in the other reviews. It was clear to me that this was NOT what was shown in the pictures nor what was described on the site. So I tried again and this time I made sure it was the seller matched the name of the bikini which was Ebuddy. Once this came 2days later (thanks to Amazon Prime) I knew that it was exactly what I wanted and what I was originally expecting! Check out my pics and remember to be careful when ordering! And both of these were ordered in a size Medium, but as you can see the fit is completely different!\n However, on a positive note for Walter's shop, i was refunded in full quickly!", "summary": "Buyers Beware of Seller Only Shop Ebuddy", "unixReviewTime": 1428451200}

Gonna try to make this short and sweet:\n\n*SIZING - Personally, I think it fits true to size. I am a 34C/36B (Victoria secret sizing) and usually a size 4 or small in bottoms. I ordered a M based off of other reviews about ordering a size up. BUT if you look at the FEATURES AND DETAILS section, they actually tell you what measurements add up to their sizing to order from them. Based off my body measurements, I am in fact a size M for this product, which is why I put true to size in this review. It fits snugly without making it look like a sausage casing squeezing you out everywhere. I actually like that there is no padding and that the straps are adjustable too. With that said, please bear in mind that because this comes in a set, the top may fit and the bottom may not, and vice versa. I live in Miami, and although I was not blessed with curves, I have many friends who are so definitely order a size up if you do. You may have to contact the company if one piece doesn't fit, I think it was in another review that they can work something out with you. I HAVE NOT used it in water yet, so I'll update how it fits when I do, but as a laying out at the beach bathing suit, it looks perfect.\n\n*QUALITY - for the price, you are definitely getting a steal. The colors are very vibrant and neon, which goes really well with tan skin like mine. But there a lot of color choices that are compatible with all skin tones. Because of the neoprene material, it is thick but helps make the bathing suit feel structured, especially the top piece. It stretches just enough as well as fits like a glove.\n\n*SHIPPING - I have Amazon prime and ordered it on sat, and came promptly on Monday, as expected.\n\nAll in all, I loved how this bathing suit looked and felt that I am most likely going to be buying another one. I do yoga, swim, and boot camp as my exercises, but I don't have the most in shape body; regardless, this bathing suit made me look really good lol good luck to all who end up purchasing this, I hope you are happy with your purchase as I was :)", "summary": "Definitely worth it.", "unixReviewTime": 1426464000}

Hopefully this review helps =)\nI saw the Triangl Bikini and fell in love! Wanted one so bad but am not willing to pay so much. So I checked reviews on here and customers said that it was in fact neoprene material.\n\nYes it is neoprene material and it completely covers you. It is nice and thick. The strap on the back of the top buckles but fits nice and snug. I tugged on it to see if it would easily clip open but it didnt. Im quite impressed. Shipping was very fast! Colors matched nicely from the picture to real life. I thought the color was blue but I see its purple. Either way it looks very nice. Stiching is nice and neat.\n\nMy only con is the sizing. I am a 34B size for tops and got a medium and it fits perfectly. I am a size 4 in American Eagle Jeans and got a medium bottom but they are a little too small. But itll do, maybe Im not used to so much butt hanging out? haha. I don't know. Maybe its just those chinese sizings. You know how they are smaller. (I heard girls on youtube say that their Triangl bikini shipped from Hong Kong and not Australia..hmmm).\nBut yes Ebuddy is a good place to buy your dupe for Triangl Bikini. It was $24.99.

This one has stiff wings (right a little more stiff) but it's a different feel and should work itself out fine.  This crystal is fine -- no embedded speck!  For correction of very minor issues and the watch continuing to work fine -- I have upped my \"starrage\" from 4 to 5!  Great watch -- very good company!\n\nA nice simple watch!  That's all I wanted!\n\nI cannot wear a wristwatch.  I was looking for an inexpensive pendant watch.  I found those that have the long top stems don't work so this was just what I needed - a bottom stem!\n\nIt's not perfect but the clock seems to hold time pretty well -- I've only had it a week.\n\nThe right wing does not want to extend easily.  You have to pull/push on that ear like you own it to extend out that wing.  There is a tiny white spot near the \"2\" that appears to be within the glass crystal itself rather than under or on top of it.  There are bubbles and blemishes in the finish of the metal both around the face of the watch and on the back.  All of this is minor as long as it tells time!\n\nThe box it came in was squashed in one corner and pink -- not blue like the picture shows.\n\nOn the plus side, the watch is water resistant and that was unexpected.  Since I don't always remember to take it off when I wash dishes, I appreciate that extra step.  I'm not worried if it gets splashed.  I don't have the sink that full to dunk it!\n\nAll in all -- it does what I want and is cute.  It's not perfect but for this price, that is not a reasonable expectation in the first place!

It came super fast, and I like that there are a bunch of them just in case, but wasn't a big fan of the studs as they didn't seem as firm as my bioplast studs. Someone on one of the reviews had mentioned this wouldn't work in a bioplast labret stud if you were to just put the top of the retainer into it as normally you'd screw the top piece of the bioplast into it. However, with mine I have always had to push them in as screwing them never worked, but the top piece of the retainer seemed a bit thicker than the tops of my bioplast pieces, but decided to try it on one of my bioplast studs. I was relieved when not only did it fit perfectly, but it was sturdy and took some effort to remove, which is what I wanted, and my original top piece of my bioplast still fit perfectly in the stud afterwards. I've been wearing it ever since, and am extremely happy with the results! I feel most comfortable using my own bioplast stud, but the retainer stud would probably be just fine for a short amount of time. I wanted to keep mine in for a while though so I didn't have to worry about it just before the c-section, and could focus on the baby and not having to remove and replace my lip ring right away. It isn't very invisible however, so if you need to hide it I'd suggest using make up, and then cleaning that area really good afterwards. Mine seems a little on the shinny side, almost as if I had the diamond still in, but flat. The reason why I gave a 4 star instead of the 5 was because of the stud, however this product is absolutely wonderful and I'm very happy with it!

It's true they are still fairly visible in your ears, but compared to an actual piece of jewelry, they are very subtle.  I bought these for a business trip and they worked fine with the combination of me keeping my hair down to still hide the retainers.  I also have kept them in for about a week by now, including 3 high-intensity workouts, showering, and sleeping, and they've been very secure in my ears.  I was happy to receive 7 pcs (not sure if that was intentional) because I have exactly 6 piercings, so I was glad to have a spare in case I lost parts, so overall I am happy with this purchase.\n\nThe only real downside is that they are fairly long, which makes them still noticeable in your ears (especially for me, they were more noticeable in my industrial holes than in my conch holes due to the angling).  As another reviewer wrote, they are noticeable because they're a more white-clear than a perfect clear.

SO, those went back too and I went with what I think should be two sizes bigger than what he is wearing now.  They are just a little big for him but that's what I was going for.

That worked out fine for me because I was actually a little worried that it'd be too overwhelming for my small fingers. The difference is barely noticeable though and could probably just be chalked up to the slight difference between real life and on screen images.\n- The band is very thin. I don't know if it's particularly weak because it didn't get banged around during delivery and I haven't tried to dent it, but I know some people hate the way thin bands look. For reference, I looked around for things about the same thickness to give a good idea and I'd say it's a little wider/thicker than a bobby pin. Not the thickness of the whole thing, but like if you straightened it at its bend and tried to wrap it around your finger.\n- It runs a little small but that might also be because of how thin the band is. I wear an 8 and it goes on smoothly enough, but not as smooth as my other rings with a wider band. I'm not sure it's tight enough to warrant going up a size if your fingers fit in your size pretty comfortably, but if you're prone to swelling, water retention or are at the larger end of your ring size, I'd go up.", "summary": "I'm pretty happy with the ring with just a few notes", "unixReviewTime": 1442966400}

It took about 15 business days to arrive. Once I finally opened the little box it came in, I was immediately impressed, the stones are very clear with a lot of sparkle, the main stone is not so large that it looks fake, and the rose gold is just gorgeous. The band is thin, which I love! I ordered a 7, and I usually am about a 7.5, and it fits perfectly; finally a ring that I can wear without having to buy an additional piece to be able to wear it tightly on my finger. The ring feels so light when I wear it, I almost forget I am wearing it! It is truly a stunning piece of jewelry, and I am looking forward to having it for a very long time. It almost feels like such a steal for the high quality this ring presents. If I have any changes happen with the ring, for example, if the rose gold plating chips, or if one of the stones fall out; I will be sure to update my review. When I wear the ring, it looks just perfect; not fake, and gaudy like a lot of CZ rings tend to be. My husband loves this ring too, he wanted me to find something I really wanted, since I refuse to drop thousands of dollars on a ring, and I am so glad I came across this ring, it is the perfect fit, and the exact style I have always wanted....without the thousands of dollars needing to be spent to acquire it.  I hope my review helps in the decision making, because at first when I began my searching, I kept seeing this ring pop up in the suggestions pages on here, and I am glad I ended up going with my gut on this one. These photos do not do this ring justice, it is just so gorgeous in person. I just wish the shipping didn't take so long, that's really the only downside. To be safe, I do take my ring off when I wash my hands, or do any kind of house work, and I will also remove it when I bathe....I just am too paranoid to damage this beautiful ring in any way! I highly recommend this ring for anyone that is tired of the boring wedding rings out there, and those that are like me that refuse to drop thousands of dollars on a diamond, when in actuality, CZ, in my opinion, is way more gorgeous and affordable than a diamond will ever be! <3 :-)", "summary": "The most beautiful ring I've ever purchased!", "unixReviewTime": 1413936000}
