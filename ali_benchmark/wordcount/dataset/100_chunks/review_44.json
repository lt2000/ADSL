Love it! It fits like it was made for me, I wish all colors were available I'd order right now! It is extremely flattering to my mid section and all around petite but athletic frame. It is lower cut in the bust but in a flattering way. If the V-Neck cut is a concern when considering this dress I would say don't worry, it isn't inappropriate or distasteful but yes it is a V-neck and some women worry about that because some stores make the V's way too deep.  Even if you order this and think it is an issue they sell lace bandeaus to wear under or add a stitch or pin and that will solve it. I don't feel it is low at all and I wear a 36C.  They also have the wraps/shawls which I will be wearing to add a pop of color.  What I like most about this dress is the flattering nature of course but the rhinestone broach in the middle really makes it look much more expensive than it is. It dresses it up a lot! The bling detail is really pretty and dresses up an otherwise plain black dress. There is an extra piece of chiffon/polyester fabric overlay hanging from the broach on the waist too that is so elegant and flowy. The material is fine in my book plus it is nice and lightweight and keeps the cost down. I am 5'2\"-5'3\" and the length is NOT short it is perfect falling ever so slightly above my knees. I plan to wear 5\" heels and it still looked appropriate. Maybe the reviewers that called it a mini were taller than me....(which is highly possible considering I am vertically challenged lol)....but even at that it isn't a mini by definition by any means. I couldn't be happier with a dress and this is my 4th dress by Ever Pretty and definitely the best. I also absolutely adore their customer service, this is a win-win in my books. Great products and great service! Only thing is I wish THIS dress came in more colors and I could get the blue one in my size! This dress fits like a glove ladies and I cant see it looking bad on ANY figure. Its disguising my weight gain from a medical issue and having little ones big time and makes me feel put together in a nice dress for a family wedding....cant beat that!", "summary": "MAGICAL DRESS!

I will admit that I ordered this as a temporary \"substitute\" for my Michael Kors watch that I am sending in for repair/cleaning. With that being said I definitely did not have high expectations for a $20.00 watch. I did however, expect to get the watch I saw in the picture (review to my uploaded pictures for the review). I own two other Geneva watches that are solid decent little watches and I own about four XOXO watches that are also perfectly capable of being daily watches. So when I received this I was literally blown away. First of all its so giant I can legitimately wear it on my ANKLE! I wear my watches EXTREMELY loose.. If you look at the sales image you will notice the arrows inside the band pointing to the links which you can remove and you will also note the Geneva name. Well not the case with this watch! To top all of those issues its loud, like it sounds like coins inside a tin can. I am so unsatisfied.\n\n**** I need to add this UPDATED REVIEW **** I emailed the seller (Jill) and expressed my unhappiness. She IMMEDIATELY responded, apologized, and offered me a few options for solutions. I was so impressed that I actually felt guilty for being rude. I told her I would send her the watch back if she had anything similar in inventory that was of better quality and I would pay for it. She said no and told me she had already sent a rose gold watch that retailed for like 30.00 and to keep the other watch. Super impressed with Jill and Safari Watch Company which is why I upgrade this review by one star.

I wore a camisole under mine.\n\nThe dress was very comfortable, flowing and slightly too long for me. It grazes the ground when I am barefoot or in flats. If I wore heels - even short heels - it would not touch the ground. If I wanted it to sit higher, I could easily hem it. I am 5'2\" tall.  The colour is actually quite nice and the fit is flattering for my curvy figure.

Foam strips were included that can be placed inside the inner band if the hat is very much too large. It was a close enough fit for me that I did not need to use the included foam strips. If the included foam sizing strips make the hat too tight, there are many different thinner materials that one can use to place inside the inner band to easily get this hat to fit well if it's too large.

Dealing with Luxottica Consumer Warranty and Repairs that handles Ray Ban's customer service is very difficult and extremely frustrating. I initially contacted them via email so I can include pictures(attached to this review) of the defective part along with my request for a replacement. It took a few back and forth emails before I realized it was pointless because I was only getting a computer generated generic response so I decided to call their toll free number. I provided the rep with the case / incident number as stated on the emails so she can understand what my concerns were and see the pictures for herself. I explained to her that I understood their policy for claiming warranty. However, given the fact that these were my son's prescription glasses and he had no spare to use while they conduct their warranty claim investigation that could take up to 6 weeks, I was hoping they will recognize the obvious defect of the part, simply send me the replacement and spare me the cost of sending them the glasses, take the risk of losing them in the mail or the lens sustaining damages that they stated they will not be responsible for and more importantly, my son not having the glasses he needs in order to see well! Instead, the rep reiterated the same generic response I got from the email giving me the option to either go through the entire warranty claim process or purchase the part to replace the factory defective one at a ridiculous price. I thanked the rep for her time and expressed my sentiments towards this particular Ray Ban product and their policy for warranty claims. My family and I all wear Ray Ban both as prescription glasses and sunglasses and have always been pleased with its quality with the exemption of this model.

The texture is very soft and pleasant and the colors are attractive. The blue is a bit darker and more vibrant than in the provided photos, but I do not mind the minor difference. The individual fibers are thin, so keep a wide-toothed comb with you to avoid tangling. The bangs are long so you will need to cut them to fit your face or style them swept to the side.\n\nIt's obvious that you're wearing a wig to anyone who gets close; this is not like other cheap-but-nice wigs I have purchased, which are often mistaken for my real hair. I doubt this was intended as a hair replacement anyway, given the price, but you could use it for that if you don't mind strangers knowing it's fake.\n\nUnfortunately, the cap on the inside of the wig is VERY large, much bigger than on any other wig I have seen. If you use the adjuster straps to compensate, the cap's extra surface area bunches up into a bulge that sticks out far enough to be noticed by an onlooker. This is going to take some serious adjustment. I may even need to remove some of the hair and re-sew the cap entirely.\n\n----  ----  ----\n\nPros: Soft, attractive colors, my boss likes it\n\nCons: Poorly sized, will not pass as real hair\n\n----  ----  ----\n\nNow I will sum up. *ahem* If you have a larger-than-average head, this wig is perfect for you.

I was skeptical but I trusted in the website...  So, I did; I ordered that size.  Unfortunately, it was MUCH too small.  After a little unorthodox yoga I did manage to get it on and fastened in the back.  It was too tight around and the cups barely covered the gals (I realize I'm busty for my size but a C/D should mean a C/D!).  So, when ordering this model ladies, size up!\n\nThe good stuff:  This is a well made over-the-shoulder-bolder-holder.  No loose stitching, the elastic seems to be high quality.

I was expecting a delicate, silken, twisted, silver cord with a nice silver pendant. What I got was thick, beefy drapery cord-like rope with two large silver balls on the end with some chunky chain hooking it to a large locket. The cording is multi-strand twist of black cords with silver colored cotton thread wound tightly around the cores. Which is fine, but it produces a dull finish rather than the silken look in the photo; and if the threads are snagged or out of place there is a black 'mark' in the design. It is more tacky than elegant.\n\nI am assuming the market for this type of necklace is for it to be locked on and not come off, i.e. BDSM Collars, loving locket to a wife, etc. But I was concerned that the cording would not dry out completely from showering, etc and perhaps mildew or rot.\n\nThe locket is however stunning! It is worth the price of the whole necklace. It is shiny, about the size of a half dollar, and really works! I slipped the lock onto a sterling silver \"Omega\" choker necklace. I took the regular clasp off that necklace and replaced with a few jump rings I soldier closed and my Sir locked it around my neck. It now looks like something I can wear anywhere and only those 'in the know' would know what it really stands for, all others think it is a beautiful piece of jewlery.", "summary": "This has potential with some buyer modifications", "unixReviewTime": 1323561600}

This shoe in a size 11 medium, which I just purchased, fits like a glove.  The quality for me is as good as ever.  My foot is a little on the narrow side of medium so if your foot is on the wide side, I think it would be snug.  My old shoes were always black with a black sole.  I do not object to the natural latex color of the soles, in fact I like it but it would be a good idea to offer both colors, but don't drop black leather uppers. BUT, The leather in the old shoe was softer and there was more room in the toe box.  I think I would still prefer the black sole over the natural latex color.  As Ive found out, good old friends from the past change as well as good old shoes from the past!  Why can't the shoe companys leave a good popular, useful, well fitting, comfortable, long lasting shoe alone?  They all do this.  This is my updated take after several weeks.  Upon closer examination the width on both pairs of these shoes I purchased are unmarked and also the box is unmarked, but I ordered 11D in both pairs. So the problems with this shoe are; too narrow, narrow toe box,no arch support,stiff leather,black shoe should have black sole.  If these dislikes were corrected this shoe would sell like gangbusters. The soles on these shoes are very slippery on wet surfaces.  The old shoes were not like that!", "summary": "We all wish for the old shoe.", "unixReviewTime": 1361404800}

The digital functions are only visible for a few seconds when activated; otherwise only the analog function is visible. The digital display is easily visible in both dark & brightly lit conditions. There is no lap, countdown, or other timing functions, so if that is of concern, then this timepiece is not for you. But, if you want simple time, date, day, and alarm functionality, this watch delivers them supremely.\n\nNote: Do not be confused by the individuals who complained about the band being too long. They obviously have no background in engineering. Simply locate the round pin that joins each link and using a small punch, drive it out. Two pins must be removed to in order to take out one link; save one of the two pins to rejoin the band where the one (or more) links were removed. I took one link out on either side of the clasp (a total of two links) to keep the clasp centered. There is additional adjustment with spring loaded pins in the clasp for a PERFECT fit!!!\n\nI am extremely pleased with my purchase and recommend it highly to anyone interested in a substantial, fashionable, and solid timepiece.", "summary": "Extremely pleased.

The digital time is not permanently on the watch it is something you can press a button to check.

I bought my first pair in San Antonio after bringing foolishly uncomfortable shoes to a conference. I bought my second pair 3 years later after the first pair wore out.  I was hesitant to purchase these because of the pattern and worried about what I would wear them with, but I am so happy I did.  These shoes go with almost everything and I get compliments every time I wear them.  They are stylish, comfy, and classy which I love!  And I will confess....I stalked them on Amazon until my size was in stock and then purchased them ASAP.  Would have bought 2 pairs if they were available.  I did buy a pair in plain black too.\n\nThe fabric is extremely durable and when I disposed of the first pair it was only because of the soles.  I walk heavy on my heels and I was surprised that the shoes lasted 3 years (worn in spring, summer, and fall) with the amount of walking I do at work (roughly 3 miles a day - outside and inside).  The front of the soles were fine.  The fabric looks almost brand new, no holes or tears, the patent leather fronts looked good.  One of my favorite things is that the shoe didn't get wider with wear.  I have narrow to normal feet in terms of width, but I have noticed that a lot of flats will get wide in the center after several months of wear.  These don't. YAY!\n\nComfort - these shoes are comfy for wearing all day.  I hate flats that dig into my heels and these don't, which was a welcome surprise.  I also enjoy that they have a sole and heel, so it doesn't feel like I am walking on the ground.  I hate that about the ever so popular ballerina flats.  I have very high arches and these don't have support.  I haven't add anything to them to create support, but I am not at a place where I worry about that too much.\n\nTIP: Pick up your feet - I tend to drag the front of my foot when I walk and I caught the curb once with the toe.

This is an EL panel. It is a visibly obvious panel in well lighting. The image makes it looks like the edges can't be seen. but you'll be able to tell its something attached to a shirt in decent lighting. However I knew it would be like that.\n\nI didn't actually use the shirt, I just took the panel off and attached it to the back of another shirt. The shirt itself has an inner sleeve for the wiring to run through as well as a pocket to hold the inverter. The inverter makes an audible tone when its activated, but considering that its sound activated, its nigh impossible to notice it over the sound that activated it, save for tapping on it. This tone is necessary for the EL panels to glow at their brightest, so don't bother trying to find one without it. It'll be disappointingly dim.\n\nthe light is visible in moderate indoor lighting. But not strong. in sunlight its unnoticed. In poor lighting ( like a club) its as bright as the sun. There is no variation in the levels of the equalizers. the bars raise the same way every time, but they do it a natural way. You would only notice its not right if you're a serious sound junkie, or if you just stared at it for 30 seconds.\n\nThe panel is held on with velco(hooks and loops) and can be removed for cleaning.\n\nIt has a sound sensitivity slider, which is pretty good. But if you're in an environment with overwhelming noise. like a concert, it'll pretty much be always on with the lowest setting. But in moderate sound like a bar, or party you'll have no trouble adjusting it to respond to desire.", "summary": "Solid panel", "unixReviewTime": 1384128000}

The boots are too bulky. My boy is 5, almost 6yrs old. The 1000gr boots are too heavy for him to lug around. Not sure why they don't offer a 400 or 600 gram boot. Also, he wore them yesterday first time for duck hunt. He complained a lot they were hurting him. I couldn't tell where. At lunch we too them off and the sides of both legs were rubbed raw, I felt bad for not taking him serious earlier that morning. The area rubbed was directly below the knes on inside and outside both calves/shin. The problem is the top of the boot is so narrow shaped it digs into the skin when walking.\n Not sure if they can be \"trained\" with a clamp and heat, then cool again. But for $159 at Mack's, I should have to reshape the boot so that it doesn't dig into the side of leg. I've had the same problem with Gamewinner waders and Duck Commander waders.\n\nWe're now looking into the \"Oakiwear\" waders, but they are out of his size, I'd settle for size 13 or 1 so he could grow into them next year. Finding good youth waders is not an easy task. And since we live in Louisiana, 1000gram is just way too bulky and not necessary. 3 star because it really is good quality, other than the top of boot is shaped narrow. It looses 2 stars because they don't offer a lighter boot and rubbed my boys legs raw.\n\nMaybe the boot cuffs are narrow from being laid flat in the box for so long.", "summary": "The wader quality is good.

I have not put the mic through its paces as I have no use for it, so I cannot comment on its quality, etc.\n\nThe earmuffs fit as expected, and they are warm. They do exert a bit more pressure than others of their kind(due to the headphones, I'd guess), so they are a bit more uncomfortable to wear with glasses than others. If you're particularly sensitive or will be wearing these for extended periods of time with glasses, you might want to reconsider.\n\nThe cord is very long, and is more than adequate for connecting my phone to the earmuffs. I haven't measured it, but I'm 5'11\", and with my phone in my pocket there's still a good 6-7\" of cord left just dangling.\n\nAt first, I thought I may have been given the wrong headphones, as the instructions that came with them said the connection to the headphones was removable and was located on the left side. The pair I received had the connection on the right side(and amazon's picture indicates this is correct). The cord is removable, but it took me a bit to figure out how. The connection is covered by a small swath of earmuff cloth, so you can't just tug on the cord and pop it loose. It is reasonably difficult to re-connect and disconnect the headphones, but I prefer it this way as it means they won't come loose while wearing.", "summary": "Great set of earmuffs!", "unixReviewTime": 1389139200}

You will be hemming if you are short.  I expected that from the reviews, so ok.\nAlso, juniors means that the cut should be for girls who are not children but also not fully womanly through the hips and thighs.  So the slim fit description is somewhat accurate.\nThese days I have been wearing jeans with 28 waist.  This is sort of between a 4 and a 6 so choosing the right size for these and going up 1 size was sketchy.  I wanted to buy 1 size up but I am between sizes so I couldn't.  So these are not really a full size larger but also not humongous if I bought xxl.  The waist is good but the butt and upper thigh is snug.  Hopefully they will loosen up and I could stand to drop a pound or two.  They still look just fine thanks to the pockets in the rear.  I wanted baggy but not swimming in them. Perhaps they would be if I got XXL but then the waist would be really big so I chanced the Large.\nHope that helps anyone trying to figure out if they should get these.", "summary": "I like them but...", "unixReviewTime": 1379635200}

The tee shirt is made out of 100 % cotton, so it is soft and durable but still very comfortable. The size of the shirt is what I expected as well. I ordered it larger than my usual size because I plan on wearing it as a pajama top or to lounge around in, but I was not disappointed by the size whatsoever. The shipping on the package was exceptional as well. The shirt arrived two days after I placed the order. I love the shirt and believe it is better than compared items that are similar.

I won't go into how this is barely qualifying as a fox costume, because you can see that for yourself, but I'll let you know about fit and quality.\n\nFirst of all, it's short. If I use the clear straps, it's TOO short. But if I pin it to my corset bra (Which won't slip under a little weight,) it's just fine length-wise. (Assuming you don't mind a little cleavage.)\n\nI'm a US size 4/5 in pants and dresses with a C cup bust, and the width on the s/m size was fine with a little room to spare, but not TONS of room.  The length, again, was fine if I wasn't using the clear straps.\n\nThe quality was what you'd expect from a Halloween costume. Decent, but not amazing.

I ordered two XL dresses. I am a 10/12 with long arms and broad shoulders more of straight athletic build I guesse. The first costume arrived with a large jacket and an XL dress with a broken zipper and missing neck tie. The jacket is beautiful, truly. Vivid red strech velvel and nice gold embroidery and piping with lots of nice detail. I wish I could have made the large jacket work as it was constructed better than the second one.  I will mention that the XL dress is more like a size 14/16 and short! Thankfully the tails of the coat are long enough to cover the back or it might result in a wardrobe malfuntion possibly.\n\nThe second costume arrived, the jacket would have fit me but it fell apart as soon as I tried it on. I was careful but still multiple buttons fell off, the chains on the front of the coat were barly sewn on and came apart immediatly, and the back applette came off as well. The dress was intact and I could have pinned it to work if I had the inclination.\n\n A few other notes, the hat is comically flat and floppy on arrival, however you could make it work by spritzing it with a little water and stuffing it full of paper to pull out the creases and hold its shape while wearing it, a trick I learned from another costume. Jacket could have been repaired to work with safty pins in a hurry, or an hour or restiching if your are determined.

However, the molding process for the plastic must not be consistent, because about half the pairs come with the ear pieces bent in wonky directions.\n\nUltimately they're a weird mix of great value and \"you get what you pay for\". At least they're cheap, but I do wish they'd improve both issues of the molding consistency and the screws staying in place.", "summary": "Love and Annoyance", "unixReviewTime": 1525478400}

If you bump it into someone or something, Id say it will turn on about 79% of the time.  However, though it is sensitive, it can still be worn while sleeping without worry youll tap it and wake yourself up.  Also, when it comes to setting the interface, you really need to time it correctly, cause since there aren't any buttons, it relies on a time delay, so if you time it wrong, the interface will finish reprogramming with you being seconds off.

I like well-made, stylish, EXPENSIVE clothing.  But I'm not rich, so...  I read every review of this dress before I ordered it.  Why?  For forty bucks I really was not too worried about what I would do if I didn't like it, but I wanted to be sure it fit in case I DID like it.  And fit seemed to be the biggest topic of the reviews.  After reading, measuring and waffling (more than once), I ordered my regular size (US12).  My measurements were just a little over what the chart listed, but some of the reviews said it was running big, so I took the chance.  It fits perfectly.  It is VERY short-waisted, just 12 inches from the top of the shoulder to where the bodice meets the empire waist.  I'm 5'4, pretty short-waisted myself, and it's ALMOST too short.  This fact is made even more important when you consider that the bodice is VERY skimpy, size-wise.  I am barely a B-cup, and have had a lift, so the girls sit pretty high and tight.  Darned good thing.  Any bigger or lower and they would not have made it into the dress.  That being said, the dress is very nice for the price.  The color (vermillion) is exactly what showed on my monitor.  The fabric is okay quality-wise, nothing to write home about, but the color is gorgeous so I'm betting nobody will notice.  I ordered the matching wrap (really just a scarf) so I would have extra fabric for alterations in case the low cut under the arms bothered me, but it doesn't. so I am going to use the scarf as a sash; it's plenty long enough.  I think I will add some gold trim to the ends of the \"sash\" just to give the dress some wow factor because it really is very plain.  Classic, but plain.  All-in-all a nice dress, a good value.", "summary": "Pretty Nice!", "unixReviewTime": 1388361600}

The sizes are exact, don't order too small, they will be uncomfortable. It seems though they have changed. For the early orders I made a couple years ago the quality was amazing, the comfort was awesome. Everything fit perfect. The silver line was amazing. I bought their loungewear, long underwear, just about every piece of clothing they make. But I have noticed over the past year that the quality seems to be going down. The last pair of long underwear a purchased had the fly stitched very unusually, you could not even make use of it. That was very disappointing because that is one thing I had loved about their underwear was how usable the fly was compared to other brands. I bought a second pair of long underwear thinking I got a bad pair, but it was the same. Then last time I ordered silver, it seemed like material had changed, it was not as soft and maybe it is my imagination, but it does not seem to have the same cooling effect I got from my earlier silver purchases. My one greatest long term disappointment is I thought with the price point their products might hold up longer than their cheaper (Hanes, etc) competitors, but in the end they wear out about the same right. After about a year, they stop feeling so soft, by two years its about time to replace them. (I have wore almost nothing but Mack Weldon for three years now)\n\nSo I have downgraded from five star to four because of what seems to be their lowering quality. If they were so expensive I would go easier on them. But with what these things cost, they should be perfect. For what you pay for one pair from them, you could get ten pairs from Hanes.

I got the silver one, that they refer to as hematite. Its an entirely smooth leather feel material. I specify entirely bc it can appear the bottom is a different texture, its not, just different color. It does NOT smell like some of lesser quality bags can, when made of man made material.(tag doesn't specify the actual material, just says man made). Its a dark silver, not too shiny, which makes it a great match for wearing it with LOTS of colors. The metal attachments are all silver as well. I wear a lot of silver jewelry, so it matches my metal too :)  Zipper works good. Bag strap is a tad long for me, however it offers a few notches to move up some, but being 5.2 and wanting it even shorter, I ended up stopping by the boot shop and tipped the guy $5 to punch a few more holes in the strap for me. Inside is a tan lining and a generous zipper compartment, where I put my small wallet. It's a great bag to go between work and play, also to travel with as the size fits perfect in my backpack, while going through the airport hoopla. When I get to my destination, I can just pull the purse out and go, leaving the backpack behind with the things I don't need.", "summary": "Perfect Size", "unixReviewTime": 1502496000}

Now that may not sound like a lot, but back when I only used a pair for Tai Chi (a long time ago!), they lasted more than a year.

There are no holes to buckle into like there are on a conventional belt. Instead you stick the prong in between any two pieces of rope wherever you need it and then buckle it like a normal belt. Unstretched the 2xl belt is about 53in from buckle to tip. Maximum stretching brings the length to 93in give or take. However, I wouldn't recommend wearing it at this length, as the risk of breaking a belt loop or the belt itself is high. The tip and buckle are made from cheap leather and the prong is cheap metal.

I filled the first mug with water to rinse it out and immediately noticed that it didn't hold water. It began to leak in several places namely where the bottom piece is attached to the horn. It also leaked through several small areas on the horn. To my disappointment I found that all four mugs leaked. So they are NOT usable.

I was looking for a bottom that wouldn't expose my entire stomach when that happens, so bought these. I have mixed feelings, but the product itself is good, so that's why I rated mostly positively.\n\nPros: They are slimming bottoms, so they really keep everything sucked and tucked and give smooth lines. Obviously because they're longer, they keep your tummy covered as promised, so this is good too. When I wear my tankini, it is flattering in terms of how everything looks together without any lumps and bumps.\n\nCons: I understand why it has to be this way, but the bottoms are SO long, they literally ride up like almost to right underneath my breasts. It fits in the bottom area fine, but I have to pull it up SO far underneath in order to have pulled up all the fabric. I think I must have a short torso, and this may not be as big of an issue for someone with a longer mid-section. In the picture here, the bottom doesn't ride up THAT much. But on me, it goes up way higher than that. This is a bit uncomfortable.\n\n It can start to try to roll down a bit and then you have to pull it back up every now and again. But you have to grab it from an awkward spot because of how high up I have to pull it. It's hard to do while you have the top on. At same time, because I have a short torso, if it was much shorter, it would squeeze me right at my waist and would eliminate the smooth lines I have when wearing this suit, rendering it useless. So I deal with these issues and maybe I can see if I can have a seamstress remove a bit of the fabric on the top and sew the waist band back on (don't know if that's possible with bathing suit material).", "summary": "Smoothing, Covers Tummy.

You can't see it in the picture, because the model is either wearing a shirt over it, or it's cropped out. However, it doesn't get in the way at all. My shirt completely covered it up. I just put it as a con, just in case someone isn't expecting it.\n\n2)The tiger print is more like an applique. Like something you would iron onto it. It's not the same material as the pants. I haven't tried putting them in a dryer yet, but if I did, i'm absolutely positive the tiger pattern would completely crumble apart. So, be sure to air dry them!

They are just as comfy as they look, and so stylish! I love my clothing to be flowy and non-constricting (no tight jeans for this girl) and these are just PERFECT! The fabric is so soft and airy, but not see-through. I'm a little worried about the tiger print and shrinking, so will wash these inside out in cold water, and hang to dry. I'm 5'3, and thought myself to be a little shorter than the models and so thought the pants would reach down to my ankles; however, they reach down a couple/few inches from my ankles, but are not capri length. I wish they did reach all the way down, but just as in the photo, they do not. It's alright, though, I still love them! Anyone taller than that, be aware of that fact. These have a very stretchy waistband, so no worries for fit. The waist band is about 7 inches high, so I can wear them a little low to cover more leg.\nI am very pleased with these pants, they seem to be very well made, and the tiger print is just lovely.

When I first saw these clothes from Allegra K, I was so excited. I felt that they perfectly fit my style, and I seriously couldn't believe how cheap they were (Of course, that should have been a tip-off, but I have gotten so many things for cheap on Amazon, I was just wishing this lucky streak would continue). I searched for reviews on this line, or even this seller (regarding the clothes), but found nothing. At the last minute, I splurged and placed my order. I got the package super quickly, but none of the ten things I bought were wearable. Even though the material looks like classy chiffon/silk in the pictures, it is basically fabric that costumes are made out of. On top of the cheap fabric, the construction was terrible: seams were coming undone and stitching was crooked. Many of the tops had collars that were off-center and/or way too large (like a pilgrim costume). Two of the items had stains (one looked like spilled black ink, while the other looked like yellow-white paste). I was so sad after trying on all the items, thinking at least one would work out. I'm leaving this review on the all the pieces I bought so others thinking of purchasing these seemingly cute garments are sparred the disappointment. I emailed back and forth with the seller and they granted me a full refund. The sellers seem understanding, but the pictures are deceiving and the clothes are unwearable.", "summary": "Pictures Deceiving, Do Not Buy", "unixReviewTime": 1339545600}

This t-shirt is 100% cotton as indicated in the description, but there is no give to it (absolutely no lycra or material that has stretch to it). It's a mid-weight cotton feel (not too thin, not too thick). Since there isn't a garment-specific size chart, I can say that this runs on the small side, so I'd say size up from your usual size. It runs tight in the arms on me (but I am a kickboxer as well and have a lot of muscle, so that may be the issue for me specifically), and the neck is much more of a scoop than a crew neck than the picture would indicate. I would return this, but it comes from Germany and would cost more to return than the t-shirt costs originally, so I'll just keep it. Shipping was really quite fast considering it came from out of the U.S. (I ordered on the 13th of the month and it arrived on the 22nd, which was about 2 weeks sooner than Amazon's tracking indicated).", "summary": "Love the design, fit is small", "unixReviewTime": 1408665600}

You pretty much get everything but its not in the way the picture shows.\n\nWhite Shirt - Normal Dress Shirt\nVest - Material Made; Embroidered. Very Well Done. (comes in white or light gray - seller does not specify which you get)\nCoat with Hood - Material Made; Embroidered. Very Well Done. (comes in white or light gray - seller does not specify which you get)\nBlack Pants - Capri Pants with Stretchy Waist. Button Up.\nCloak - Material Made with Embroidery. Connects with Belt.\nGauntlet - Soft Plastic with Buckles for Adjusting\nGauntlet - Plain Soft Plastic with Velcro for Adjusting\nBelt - Costume Black Belt\nWhite Glove - Material Costume Glove\nBlack Glove - Material Costume Glove\nBoot Covers - Soft Plastic with Buckles for Adjusting\nRed Sash w/Belt - Material Made Sash with Sewn in Plastic Assassin's Logo for a Buckle; Fake Belt and two pouches. Velcro Adjusting (different versions of this exist - seller does not specify which you get)\nRed Ribbon - Just a plain Red Ribbon\n\nI ordered two of these. The first time I ordered a Medium and got the Vest and Hooded coat in white. When I ordered the same thing in large, the vest and hooded coat are a light gray. Its not a big deal to me but buyer beware. Also, the sash appears to have different styles. One version I received did not have the brown belt while one did. There is no metal buckle as the picture suggests; most of the metal you see in the picture is plastic or sewn in. For those that are wondering, I ordered them because I did like the material hood, vest, and cloak (and this was the cheapest I could find at the time to get all three). I made my own modifications after I received the items to better suit my cosplay. The pictures I'm providing is exactly what came with what I ordered. I hope this and the picture helps you guys out.\n\nIn case the pictures don't show, you can find them here (the only post on the site is the pictures so you don't have to search for them): [...]", "summary": "Not Exactly As The Picture Suggests", "unixReviewTime": 1375228800}

It has pockets but I find it much easier to find things by using small pouch bags inside the purse.  I have one bag for things like pills, another for pens, work badges, and other small items, doing this keeps me from searching through the bag for small things.

I also sent e-mails to the seller quite often to figure out the size I should be getting. I did as much research as I possibly could.\n\nFirst, I'd like to mention the pockets. The two lower outside pockets are fully functional. They were not sewn shut for me. There is also an inside pocket that is fully functional as well. The upper outer pocket is sewn shut for me. I don't know if it means it's just for aesthetics or not. It doesn't seem to be lightly sewn shut, so I don't know if it's like what the other reviewers mentioned about it being common practice or not, but you do have the two pockets at least.\n\nWhen I tried it on, it felt quite comfortable. The warmth felt like a jacket I would wear in NYC weather. But then again, I've been living in NYC for my whole life, so maybe I'm use to it. Plus I wear layers. It definitely isn't a freezing NYC weather jacket. If it were one of those 19 degree weather with -10 degree windchills, I'd wear something else. If it were in the mid-30s, I'd wear this. It's about the same thickness as my other jackets, but keep in mind that I typically wear layers underneath and I'm used to cold weather.\n\nThe only difficulty I had was the size. I would have gone with the US Small (The US Small were fitted for my sleeves, height, and chest.), but according to the measurements, the shoulders would have been too tight for my comfort (My shoulders are 45cm.). My shoulders were a perfect fit for the US Medium. I was taking into consideration that I'd be wearing layers, and Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's would be around when I'm wearing this jacket. I wanted to account that I would be gaining some extra fat. So, after much discussion with the seller, I decided to order the US Medium. They were very thorough with answering my question. I was basically at a choice of the jacket being pretty snug on the shoulders and a fitted everywhere else or the jacket being comfortable on the shoulders and a little loose everywhere else. I decided to go with the comfort on the shoulders and a little loose everywhere else and to just tailor everywhere else if I needed to. I was anticipating that I would have to tailor it to be a better fit. It turned out that it was a little more than a little loose. But that wasn't a problem because I was anticipating it anyways. At least my shoulders are just perfect. All I need to do is fix the waist and a little bit of the chest.\n\nAll in all, I'm happy with my purchase. If only there was a perfect size for me, I'd give it 5-stars. The whole shipment and delivery process was very fast. It took a week at most. I still need to figure out about that top pocket though, but I'm too scared to tear it open...not that I'd ever really use it.\n\nUpdated for 12/7/2013\nSo, I've worn this jacket in temperatures of low 40s (With minimal wind) with just a dress shirt and an undershirt underneath. The jacket is still keeping me warm. I got the jacket tailored to fit my waist and chest. The upper pocket looking thing is confirmed not to be a pocket along with the flap that is above one of the bottom pockets. But who cares? You still have to exterior pockets at the bottom, and an interior pocket.", "summary": "Good jacket", "unixReviewTime": 1380067200}

The dress listing is for multiple dresses, some of them work for the size chart, some do not. I ordered the Red dress. I ordered a size larger than I normally wear and measured very liberally to be safe. I wear a 10, ordered a 14, dress that arrived was roughly a 6/8.\nI had to return it, and have them send me a size 18\n\n2. When you do a return, you will have to be persistent about the tracking. They told me my return had not arrived even 2 days after it had, they refused to send the new dress \"until\" it arrived, and withheld it 3 days in total.\n\n3. They will make you pay the return shipping for a too-small item, then charge you the $24.99 shipping to send the new item, and they send it standard shipping, which should be less than $10.00\n\n4. Customer service is located in China, the only contact with them is via email, their English is poor and they make multiple excuses for delays. You will also only be able to email back and forth with them in the middle of the night if you are in the US.\n\n5. The dress is high quality, beautiful fabric, well made, looks stunning on, really was exactly what I wanted.\n\n6. The underskirt/fitted part of the dress does not extend to the thighs, the slit comes ALL the way up, and the skirting is completely sheer. As in, my hooha and rear were literally hanging out of the bottom of the dress and VERY visible through the sheer fabric. I had to add fabric to the interior of the dress, so only buy this if you have time to get it altered.\n\n7. The dress trails behind you, looks lovely, you won't be able to wear it with sequin-y heels as they will catch on the very delicate fabric, and you'll need to carry the end of the dress if you walk outside at all.\n\n8. Crystals on the bust in the sheer fabric are a lovely addition, it comes with detachable spaghetti straps, and if you're busty, you'll need those.\n\nIn summary:\n\nIt is a beautiful, sexy, fantastic dress, my hubby's jaw damn near hit the floor; BUT - Only order from them if you have the time, money and patience to wait for to arrive, try it on, have it not fit, do an exchange, and have the new dress they send to you a week or so later altered, before whatever event you're buying it for.", "summary": "THIS IS THE REVIEW YOU ******NEED TO READ****** BEFORE ORDERING ANY OF THIS COMPANY'S DRESSES", "unixReviewTime": 1410998400}

I LOVE the color/design and it makes it very easy to spot coming off the belt. I get people walking up to me in the airport all the time asking where I bought it.\nCONS - there are no front pockets to throw in last minute things (I always put my travel scale in there and now there is no pocket for it). Additionally, there are no spaces/pockets for a name tag. I place one on the handle and hope it isn't pulled off in transit.\n\nSo far I have used this set  on 14 international flights and it is holding up very well. 4 stars because of the few \"cons\" I mentioned, but overall a great product.", "summary": "Great product", "unixReviewTime": 1376870400}

I did follow the size chart. I bet I will be able to shrink the dress in the dryer after washing it.  I don't think the sizing is accurate. When I wore it I had to safety pin the back of it because it kept falling down over my chest. All day I kept readjusting myself; pulling it up over my chest, re-pinning it, tugging it over the belt. To much hassle to look good.  I should have just sent it back and exchanged it for a small. The small probably would have been perfect. Its too late now, I already wore it.

I had a lovely leather wallet on a strap that my lab chewed and destroyed and I have been searching for a replacement.  It is not easy to find, especially of leather.  My girlfriend pointed this one out to me.  It is very functional and easy to use as a cross body but it cannot be overloaded with credit cards.  Since it kept popping open (a disaster) I took out all my service cards i.e. Sam's club, library, pharmacy discount etc. and put them in a small card holder in my purse.  I only keep vital cards in this wallet such as ATM or credit cards I use often.  Now it works perfectly without popping open.  There is enough room for money, and several credit cards.  I love the back of it as it has two zippered compartments one for change and one for a cell phone and a lipstick.  It is fabric which means it doesn't \"give\" as well as leather but that is minor.  It is a much safer option than leaving your big bag in a shopping cart.  The print fabric on the inside isn't my style but it did not dissuade me from buying it.  Sometimes Vera has some wild prints....this is a zigzag design.", "summary": "Wallet with a Strap", "unixReviewTime": 1387065600}

It's a pain when you're riding at dusk with sunglasses on and there is no convenient place to pull over, so I thought these would be perfect.  Unfortunately, they don't get dark enough.  At their darkest, the lenses have what I would call a fashion tint.  They're OK except for really bright sunshine and glare.  Unfortunately, that's exactly what I need sunglasses for.  Love the frames, not crazy about the lenses.\n\nI think Kickbacks are the best sunglasses deal on the Internet.  They are rugged, the lenses don't scratch easily, are comfortable worn with a helmet (a rare quality in motorcycle glasses), and they fit my thin nose bridge.  These would be great on an overcast day or at dusk when you're not riding into the sun.  I'm going to make them my night glasses.\n\n12/7/13 Update:\nI actually use these glasses a lot.
