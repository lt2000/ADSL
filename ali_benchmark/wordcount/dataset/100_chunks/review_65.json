The purse measures close to 8\" in length x 4\" high.  It is patent leather, meaning, it always maintains the beautiful shine.  You can use this formally,  or very casually.  It works both ways.\n\nWhat is also a good feature is the carrying strap.  This is wide enough, you don't have to scrunch to get your arm through.  When I go into a large store, I always fear leaving my bag, so I just pop this on my arm and it stays!\n\nThere are two compartments, with zippers that flow easily.  The zippers have small metal pulls, making it easy to grab!  One side of the wallet is for the credit cards.  Each side of this credit card compartment has slots for the cards,  and.....  two spots to place dollar bills, without folding them.\n\nThe other side is where you can place a cell phone, ipod, etc.,  and there is a zipper for cash.\n\nVery attractive wallet, sufficient to hold a lot of cards, and other small necessities.

It is by far one of cutest CC purses I've seen. Most are ugly, plain, or boring. This is very pretty and very well made. I like that, unlike my previous CC purses, that it still holds its shape and stands upright when my firearm is placed in its pocket. The purse set up is nice for my liking. It's bigger than I had imagined. I made one small modification to it. The back pocket by the CC pocket, is very, very shallow. I wanted to use that as a phone pocket. But I have the iPhone 6 Plus which is already huge. The pocket is too shallow for probably most phones. I pulled the pocket out, cut across the very bottom and sewed an old (ugly) piece of fabric to it to extend its depth. Tucked it back in and now the pocket goes to the bottom of the purse. Wasn't hard at all and no one will ever see the ugly fabric or how bad my sewing is because it's tucked back in. Lol. The CC pocket holds a 9 mm Glock just perfect. There is no holster and I was concerned about that since my previous purses had holsters, but it is a very nice and comfortable fit. My ONLY real complaints are that the metal rings adds weight and a noise factor to this purse. The \"chains\" are noisy and it adds addition weight to the purse, especially if you are carrying your firearm. But none the less, it is a super cute, stylish, well made purse. And I've read on another review for another purse that they were easily able to add more of those metal loops from a craft store to add length to the shoulder straps. Right now I can carry it comfortably without a coat, but I have a feeling it would be a tad too short to carry over a coat. So adding the metal loops is a good thing to keep in mind.\nBut my most MAJOR praise goes to their CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! We had a small issue and since this is a third party seller, it couldn't be resolved through Amazon. Whoever I was dealing with was wonderful and on top of making it right. We just don't see good customer service anywhere these days and it was really nice to feel like I was important, so they were doing what they could do to make it right and make me happy. THANK YOU for that!!!!", "summary": "Awesome CUSTOMER SERVICE and I LOVE this purse!", "unixReviewTime": 1457568000}

OK, this shirt is beautiful to look at.  I waited about 5 weeks for it, so that was annoying, but I knew it would take a long time b/c it was coming from China.  I have such trouble with the Asian sizing--it confuses me what the US equivalent is, and I even know my measurements.  I ended up getting a 5XL!  I usually wear a large in US sizes.  And this is still pretty snug around my chest which is about 38 inches.  I love the appearance of this shirt--the style is really lovely, and I loved the color selection.  Problems are that it is so fragile--just taking it out of the package, I snagged the fabric on the shirt right off the bat.  There were loose strings and extra brocade just sticking out everywhere, so I had to take the scissors to it to fix that.  In other places, the lacey portion is a bit \"holey\"--little missing or ripped areas--not super noticeable, but makes me worry.  Got this caught in my hair clip putting it over my head, and it ripped a tiny bit more.  The arms are very long, but I'm 5'7, so not a big deal, but I will need to push up the sleeves when I wear it.  I want to put this on and go out, but it is so thin and delicate that I'm scared I'll catch it on something and it will rip right off me.  So I have to be careful where I wear it, and don't think I can wear a necklace with it (another snag possibility).  Have to wear a camisole underneath, as fabric is so thin it is practically see-through.  So it's pretty, but not practical.  I paid a low price on it, so I don't want to complain too much.  Also, as every item I have gotten from Asia, it had a gasoline-like smell.  I just sprayed some Febreeze on it and hung it out to air, & now it smells fine.  Just wish it was not so poorly made and delicate, or I would buy it in every color.", "summary": "Pretty, but not well-made", "unixReviewTime": 1456963200}

Ummm. My clothes haven't been that little in MAAANNNNYYY years.\n\nThen.... then I open the package and I see what I can only describe as a dress sized for a reeeeaaaallllllllyyyyyy tall toddler.\n\nI ordered a womens 3x.\n\nEVEN with the stretchy middle (which did NOT look that way on the site) this is in NO way fitting me. UGH!!!! Maybe I'll get another, take up stilt-walking and then I'll have a costume for each leg.\n\nOk, so in my pictures, you can see that my PLUS SIZE women's 3X dress measures less than 8 inches across (so less that's less than 16 inches around) - before stretch, which on this dress is not that much as the fabric is so thin and as transparent as you can get without being naked.

The maker of this ridiculous waste of money is Mei Li Jiao Yang, and there is no site for them. On Sammy Dress' site, my size chart shows that a dress in a 3X size should be 39.37 inches around. Now I'm no Astrophysicist, but it seems to me that we're missing around half the fabric. HALF a HUMAN BEING WORTH OF FABRIC!!!!\n\nBesides the fact that this is COMPLETELY MISREPRESENTED in size, the pattern is NOTHING like it shows on the page. I've added photos to show what I mean. The entire draw of this dress is that the patterning of the peacock feathers meanders down the body. Nope. Not the one I was shipped. Besides being sized for a tall 4 year old, this has a telltale crap clothing store way of sharply stopping right under where the boobs should be (which I cannot confirm or deny since there is no way I can get this on) and there is a huge 'make you look 10 months pregnant band of black elasticized (albeit see through) fabric.\n\nTo say that I'm disgusted is the understatement of the year.", "summary": "a 3x would fit a tall 4 year old.

The fabric is thick enough to touch but giving enough to stretch (minimally) and is exceedingly soft. The colors are bright and deep with very sturdy stitching with very attractive buttons (etched with the logo) with very few loose strings needing a bit of trimming. The sleeve length is adequate to your normal tailored shirt but when manufactured they are less than a quarter inch shorter but again the length is not even an issue just setting the idea of the overall product. The collar is very sturdy a bit thick but responds well to ironing or steaming as it is not reinforced but simply the thick fabric yet the sturdy fabric holds the collar in place when unbuttoned.\n\nSecond the sizing: HARD TO GET BUT AMAZING WHEN ITS RIGHT\nMy first order I followed the direction \"two sizes larger than your normal purchased shirt\" which I understood as I have had many disasters ordering from other online stores which will remain nameless (but I wll tell you their name is a combination of a public place to keep animals and a flower) of sizing with measurements provided but your final product won't even fit your preteen brother...so I ordered two sizes too large...when I received the product it was in fact two sizes too large for me. I like my button up shirts on the slimmer side even when they are not buttoned up as I am in front of many people on a Daily basis and I gots to look good (sorry for the euphemism but it's the most apt description of how I need to look). But when looking at their ordering advice it stands true...if you want a shirt that fits off the rack and has a good bit of room in it then follow directions however for us taller slimer rockers (6'1\" at 160lbs) your standard size should suffice for the slim and sleek look (even with the tagging altered from normal sizes). now as I ordered the XL I could tell its was a tad smaller than your standard US made XL but again by a very small amount. The length is perfect for tucking in and just long enough to leave flowing. The collar feels normal for US sizing and feels good when buttoned.\n\nIf it's a work shirt: 2 Sizes up (Standard)\nIf it's a casual shirt: 1-2 sizes up (Per preference Normal-Slim)\nIf it's a statement shirt: Standard Size-1 size up (Preference Slim to Slender)\n\nOverall:\nI had to return my first purchase as I have been looking for this shirt for some time and standard shirts off the rack were terrible from every store I visited (disappointing). I am OVERLY impressed with this product and the seller and will continue to purchase from This company as long as they remain in business. I have very STRICT tastes and it is rare for me to fall in love with clothing unless it looks absolutely perfect on me in every aspect. If you have any questions I can answer them to the fullest and hope you are just as pleased with the purchase as I am.\n\nKEEP MAKING THEM APTRO ILL KEEP BUYING THEM!!!", "summary": "SIZING IS EVERYTHING!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1464652800}

It is good quality leather, very well-made with gorgeous details. The matching wallet is slender, has its own carry strap for when you want to travel light, and it is a total bonus for this price.\n\nThere are just a couple of things that could functionally be better. The description says the purse is 12\"w x 9\"h, which it is when measured to the top of the scalloped top. But the main zipper closure is 3 1/2\" below the top of the scallop, making the actual storage area of the purse much smaller, really only 5 1/2\" high. (Note to the manufacturer that the zipper really doesn't have to be that far down. It could be at least another 1 1/2\" closer to the top to give more capacity without sacrificing the appearance.)\n\nThe outside cell phone pocket is too shallow to comfortably accommodate today's smartphones.\n\nThe gun compartment is amply sized to accommodate my compact semi-auto pistol. However, it lacks a holster and the soft inside lining allows for too much movement. So I used a velcro-sided holster from another bag to add structure but will have to add some loop velcro to the lining of the compartment so it stays put when drawing.\n\nAgain, this is a gorgeous, well-made bag with just a few functional flaws. I still love it and get lots of compliments!", "summary": "Gorgeous, well-made bag with just a few functional flaws", "unixReviewTime": 1453939200}

Perhaps those that thought it ran large are large busted, and the bottom half was too big?  I was also not thrilled with the light purple color I bought, it was a muted shade and didn't suit my skin tone.  One final note- if this is a tighter fit on you, it shows every little imperfection.

The faux-leather surface has a convincing 'slightly worn' character that's neither overly glossy (and cheap-looking) nor completely dull and flat. It's a kind of 'dressy backpack' that I think both men and women would be comfortable wearing on occasions where appearing too casual may be a concern. It's quite light when empty and feels well-balanced when strapped on.\n\nThe 3 1/2\" zipper handle loops make open/close really easy, especially when reaching over your shoulder. The zippers have a smooth sliding action (I like to rub a little candlewax on them to keep it that way). There's also plenty of clearance along the sides to avoid jamming with the main pack material. The velcro strips on the large main flap and inner compartment divider are great ideas.\n\nThe support pads on the shoulder straps don't have much padding but I don't think this bag is designed to be stuffed with overly heavy loads. It's quite comfortable enough for a tablet rather than a larger, heavier laptop. I wish the carry handle on the top were both wider - my large hands feel a bit cramped - and had more padding. There are times when there's no choice but to carry a backpack and that handle needs to feel both secure and comfortable.\n\nThe main pounch itself appears from the outside to be pleated but it actually isn't, or at least not much. The small side pouches are perhaps useful for stuffing a pen, comb or brush in, but not much else - too hard to reach down into.\n\nBottom Line: An attractive pack suitable for 'more than casual' occasions and appropriate for light to moderate loads.", "summary": "Looks Stylish / Good For Light Loads", "unixReviewTime": 1437264000}

We only agree to these requests when it's something we would actually use. The fact we received them for free has no bearing on our review, and we have written negative reviews in the past for products we were sent for free. But we tend to accept more review invitations for quality products, so that's why many of these invited reviews have high ratings. Also, for this type of invited review, we always begin with a disclaimer.)\n\nIf you want to use this backpack for laptops or tablets, it doesn't provide enough cushion protection, so you're better off using it to carry other things that aren't as fragile.\n\nThe craftsmanship is shoddy. My wife had to cut several loose threads from the bad sewing, and the vecro was crooked and the two parts didn't even match in position, so she had to remove them, realign them, and then sewn them back. When's the last time you had to do that with a backpack?\n\nThere are no compartmentalized pockets of different sizes that hold individual items like pens, flash drive, keys, phones, etc. You only get one basic open pocket that cannot be sealed.\n\nThe zippers are terrible too. They are very rough and do not glide smoothly, and they get caught by the front lip of the backpack's interior constantly, so you have to make an extra effort to clear the zipper's path of that front lip in order to pull the zipper all the way to the closed position.\n\nOverall, it's a disappointing backpack. We just throw it in the backseat of our car and use it to to hold a couple of spare shirts, an umbrella, and a little first aid box.

At first I wasn't sure about the less- than- snug fit I am used to in nylons or tights, but after wearing them for an entire evening, I realized that not only does this contribute to their comfort but this also helps keep the pattern straight, which doesn't always happen on a large- weave print in hosiery.\n\nI got these in black and they are a nice dark black so they will be perfect for almost everything I wear.  The seam on the toes is a bit heavy, but I realized how important this is on this weave after the evening of wear because my toes would other wise poke through the large weave.  I wore closed toed shoes, so I am not sure how an open toed shoe would work with that seam.  I'll give it a try and see how it turns out.\n\nI only docked one star because the waist band is a bit loose.  This probably should not be a big surprise because they are not by any means a control- top fit, but they are not advertised to be either. That being said,  I did not have any trouble with them sagging, which was my concern.\n\nAll in all, I do like these and I am considering purchasing them in a nude tone as well, they are so lovely.\n\nThis product was purchased at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Beautiful Pattern, Light Weight and Attractive", "unixReviewTime": 1455062400}

The dress is very well made and the fabric is substantial (albeit heavy). I was concerned with the fit as I generally wear a 2/4/XS in most dresses and although a Small would have probably fit, I am glad I purchased the Medium. Similar to another Meilun dress I purchased, this dress definitely hugs your figure and the medium allows me to move around with relative comfort. A few things to note. I will probably have to insert some form of cutlets, inserts at the chest area. The chest has light cupping and molded forming that I felt that for someone as flat chested as I am, that a little lift/help from some inserts may just fill the chest area lend some balance to the fluted bottom. The fit at the chest is just a tiny bit loose for me, however for anyone with a B cup or above, this probably will not be a problem. I will probably get a few stitches places along the seam under the armpits just for my own personal security (the dress does have some \"sticky\" support on the interior side of the top of the dress).", "summary": "Beautiful, Well Made Dress - Beats Paying $350 for Bandage Dress at BCBG", "unixReviewTime": 1468886400}

I ordered based on my measurements for this swimsuit, the bottoms fit fine and the top is crap. I've still not heard anything back from the company and emailed them the day I received the swimsuit to find out about exchange/return.\n\nI really love the swimsuit and have been looking for this swimsuit for ever. however, I followed the size chart to a T. I wear a size 8-10 in a swimsuit, so I ordered a 10-12 (as I figured this was made in china), I received this suit today and lets just say my daughter in law who wears a size 2 just barely fits in the top.\n\nThe image of the model is deceiving, it appears her breasts are larger and the top has a more fuller coverage than it does. In order for me to be able to buy this swimsuit I will have to purchase this at a size 5x yes a 5X. that is completely NOT true to size --it's bad enough that a 10-12 is considered a 2x for this brand...

Unfortunately, I won't be wearing this to the beach any time soon, unless there's some weight loss involved to get the top to fit.  I'm disappointed, because it is super cute, and my husband says I look super cute in it.\n\nDISCLAIMER:\nI received this product from the seller at a discount in exchange for an honest review.", "summary": "A little small", "unixReviewTime": 1459382400}

I freaking LOVE IT. I was seriously anticipating just getting a good laugh seeing myself in the mirror, but I was shocked at how flattering this suit is (5'3, 170 lbs, 36B). The ruched bottoms disguise any lumps or bulges, the top fits well and is very supportive and comfortable. The top is *rather* padded though, so while that works for me, just be aware... The bottoms fit well, they don't roll down when I walk around or sit in them for a while. Seriously, if you're considering purchasing a bikini-style suit but you're just not sure you're confident enough to rock it, try this one. I can't wait to hit the beach for the first time this season!

Every time I've tried a diet I've thought \"this is the year I wear a bikini\". It's never happened. I'm not almost 35 and decided several months ago to change my eating habits and diet, and have developed a love of the gym. I've also been a roller derby player for 5 years now. I started losing inches the past few months and when I saw this I thought \"ah, what the heck.\" I didn't think I'd be able to wear it till summertime (I mean, I live in Colorado so obviously I wouldn't be able to), but I figured I'd get it now to see how much more I need to lose. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that I could wear it now if it wasn't blizzarding outside right now. :) The color is really pretty, the material is not flimsy at all, and the top fits my 38 in-between-C-and-D cups. The back and top of the top tie, and I do wish that the back was a hook or something else a little easier to connect, but that's probably just because I'm not used to bikini tops since I've never worn one before. I ended up posting a pic of me in this when I tried it on because I was so excited about it, and got rave reviews from friends and family. It's worth the money, beyond worth it. The bottom is snug enough to feel secure (and I have a large behind naturally), and the front has some sort of design I am not sure what it's called that hides tummy (which I still have for now). I love this suit. I have several friends who ordered it just because it looks so great. One thing though, as everyone else has said, ORDER TWO SIZES UP. I based my original size as a Large (12/14) which is what I'm currently wearing and upped it twice to an XXL and it is PERFECT. So make sure you do the same. I would give this suit a thousand stars if I could. :)\n\nI received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review, but that doesn't mean I give everything I receive 5 stars.

I usually have a stomach (I'm not one of those flat-stomach girls) so the loose fabric isn't too bad for me. The cap sleeve is sheer and adorable, and the dress is not see-through so it's safe to wear and made of nice quality fabric. It's flowy and feminine and falls a bit above my knees. The inner lining (dress?) is made of a silk-ish material and feels nice. There is a weird thing though; underneath the black, middle band, there will be slight bulging as the seam for the torso and the skirt part of the inner dress are sewn together there. Because the dress is loose for me, there is no bulging, but I pulled it taut to see what happens and it creates a line all around your waist. It's not a problem because the black middle part covers it, but it's a sheer black and if someone looks hard at you, they'll probably notice it.

I find if the pockets are too lose or don't have enough room that you're wasting your time with trying to load it up with stuff to carry. I don't like the idea of in the middle of a trip, stuff starts tumbling out onto the floor of your car depending on where you're at and how you're using the bag. Something else I've always been very strict on is how the straps work, feel, and are constructed.\n\nThis messenger bag has a very nice feeling strap and the closure of the bag is a nice leather with magnetic latches. Something else that I appreciate is that the main compartment of the bag has a zipper to keep it closed. So you don't have to worry about the contents spilling out everywhere.\n\nThey say this bag is for both men and women, but in my opinion, it feels like it would be better suited for a woman. For me personally, I would prefer to have a bag with padding to carry my tablet or laptop. The canvas constriction is very nice and I think it will last for a long time. I would have liked to see the inside of the bag be a lighter color to make it easier for people to find items laying inside of the bag.\n\n\"This product was received at a free or discounted price in exchange for my review.

I ordered 2 that were slightly different styles and I was excited to wear them. I have to wear a uniform to work and it's super plain but the good news is the bottom of it is a skirt so I was looking forward to having something cute to wear with it. So now the bad news... The anklet randomly broke after being at work for only 2 hours. My co-worker actually found it on the ground and gave it to me. I'm a cocktail waitress at a resort so I walk around a lot all night, but nothing I do should have caused it to just fall off so quickly.\n\nWhen I got home I was able to take a closer look at it and quickly noticed one of the end pieces where the clasp was had broken off. I probably could have easily had it fixed but the price was so low I figured oh well I'll just wear the other one tomorrow night. So the next night I wore the second one but this time it fell off after about 20 minutes at work. I I looked around and found it pretty quickly in the middle of the floor again  and sure enough  the same exact thing happened!\n\nTwo things,  first; the saying you get what you pay for is So true with these anklets. They were very poorly  made. Secondly, I noticed that the clasp used to hold it together was way too small for the anklet. It actually looked like it was from a necklace or bracelet made for a child. I could see why it probably just pulled apart super easy. So unless you're into buying disposable jewelry I would strongly recommend paying a little bit more for a better quality piece of jewelry. Very disappointing. '", "summary": "Disappointed!", "unixReviewTime": 1476057600}

Not as described or pictured at all. I thought I would get the same cute turban style soft headbands as pictured but instead I got this weird, random, dollar store looking assortment of bows with random flowers glued onto them. Flower headbands are usually cute but these ones are not at all. The problem is it isn't just a single flower on each bow but several of clashing colors jammed up next to each other and glued together. It looks so tacky. I will not be using it and can't even give it as a gift because it looks so bad. I'll probably just throw it in the trash. I usually don't ever leave one star reviews but this is ridiculous. I contacted the seller and no reply. I hope they get it sorted out because it is so disappointing. Stay away! There are other sellers on Amazon that sell headbands that look almost exactly the same and probably actually deliver as promised. Also these ones don't even look safe for a baby to wear because they are scratchy, fraying and falling apart before I even used them and I can see the glue all over. At least the turban style would have been one piece and soft. I purchased this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. What a waste of my money and time!

Clark", "reviewText": "I had to look around a lot to find a tuxedo shirt cut for a woman.  This one fits almost perfectly, except the sleeves are a bit long.  The material is not too thin, but not super thick either; the pleating in front offers more coverage. Unless you plan on wearing a jacket or an undershirt, certain color bras might show through the fabric.\n\n  Also, not sure what the deal was with mine, but the shirt had quite a few stray threads that I needed to trim off before wearing it.  Fortunately, none of the seams look like they are fraying or coming apart, it just looked a little sloppy out of the packaging.\n\n  The buttons on this shirt are a bit strange to me, but I guess it is meant to offer flexibility: the shirt has two sets sewn on.  The topmost button on the collar is white.  The next four buttons down allow you to pick between smaller black buttons and white buttons.  The last three buttons are white, but it appears as though there are only two button holes, so you can't button up the very bottom one. (Maybe it is meant as a spare? It's far enough down so it will be tucked in, so doesn't really matter.)  The cuffs can be worn buttoned (just the white buttons on the cuffs) or with cuff links.  I noticed that when I wore it with all the white buttons showing, the shirt had a little bit of a wrinkle near the bottom, like the cloth is aligned slightly off when it is worn that way.", "summary": "Fits well, but had a good deal of stray threads that needed to be cut off.", "unixReviewTime": 1441756800}

I've got a pear-shaped body and am usually a US size 2X/20 in UK and European clothing, 3X in Torrid and most clothing made in China--plus sizing seems to be all over the place, there is no standard. But I did figure 3X in these dresses would fit well. Not so--a little too snug for my liking across the waist and stomach area, although plenty full through the hips. One other thing--I was glad I bought several colors because some were cut a little larger than others and did fit great.\n--Also wish the neck were cut a little lower like their tank-style dresses.\n--Length is too long--a couple of inches below the knee if you're under 5' 4\".\n--Unless the dress is offered in Prime, it can take up to 3 weeks to be delivered (from Hong Kong).", "summary": "Terrific dresses with a few drawbacks", "unixReviewTime": 1467158400}

I am 5'7, 120 lbs and am very flat chested (size 36 A) and it fits me perfectly on top. It is a bit stretchy so a slightly bigger person could easily get away with this size, although it would be more form fitting. The only draw back was the length, I was shocked at how long it was, which is better then to short. I had to cut about 4 inches off the bottom.

The bust just fits me, but has enough give in the fabric to be comfortable (great for busty girls, I am 45\").  The fabric curves in and is tighter under my bust and gives me a waistline with tummy control, and still covers my derrire.\n\nI haven't washed it yet, but plan to wash on hand-wash cycle in cold water, and gently stretch to shape before hanging or lay flat to dry.

I have always had large breasts (I'm a 36 DD-36 DDD now, when I weighed around 128-135 I was a Size 32-34 D), have small hips and thin legs but carry extra weight in my mid section. I couldn't get the romper over my thighs. So you get the idea. The Large isn't even close to a US Large. Second flag, the fabric is sheer. You will definately be able to see ur bra and panties. The front is a V, completely open, (kind of like an opening u would get from a wrap around dress that's cut to low), so regardless of your size, you will either completely show your bra, (larger chests will \"push\" out the opening even more), will have to wear something under it (will look awful with this style), or pin it which you ll def see and will mostly still be open.  The print on the fabric is okay, nothing special.", "summary": "price great, may be cute on teenagers but though it appears attractive for an older group, noooo..skip it!", "unixReviewTime": 1453680000}

We were getting ready to go to a 50s dance hall. My friend would have preferred the dress in red, but they didn't have red in size XXXL. I ordered that size for her, because she's gained a few pounds and I worried about it being too small for her and her not having anything to wear to the dance. It turned out to fit perfectly, but was slightly big on her. She's a little over 200lbs and is 5'9\" with DD cups. She ordered sea green, because she wanted the dress to match her eyes. The green was a bit darker and not so flattering when it arrived in the mail, and although my friend expressed gratitude, I knew she would have preferred the red. She said next time, she will get a red in one size smaller, an XXL. (For this dress, I gave the review 4 stars).\n\nComment for my blue with white polka dotted dress in size XXL (fit exactly as expected): The dress arrived two years ago in the mail almost immediately after I ordered it. I tried it on and it fit like a glove. It was the most beautiful dress I ever owned, and I ordered a blue petticoat to go with it. It fit perfectly in the bosom, waist, back and side area and it was the perfect length and cut along the bust area. The sleeves were perfect as was the fabric, the color, and every other thing about it. I was a size 14 then with a 36A bust, standing at 5'6\" and 175lbs.

I am at 154 and these in a four fit great. They are med weight, stretchy fabric. NOT SEE THROUGH!!!!!! (Yasssss) the stretch keeps them fitted but overly tight(in feel or looking). Smooth and rich in black hue. even after years of washing my old pairs have only begin to fade and the center leg seam has popped in some places but I can still wear them. I got news to rotate with some new wardrobe items. I got my first two at Macy's, in the women's department. The sizes are in women's but the stretch means you should maybe go down a size from what you think you should because the waist needs to waist to stay up and be comfortable. Thy are long, even wearing them on pulled up my belly button, there is length (maybe 34\"inseam) so if you are any shorter than me be careful. They are skinny fitted enough that I they work for me in my high too shoes or with heels but these are not ankle grazing at all, nor can you rolled(it looks werid).they are meant to be worn high waist ( on or just below your belly button. The waist is a thick band so be mindful that if you have a tummy they may be small on top.

Though it is not the largest backpack I have seen and used, it is a very good one and I really like it. There is only one thing about it that I would suggest as an improvement.\n\nThis is a heavy canvas bag with leather trim elements that is designed to hold up under heavy use. The canvas material is very thick and heavy, the stitching is strong and overall the whole bag is assembled well. I have found no issues with loose threads, uneven seams or crooked materials.\n\nThe main compartment is large and deep and is sufficient for holding most laptops. There is even a divider inside that is good for keeping a laptop or tablet separate from the rest of the open area. Now, that said, this bag offers little in the way of padding so while it is set up for carrying a laptop it is not ideal for such. It is also not heavily reinforced on the bottom (though there is some extra enforcement that can be felt on the bottom if you feel inside) and this is the one area where I believe this bad could be improved: a leather layer on the bottom would add strength and make it last longer.\n\nIn addition to a drawstring-style closure, the main compartment can be covered by a flap sewn on the bag that snaps down when folded over the main compartment. This flap actually snaps down and does not use magnets like I have seen in a lot of other bags, and while this is worth mentioning it is neither positive nor negative.\n\nThis bag has multiple zippered pockets: one on each side of the outside of this bag and two small pouches on the inside. Each of the zippers on the outside are metal and they seem to work well and very smoothly. The inside zippers are plastic but they also seem to be very smooth in operation.\n\nThere are actually two dividers inside this bag so in theory you can carry two laptops as well as books and keep everything separate. While possible, it is not advisable.\n\nOverall, this is a nice, heavy duty bag that is made very well. I like the construction, the appearance and the feel. If I could change one thing I would reinforce the bottom of the bag; otherwise, this bag is a solid offering.\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

The gray is slightly tighter than the black, almost too small. The strap across the shoulders is really cute and gives this top a little extra style. The order arrived way ahead of schedule. The shirts had a weird chemical odor in the package, but I hung outside in the sun and breeze for a couple of hours and it was gone. Fabric is nice quality and not sheer or flimsy.

Unlike other shirts I've seen in the past that have these inserts, you cannot see the outline of them at all in this top.  They actually seem larger than most, where they feel as though they take up the entire width of the portion that covers your breast.  They do not appear to be accessible for removal or anything but you also can not even tell that it has them simply by looking at the top.  It was not until i actually felt it and put it on that i realized.  It is great because you obviously can not wear a bra, nor do you need to with the thickness of the fabric/ lining.  The fit is perfect and actually provides a little more coverage over the breast area than I expected, but not too much of course.  Very sexy top and extremely comfortable and of course you can't beat this price.

The dial to set the time is on the top, directly above where the 12 would be, hidden almost under the band, which could be cumbersome for some, but I like that it isn't visible to the naked eye. It makes the watch appear more sleek.\n\nFor those that like to stand out and also have an appreciation for art, this is a great watch and conversation piece/peace. I have already received compliments on it, and once you explain what it means people love it even more. I plan on purchasing more and adding to my Time-Peace collection.  I received this product as a free promotional item in exchange for my review.\n\nHighly recommend!", "summary": "Great Conversation Piece/Peace", "unixReviewTime": 1437955200}

What is with Oakley and UA turning out great products and then rapidly ceasing production a-la \"fast fashion\".  This is a polyester workout/casual shirt that is lightweight, soft, has good wicking and almost perfect cut for athletic movement.  It's a great shirt to lift weights, play basketball or kick back and watch TV in.  The medium fit true to size (5'11\" 175lbs).  I have a black one that was almost too short in the body, but otherwise perfect fit.  The blue one that I got on Amazon (after realizing Oakley quit production), pleasantly, had a longer body but the same chest, arms, neck, and overall cut.\n\nI also own the two closest shirts in Oakley's current lineup that seem to have succeeded this shirt.  They both are less comfortable (not as soft, not cut quite the same) and one is actually cut in such a way that make athletic movements feel restricted, particularly in the arms.  This older, out of production shirts beats its replacements hands down.\n\nIf you can find one in your size, I highly recommend it as a comfy workout or even lightweight casual shirt. That said, the one I received from the Amazon seller did seem to be a \"2nds\" quality.  It had several threads that were starting to run and the bottom body hem, besides running, seemed to have somehow been \"shaved\" and after the first wash, the whole hem is coming undone.  I own a black and grey one and didn't have the loose strings/hem problem on either of those (those were purchased from Oakley direct and Galls, respectively.  Also, the amazon purchase, while appearing new, didn't have the tags and original packaging that the other 2 did.\n\nBut, with Oakley ceasing production, slim pickins are left.

The sewing, esp on the lace panels is excellent, however, I do wish there were pockets, side seam or even visible ones. The lace edge is hemmed with a strip of the main fabric on the inside and the top of the lace panel is edged with a closely matching fabric tape which is a nice touch. I gave this 4 instead of five stars for the placement on the lace as every time I wear this, the lace gets caught on something, like a coffee table corner or something on the ground. It brings me to a quick halt as I don't want the lace to tear. My size was actually only a little small, since the style is so loose and has lots of fabric anyways. It's just the elastic waist is a bit tight getting it on as a pull-on style.. I have tried gathering up the sides of the legs a bit and it adds a sweeter look, the full fabric almost looks like bows. Then it looks more like what I wanted -- a vintage-looking divided skirt. I may wear ankle boots with it or some cotton leggings with ruffles if it isn't too costumish. I haven't tried washing these yet, but I don't see a problem since I hand wash a lot of my linen clothes.", "summary": "Sweet-looking, flowy, supple linen WIDE pants are easy to love!", "unixReviewTime": 1490400000}

This one, perfect.  All silk, I am wearing right now.  Am going to sink-wash it with a dab of shampoo.  Considering trying other products from same company made from same strong silk.  For me this is the greatest tank for work (under blazer, cardigan) that I have tried in my modern era (after turning 40, haha; now, in '60s.)  So you pay couple bucks more and get a real garment that unless you need LONGER, will turn back the clock for you!", "summary": "Love this so much I can't even stand it.", "unixReviewTime": 1456790400}

Kaval", "reviewText": "The picture shows a skirt that is able to have quite a bit of flounce to it.  This is not the case.  The dress is A line from neck (think triangle).  I'd say it gives about 1/3 of the diameter of the bottom of the skirt show in the picture.  There are several other submitted pictures.  It was cut tighter to the waist than expected, but was still A line.  Much more traditional A line than the picture overexertion which looks comfortable for even ballet moves or martial arts! The orange color is accurate.  It has a nice liner to it so it's not see through (There are 2 layers, a see through one and thick fo-satin material).  Both layers are true to color and both are cut to the same A line. The satin layer stops 6 inches or so before the see through layer (midcalf). There were no care instructions on the tag.  There wasn't even a designer's name on the tag, just the cotton tag with the size at the neckline.  The neckline is tighter than expected which causes the lie to be more of a Tshirt lie than a boat-neck, which was fine.  The apertures for the arm holes were snug on my frame, which is a first, especially given the cut of the dress, however this worked well for me as it didn't show my undergarments that way at all.  Worked fine with size DD, but larger may reduce the fit in the top, so be cautious.  As for length it was fine for 5'11 to ankle.  It, of course, doesn't come with the black belt, but instead had a thing cord made of the same see through material.  There are no belt loops, which is fine for an hourglass figure, but may challenge a column or a pear.  Mentioning this for those who may be curious.  I have not washed the item yet and will be dry cleaning it only as I'm in love with the color.  It was a spot on fall orange.  Exactly what I wanted.  This was a knock off and absolutely NOT the photo in the dress, but a recreation.  The photo is not the dress, given the diameter of the bottom.  However they did make it well.  And were mostly correct and I like it!  Edited to include the photos.  One to show the neckline.  One to show the see through layer/over the satin layer, another to show the reduced diameter of the skirt, and lastly to show the belt.

It may be good to wear under a blazer where it is kind of hidden. The color in the product image does look like the shirt I received.

I found that the Bora sunglasses were a perfect solution. I tried other bifocal sunglasses from the drug store, but they were flimsy and gave a weird distortion when walking. I notice a big difference with these glasses. Firstly the bifocal is nearly invisible. I don't notice the bifocal line which caused blurred vision in other glasses. I like the glass shade it is a smoke grey not so dark that I can't see indoors. I can see better with the Bora sunglasses.  I did not have to adjust what I was reading to be able to see.  I could pretty much look at it normally and be able to read it. No more find the \"sweet spot\" when trying to read.  The glasses are sturdy and well made. They fit snugly I like the spring hinge. No more constantly putting my glasses back in place. I love them so much I will probably but a second pair just in case I lose them.", "summary": "Bora bifocal sunglasses have made my job easier.", "unixReviewTime": 1447545600}

After his alcohol fueled testimonial at Easter, I finally took the advice. I won't go back. The whole concept of the ratchet belt is awesome as you can cinch to basically whatever in-between size your waist might be instead of being stuck with only where the holes of a traditional belt are. The quality of the belt buckle alone is worth double the price. The sizing is a little strange and even though the description has it as a 110, the belt itself is actually marked 125 which is apparently what I needed anyway.

It was a synthetic fabric, that's for sure; polyester, I believe. But the kind of polyester that's reminiscent of a table cloth, like it could be wiped clean with a damp towel.

This dress is not as bad as other reviews say this outfit is. I'm a size 10-12 (measurements 40-32-38, and I carry my weight in my stomach) and the skirt sits high on my natural waist as I believe it's supposed to do. It fits me, but I probably can't put on anymore weight and have it still fit. The top isn't perfect, but the side-boob I get from it looks good and it wears in a way that I will not be flashing anyone. I can't wear a bra with it, not even one of those front-only bras as it would show on the side. It will need to be washed first to get the square packing wrinkles out of it before public wear.

I've worn this bra about three times a week for 8 full hours for the past 3 months, and let me tell you, the adhesive is still as adhesive as the first time I wore the bra and washing the bra only makes the adhesive feel like new again (I was afraid it would make it worse).

I normally never wear normal bras. I love sports bras. The thing about sports bras is that they sometimes are thin, and this means \"you know what\" sometimes can show. These covers are thin enough that you can't feel a bulge through your shirt, and you don't have to worry about being embarrassed. Another use I've found helpful is if you have nipple chaffing. These will protect your nipples while running or going about your way, so your nipples won't be irritated. I like the variet in this pack, you can use this with a dress, bathing suits, or whatever you want to use it for.\n\nYou will need to position your body the way you want it and then stick these in place. I haven't used them a while lot, but you need to keep yourself clean and the silicon adhesive portion clean if you want them to retain their sticking ability for a long time. These feel very much like human skin, so they feel natural.\n\nThis is a nice little starter set. It probably is a must-have item for women who like to wear strapless and shoulderless a lot.\n\nCheck out my video pending approval.\n\nI did receive this for free, but my thoughts and opinions are 100% my own.", "summary": "Nice little set.....", "unixReviewTime": 1471132800}

They were almost... ALMOST, everything I wanted them to be: They were light-weight, thin and not hot, and in colors that suited my existing wardrobe. I needed to be comfortable and jeans just weren't doing it for me in the last few months.\nThey arrived in good condition and very prompt. I was very pleased with that.\n\nThey were shorter than I wanted, and I expected that to a degree, everything is shorter than I wish it to be (Don't get me started on the barbie-doll-sized counter tops in my apartment bathroom!!). But these were ridiculously short. They came to just below the knee unless I wore them a little lower than normal, but to do that I needed a very long shirt to hide the belly enough to be suitably dressed. They were also too tight. Usually I do not mind a little form fitting, but I am pregnant and I wanted COMFORT and formfitting is not usually comfortable. Neither was it in this skirt; it is very tight. The skirts fit like a regular LARGE size, no where near big enough for a reasonably sized woman in her last trimester. Not. At. ALL. I am very disappointed and crushed really. The reviews warned over size, and I went up as per warning, and it STILL did not work out well for me. All three skirts do not fit at all.\n\nIt was so bad I gave them to my 13 yr old daughter. The tags had already been clipped in my desire to try them on without being poked or scratched (I have delicate skin). This was to my detriment and it served as a lesson learned. To have lost all three skirts is really crushing disappointment. She loves the skirts, again they were purchased for their comfort and they do look amazing on her.\nWord of caution, they are a little thin in lighted areas. I have her wear a full length slip underneath to help block that a bit. They really are lovely skirts otherwise.\n\nI did find an amazing coral skirt from this company. i ordered turquoise, but when it didn't arrive they sent me a coral one to replace it. That was disappointing as I had wanted blue/navyblue/turquiose, andy color along those lines (I'm having a boy after all) and the pink had been the last choice I had wanted. But it fits AMAZINGLY well!!! I adore the fit, form, weight, and comfort it gives me. It is\n\nBeachcoco Women's Maternity High Waisted Fold Over Maxi Skirt size XL\n\nThe larger/longer waist allows me to wear it as a normal skirt and it is LONG enough for me! For me, the giant! It comes to my ankles and it is thin and keeps me so cool I've reached for a lap blanket more than once this winter. I love that! It will be PERFECT for summer and wonderful in spring and fall! Its coral, though... I am currently asking them if they will get black and brown and well a few other colors in that size and style since it is SUCH a wonderful skirt! Admittedly I am hypocritically gouache and decline to wear a slip underneath, but it is SO COMFORTABLE!!! Why ruin it?! lol\nSO find that better skirt and you should be good to go.\nSuch a pity I'd found this pathetic skirt first. Go to the link and good luck!!", "summary": "Horrible fit.

After a good bit of use I've found that the weak spot is that the plastic loops will pop undone every once in awhile if you catch a tag at an odd angle under something heavy, like another piece of luggage, and pry the loop at an odd angle while trying to pick up your luggage out of a pile. It's not a frequent issue but has happened to me twice now, no damage to the tag/loop though. Another downside is that the paper inserts are not protected from rain, which could get to be a pain if you travel a lot.
