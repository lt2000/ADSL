I'm not really sure how because inspection did not show any edges or catches anyplace so it may just be me. Besides that, I still like the band. Its light and feels better than most metal bands to wear since it adjusts to your wrist like fabric.\n\nAlso, there were not any instructions on how to adjust the band length, I did figure out that its a spring action under the clasp that you use to pop up and just slide to the position that you want and then pop down the spring metal. Don't be tempted to take it apart, just pry up the spring and slide to the right length.\n\nOne thing I noticed, there is a small notch on one side, where the pin fits in that is used to attach the watch to the band. That notch allows you to use the included tool to take the band off but the other side of my band did not have the same notch, so getting that side off and on is a little harder to do.

What is the point of the button/brooch? I guess it's purely decorative but it's misleading.\n\nI don't know if I'm going to keep this. If I keep it then that means I have to risk ruining it by somehow cutting a hole on the other end of the wrap so the button/brooch can hold it together without me manually holding on to it - which was the look I wanted.

My daughter wears a US small (6-8) and we ordered a large. It was a wee bit on the big side right out of the bag, but after tossing it into the washer and dryer (on warm) it drew up just enough to fit well. We might have been able to get by with a medium, but I suspect it would have been too tight to look good. The sizing chart states that a large is equivalent to a US 8-10, however, and I'd say that's probably not too far off.\n\nThis JNTWorlld Fashion Celeb Ladies Button Formal dress is made of a lightweight cotton knit, and is extremely soft. It's definitely a summer-weight fabric, so if you live in a cold climate you'll want to layer it with tights, a slip, etc., when the thermometer dips. My daughter says it feels like she's wearing a nightgown. Despite the comfort level and fabric weight, it looks professional. It strikes her just below the knee, making it appropriate for work, and surprisingly hangs well and does not cling. As I mentioned before, it's simple to toss it into the washer and dryer and it comes out wrinkle-free and soft. I would recommend hanging it up right away though - since the fabric is a cotton jersey knit if you let it sit in the dryer I can't vouch for the wrinkle-free factor.\n\nWe ordered the lighter blue version and there was no sign that the blue color faded onto the white trim when it was washed in warm water. The trim itself is a textured ribbon, and the buttons have kind of a shell-look finish. All in all, as long as you buy this larger than your normal size, it's a terrific wardrobe option to dress up or down. It looks better in person than in the photo, for the record. Very cute professional wear.\n\nThe dress is shipped through Amazon, which makes for quick delivery. If you're on the fence about buying this dress, get off the fence and order. You'll be glad you did.\n\nI received this product at a reduced cost in exchange for a full and balanced evaluation and honest review.

This may be a downside as it likely won't last as long as the Foundry Polo which is thick and solid.\n\nAs for length, I hope this shrinks in the wash a bit. For an XLT the sleeves come almost to my elbows and the shoulders go past mine. I have a broader build so I was surprised that this polo was so wide. Overall this polo fits more like a 2XLT in my opinion. Even the length is super long. This polo reaches almost to the crotch of my pants; there is no way it is pulling out.\n\nA style note is that this is a solid polo, unlike the Foundry polos it doesn't open up at the sides on the bottom hem. This is a style choice but according to the powers that be, they require straight polos like this Joe's USA to be tucked in.\n\nSo, compared to the $15-25 Foundry Polos from JC Pennys (When they are on sale) I would say that I am not completely satisfied.

I'm not fat, but I'm definitely out of shape.\n\nI got the LT size, and washed it before wearing.  The shoulders and chest fit perfectly.  However, when they say this is a \"tall\" shirt, they're not kidding.  It looks like I'm wearing a cocktail dress.  The bottom of the shirt comes down past the crotch of my jeans -- and I don't exactly wear my pants pulled up to my eyeballs like Steve Urkel (though I do wear glasses and I like cheese, so take from that what you will).  I'm guessing someone would have to be 6'8\" or so for this shirt to look normal on them.\n\nI don't think I have a terribly short torso either.  I mostly wear IZOD polos in an LT size, and they fit great.  (Though they are 2 - 3 times the price, and not available in as many colors as Joe's USA offers, here's the link if you're curious: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I6CR778 ).\n\nObviously if you're about my height and you plan on tucking the shirt into your pants, then the extra length will be a good thing.\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, the material is thin.  A lot thinner than the IZODs I usually wear, but it also feels thinner to me than a Hanes Beefy T.  The fabric also looks more like a T-shirt.  In other words, it looks like a cheap polo.\n\nThen again, thin fabric can be an advantage if you'll be spending a lot of time outside in a hot climate.  But I'm spending most of my time in an office so it doesn't help me at all.\n\nI'm also not impressed by the stitching.  I'll admit, I've never talked about \"stitching\" before, and I wouldn't notice it at all unless it was terrible.  But just looking down right now at my chest, there are 3 thread-ends hanging off the stitching on the .. uhh .. button area.  (I'm sure there's a name for that part of the shirt, but I'm spacing on it right now.)\n\nOK, so you might say to me \"but Scott, this is so much less expensive than an IZOD -- it's a cheap shirt, so what do you expect?\"\n\nThat's very true, however due to dress code changes at work one of my buddies just bought about 10 polos that were ten bucks a piece from Kohl's.  They look better than these shirts and the material is thicker.\n\nEDIT:  I just checked with my friend, and the polos he got were Croft & Barrow brand.  At the time of this review, they're priced comparably (on sale) to these Joe's polos at kohls dot com.  Your mileage may vary as prices tend to change considerably.  But I've bought polos from Target as well that were cheap and better quality than these.  The point is that I know that there are decent quality yet inexpensive polos out there, and they're not these.\n\nAnnnnd, we have a small office with an open floor plan, so once I called attention to the shirt I was told that it \"looks weird\" and that if I \"put the belt on the outside it would make a nice dress\".  Just food for thought there.", "summary": "Too long, material is too thin, poor workmanship.", "unixReviewTime": 1437091200}

My parents bought a pair for my middle child to match with the little ones (my older kids are too old to match and too big for these PJs).  They bought the biggest size they had (7 tall) and while the top fits perfectly, the bottoms are too short for her.  I figured being a tall they'd be fine (she's 9 but still wears size 7/8 tops & some bottoms).  My other daughter's PJs are a size 6 and the bottoms for the 7 tall and the 6 are exactly the same length.  I don't know if there was an error with the PJs being packaged (there is a miniscule tag hidden in the seam of the younger girl's that says \"6\" on it but no tag in the other pair of bottoms so I can't confirm if they sent me the wrong size bottoms or assume that a 7 tall doesn't need to be longer than a size 6 bottom).  So just be forewarned that if you get the 7 tall, there's a slight possibility that the bottoms will fit in girth but be capri-length.  My daughter is ok with it but I know it was a disappointment. If they hadn't been purchased back in August through my mum's Canadian Amazon account, we might have considered returning them.  I am going to see if there's a \"contact seller\" button to let them know even though we're not returning them.", "summary": "I figured being a tall they'd be fine (she's 9 but still wears size 7/8 tops & ...", "unixReviewTime": 1451779200}

I washed these as soon as I got them, unlike other reviewers, I experience no bleeding at all whatsoever. The red did not bleed, I washed them on cold as I normally would. The material is very thin, shirt and pants, so don't expect these to be warm or like a thick cotton or anything. The waistband on the pants is not like the one in the picture, its just a regular waistband that is the same as the pants. The green is also more of a truer lime green, not as muted as in the picture. The stitching on the snowmen is great and my daughter loves it. Since the material is so thin, I can't imagine that these would last super long through wear and washing, but its perfect for the season! The pajamas shipped immediately and they arrived a day earlier than expected.

I'm not that petite.\nI am mostly disappointed in the color as it came to me different than pictured. I've included my own picture with several other articles of clothing for comparison, and I even screen captured the actual Amazon advertised photo on the far left.

I didn't want red, I wanted maroon, which is both the color name and picture advertised, so that's what I picked. If I had known it would come this way I would have picked another color entirely.\nAlso, for some weird reason the middle section of the skirt does not have any sewn in ruffles, making it look very flat which I don't like.

Over-wide fingers made my old gloves feel clunky doing things like grabbing things from pockets, using my keys, and even driving. I always felt it was easier to take a glove off, do what I need, then put the glove back on...

(once I broke in the leather after a week, of course) This makes it so I DON'T feel like taking these gloves off to do things!!\n\nOne thing to know is that they aren't that great for colder weather around freezing temperatures and below, you'll probably find yourself putting your hands in your pockets to keep them warm after a couple minutes.\n\nThey have held up very well so far after two and a half months I've had them, with nearly every day use.\n(used the gloves all winter when out and about & still using them as driving gloves)\n\nThe leather shows some wear in the fingers after this much use, but not enough to notice unless you look up close at the leather.\nI would guess that they should last me through a full year of driving, but I'll update my review if they start falling apart before then.\n\nI have and will continue to highly recommend these gloves to friends, family, and everyone else.\nBy far the best gloves I've ever used/seen for the price!

After having my ideal glove in mind, the search began. I looked high, I looked low, I looked near, I looked far. After days of searching and nearly loosing hope in finding what I wanted for a reasonable price, low and behold I stumbled upon these gloves. They were everything I wanted. Real, soft, strechy, lamb skin, cashmere lining, sized normally, good price, and classy AF. I hit this up and never looked back. They arrived promptly and i put them on with a considerable amount of gusto and grace. They fit like a glove (see what I did there?) And were so damn soft I could hardly believe what I had been missing my entire life. I've had them for several months now,  and they show no sign of wear. I don't drive without them and they are a perfect companion for a classy top coat and a scarf to give you that sophisticated classy look you always wanted.\nNote: I have slender hands/fingers so I knew they would be a wee bit loose and they are. No complaint though,  it's not a problem,  it would just be slightly snugger if they were a tad slimmer for my lady like hands.", "summary": "perfection in all its glory", "unixReviewTime": 1452038400}

Enough hip room/isn't clingy.\n\nCons:\n1. The arms are way too tight.\n\n2. The dress is way too open in the front. It is so open that I constantly have to look down to re-adjust, or the world can see my bra. This is even with a safety pin. (The photos are taken with safety pin.)\n\n3. Too short!  It is ankle length. I usually wear this with wedges, but they are just too short.\nI find that my silhouette is best elongated the high heel is covered 3/4th of the way.

It has a zippered pocket on the inside, which would fit money, credit card, iPod, maybe even a small cell phone - like iPhone without a cover. Mine hasn't shed at all. The con, and it is a big one- the horrible chemical smell. Not just the stuck in a plastic bag smell. Strong and irritating, almost like turpentine! The kind of smell that says, no screams: Made in China.  I have had it for over a week, and only after having it outside for several days and wiping it down 2-3x with a damp soapy rag has the smell gone away. I am lucky that I ordered it early enough to be able to do that. I considered shipping it back, but since I had the time, I figured I'd try. I will update after I give the present and see what the 12 yo thinks. Not everyone mentioned the smell, so maybe I was just unlucky :(", "summary": "Love the product, Hate the made in China smell", "unixReviewTime": 1424217600}

By that time they were all extremely lose. If this bag had gone through multiple trips over the course of a few years, I would chalk this up to normal wear and tear, but this is not the case. This bag arrived at my house 1 week ago today, and has been on a single trip to Florida as a carry-on. Now I have a bag with no usable straps!\n4.

The brilliant glow of the card seemed dampened by old, overstuffed wallet (from the George Costanza collection). This dingy wallet was way too large, way too bulky. I had to find something thinner, more sleek, and more worthy of holding the credentials I had worked so hard to obtain. That's when I stumbled upon the Hammer Anvil Men's Genuine Leather Slimfold. I'm sort of in awe that this wallet costs eight dollars. Sure, it looks a little cheap at first, but after it wears in, it's fine. I've examined the stitching with my jeweler's glass for flaws. I have found none. So the quality is perplexing when I consider the money I spent, but there's something even more amazing about this wallet: the design. This is, quite simply, the best-designed wallet for my needs I've ever seen. I'll break it down. This is the perfect wallet design for urban types. I am always in a city (could be San Francisco, New York, London, etc.). I must have a front-pocket wallet. This wallet has the best arrangement of pockets I've seen while maintaining its slim profile. There's a clear pocket for credentials/ID. There are three card pockets for your debit card, your bank credit card, and your AMEX Black. There's also a larger slot behind these cards where you can stash the ancillary cards you rarely use, like insurance cards, medical marijuana ID's, various underground poker room membership cards, and the like. The kicker is there's an equally large slot on the outside that's perfect for all your rail passes and hotel room keys. The bill area is large enough, but keep in mind that fewer large bills will maintain the slim profile more than many small bills. I'd pay a real wallet maker lots more money if they created a wallet with this design, but they don't, so you should just buy 20 of this one.", "summary": "The brilliant glow of the card seemed dampened by old", "unixReviewTime": 1423094400}

I love it.  For those who want to use it for keeping an emergency pill on hand, I would suggest you carefully measure the pill to make sure it will fit inside this container. The interior part of the container measures 7mm in diameter, or a little over 1/4\".  I had to remove the pill from it's foil package and wrap it in clear plastic wrap in order to protect the pill and also allow it to fit inside the container.  The depth of the hole down inside is maybe 1 inch but I just eyeballed that part of it so that's not an exact measurement of the depth.  The loop at the top seems to be sturdy, and hopefully this will last a long time.\nThe reason I do not like the typical cylinder shaped pill keepers is that they are too big to fit easily into the pocket of my snug jeans.  This one, however, fits nicely into the pocket along with my car key, and for that, I'm willing to put up with some compromise in terms of the inside dimensions of the container (it's smaller than typical pill keepers).", "summary": "I love it.

Here's everything you could want to know first IMHO: CONSTRUCTION - With baby soft medium to heavy weight jersey fabric, I like this tagless, logo-free adult-sized onesie / jumpsuit because it's comfy, stylish and fun. You will smile wearing it. Great value but the black interior is subject to some shedding (I recommend washing inside out once before wearing - especially if it is not exactly \"new\" as my first shipment clearly wasn't).  I found the kangaroo pockets in front to be barely large enough, but the zippered side pockets very nice for my phablet. SUITABILITY: I wanted it primarily for a one piece pajama / sleepwear on chilly nights but it looks so fly, I've proudly worn it to the mall and earned rave reviews. Might be too warm for some in the summer. While the long center zipper goes low enough for #1 (ladies, I don't know), I'm gonna speak to my tailor about adding a drop seat / flapjack for #2. CAVEAT: Buyer beware, as other reviewers have mentioned, I too found this item to be oddly-sized despite purchasing a size larger than my expected. At 5'9\" 175 lbs, an M had short sleeves that stopped above my wrists, an uncomfortably snug crotch, a tailored waist (my midsection is flat), and a small child-sized hood -- yet extra long legs that bunch at tight ankles. Ugh. SELLER: Pleased to report all is well in the end with kudos to the seller for exceptional personal attention to earn my satisfaction. CONCLUSION: From an M to an XL replacement, I've settled at this twice larger size in anticipation of shrinkage over time. As of now: the XL sleeve length is good (if a touch long); the legs are superduper long; the waist is better suited for a teletubbie but hopefully after a good washing and heated drying, the fit will be as close to perfect as I can ask.

These socks have extreme stretch.  To tell you how much, I wear a size 12 extra-wide shoe. They fit perfectly including around the heel (which totally surprised me)!\n\nSo why did I risk buying them when the reviews about size were all over the board?\n\n(1) I needed something to keep my toes warm at night when I'm sitting in the recliner. These cover my toes.\n\n(2) I needed something I could wear inside my Crocs. Because I haven't been able to find any socks previously, I wear my crocs in the winter without socks. (I live in Atlanta, GA so we don't really have a hard, cold winter and I can tolerate the cold fairly well.)\n\n(3) I have edema in my feet caused by a condition called \"lymphedema.\"  Because of this, I needed something that didn't hit the curve in my foot on the top. These leave plenty of room and don't cut off the circulation by cutting in my skin.\n\n(4) This condition also causes me to have swelling up my leg so wearing ankle socks is completely out of the question since they cannot go over the swelling.  (Even diabetic socks - if you are familiar with those - don't work!)\n\nRoll all this together and it's IMPOSSIBLE to find socks.\n\nWhen I put these on, I was shocked.  Even my husband couldn't believe they fit. They fit like a glove (a good glove).  The colors are just as bright and vivid as the picture shows. (I'm not afraid of color so I don't care if someone sees what the socks look like on the exposed heel since my Crocs are slide-ons.)\n\nWhile all feet are different, if you have issues with socks (like I described above), these are a good solution.  Again, when it comes to size, you'll simply need to buy them and try them!", "summary": "Finally some socks that fit my size 12 extra wide feet!", "unixReviewTime": 1473465600}

They also didn't shrink, shrivel up, or have any unraveling afterwards the washing and drying cycles! I did wash them with our regular colored clothes batch of dirty laundry, and they survived as well as didn't bleed coloring onto any of our other clothing articles in the load!!\n\nThey come very well packaged with each pair together,.

I match my socks to my pajamas when I can or my lounge clothes.  I am also a bit picky about my socks.  I don't like them feeling real thin on my feet.  I also cannot stand for the seam to be too close to the tips of my toes.  It took me my entire childhood to get used to the seams being over the knuckle area.  Without actually seeing the socks first hand, and even sometimes then I am not 100% sure, I take a risk that I may not like the seams but I give them away if that happens.\n\nThese Womens Performance No Show Foot Liners - Cushion Hidden Socks - Size 9-11 (3-pk) by ComfortNFashion come all attached to one another with a cardboard band around the center that has the ComfortNFashion name and logo along with basic information about the socks.  All three pairs are attached together by a tag through the toes.  There were no marks from me cutting the tags and removing the clamps.\n\nThese socks are a one size fits most size.  They're 80% Acrylic, 10% Polyester, 5% Nylon, and 5% Spandex.  They're made in China.  They're machine washable in warm water with like colors.  They can be tumble dried on low.  Do not bleach.\n\nThe socks fit me perfectly.  The seams are just behind the nail bed of my toes and aren't noticeable for me.  The top of the socks have a built in elastic type of material in it.  The band is about 1/4 of an inch thick.  The socks are a bit thick.  They're thicker than normal socks but not extremely thick.\n\nThese socks do have left over threads on the inside from where the colors change out.  They're not as bad on the striped socks but there's a lot on the polka dotted socks.  The stripes on the striped socks don't match up perfectly on the underside but this is hardly noticeable.  On the polka dotted pair, there were a few strings in some of the light colored polka dots.  They end up being under the foot as well so not as noticeable.\n\nThese socks don't breath as well as I need for work so they're definitely not work socks but they're great for my off days and for around the house.

I am petite, measuring about 5 foot 2 and about 120 pounds, give or take, with relatively even weight distribution--i.e. my butt isn't particularly large, nor are my gut/hips. The legs are too short for my legs (I'm obviously no giant) and the waist is too long. I don't know who the designers had in mind when they decided to include approximately a foot of fabric from where the legs end to the top of the waistband. The waist goes up to my chest, and the legs are barely long enough--I have to do quite a bit of pulling and adjusting to get the legs so the crotch is where it's supposed to be, and it always slides down so it's somewhere on my upper thigh. It's quite uncomfortable.\n\nI didn't return them because I thought the legs would stretch with a wear or two, and after that had already washed them so I didn't even try to send them back. I'm lazy. That said, I WOULD NOT recommend this product to anybody...unless they have stubby legs and the torso length of a giant.\n\nMy only positive experience with these tights is that they are very, very warm and the lining is super soft.

You won't get xxl so just ignore the option.\nAnyway, I ordered them big because as you can see from the feedbacks from other consumers, they run small.

We are a vegan family and only purchase items that are vegan. This wallet is vegan and is really nice! it is made from cork, as its name indicates. Therefore, it is very lightweight. The wallet came ready to give as a gift. It was nestled in a cardboard box on top of shredded paper. Then, the wallet itself was wrapped in a paper covering and sealed with a sticker. It had a lovely presentation. The wallet exceeded our expectations. The cork is beautifully dyed a dark reddish brown on the outside. The inside is what I think is the natural color of cork. The two tones effect is really neat. My husband was excited when I gave him the wallet to open. He does not like to have a heavy wallet, and some vegan wallets made from faux leather are very heavy. This wallet is even lighter than the hemp one he is currently using! He is excited to switch all of his cards and money to the new wallet. I would definitely recommend and buy this wallet again. The craftsmanship and presentation are excellent! Just remember to recycle the cardboard packaging.\n I was provided this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and fair review.

My husband takes it everywhere and is not super careful with it - it's still in great shape.\nThe only complaints we have is that the gold logo rubbed off fairly quick  (probably going in and out of his pocket) and at first the card slots were very stiff. It took some getting use to for him since it was so much bigger than wallets he has had before, but he still loves it.\n***\n\nMy husband and I are both vegetarians. And this wallet is a nice, classy wallet without being made of animal materials, which is seemingly hard to find.\n\nRight away I was very impressed with the quality of the materials and the craftsmanship. You could really tell that this was a nice wallet from handling it. The color of the cork and the texture all made it look quite classy.\n\nUpon first observation my husband was a little nervous about the larger size of the wallet being that it seemed bigger than he had pictured. In fact, it is quite a bit larger than the US dollar bill, as shown in my photos. I believe that it's just going to take a little time to get used to having a bigger wallet than he was previously used to.\n\nEarly on, it does feel a little bit stiff getting cards in and out of the slots (particularly the second slot as the bottom slot completely covers it). This may just need to loosen up in time.\n\nWhile It's too early to tell how well it will hold up to long term wear, we are pleased with what we have seen so far, as the craftsmanship is of such high quality. But we will come back to update if anything goes awry.\n\nBottom Line: This is a fine, classy looking larger wallet.

It does have two pockets for money so if your the type to split your bills up that would be a plus for you. I don't really mind it to much but it helps. The cork feels really nice in your hands and i have already received quiet a few compliments on the wallet. The only thing that worries me is how long the wallet is going to last with it being made of cork. And one thing that completely went over the top was the packaging. I was super impressed with how they did it. It was in a nice box and when you open it you cant see the wallet because it is wrapped in a paper type material and there is straw paper around it all. And on top of all that there was a mini card that was hand written that said Thank you. Super impressed with the service and the product. I am 100% with recommending this product to anyone for themselves or even for a gift. This would make a great gift! I received this product at a discount for an honest and unbiased review", "summary": "Super Nice", "unixReviewTime": 1457654400}

The style is drapey, and so clearly meant to run on the large side. If I were to do it again I would buy x-small. The major problem I have is with the gray shirt. First, there is a very odd, somewhat unpleasant smell to the material, even after two washings. There is no discernible smell with the blue shirt, so it must be that the material is slightly different. Additionally, the gray shirt, though the same size, is WAY larger than the blue. It is comically large--fits me the way an x-large usually would. It hangs well past my bottom. It reminds me of a maternity shirt. I have included a photo showing the size discrepancy. So, I guess it is hit or miss with these shirts. I would definitely be returning the blue shirt if I hadn't already washed it and worn it once.

The material is unbelievably soft and stretchy, and it drapes nicely.  I ordered two in XXL and loved them, even though they were a bit baggy---because comfort is far more important than style to me.  Yet they look far better and feel far more comfortable than the men's t-shirts that otherwise fill my closet.  However, there was a dearth of available colors in the XXL  so I took a risk and ordered  a couple in XL.  The XL fits me a bit better---less baggy---while still maintaining a good drape and comfort.\n\nI like the v-neck too:  It's perfect in that it's not too deep, and for a large-busted gal like me it breaks up the space between my face and my chest very well without exposing a lot of skin.  The length of the shirt is great too---not too short, not too long.\n\nI could probably stand even another inch or so on the sleeve length, but it's not too bad as is.  They are not \"cap sleeves\", which I detest because I have always had big arms, even in my younger and skinnier years.\n\nOverall I love these shirts.  They have the comfort level of pajamas, but the appearance of \"out-in-public\" clothes. I can even dress these up by pairing them with a skirt.\n\nP.S. I tried some similar tees from another brand (Texere) because they had more color selection but their fit was too snug for my taste (and I didn't like the round neck---that was when I realized shallow v-necks were the better look for me) and I sent them back.", "summary": "Awesome shirts", "unixReviewTime": 1462233600}

The fit is amazing, I am normally a size 16 or xxl depending on brand and Fisher's xxl fits me like a dream. There is a soft drape that is very flattering and I think this shirt could easily be dressed up or worn casually. I also love that the company strives for organic and sustainable products, honestly have absolutely nothing negative to say about this fine shirt. This is the second product I have recieved from Fisher's Fineries and will certainly not be my last.\nPlease not all opinions are based on my own experiences with this product.", "summary": "My new favorite clothing line", "unixReviewTime": 1459814400}

I've bought 4 so far, as they fit me just right and are SUPER soft! Lately, shirt sizes seem to be shrinking and getting all sorts of wacky, with narrowing and lengthening being an issue. I am short-waisted, narrow-waisted, with wider hips and bust and this shirt style fits me just right. Just long enough to cover the waistline of pants/skirts, but not so long that they are dragging below the crotch/butt area. I do not like my shirts to fit that way, and so many are made too long and you either have to stretch them around your hips, or bunch them up. Often, this makes your waist look thicker, too. Ugh! I also like the length of the sleeves. Long enough for a nice coverage, but not so long as to be matronly or hot. Lots of shirts these days skimp on sleeve length, making them unflattering unless you've got very toned arms. The V-neck is just the right depth and angle. Again, so many other shirts I've bought are quite low-cut (even when that's not really the intention).\n\nI wear this shirt to the gym with yoga pants and, I wear it to work with a nice skirt. I LOVE that they are made from sustainable materials (yay, healthy bamboo and organic cotton!), and I'd hope they're made in a \"fair trade\" type of factory. Although I do think they are a good value, I wish they were a bit less expensive (they are my most expensive shirts!). They wash and wear well (sometimes, I hang them to dry), but they will take longer than a polyester shirt to dry. I know this, because I hand-washed and hung-dried both on a recent trip overseas, and this took much longer to dry.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this shirt. Fishers Finery, please keep making this style, and add a few more colors, too! Royals: red, purple, or blue? Even dark teal, maybe??\n\nI rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions,.

I also have a large chest, so this shirt fit a bit awkwardly since the V-neck opening is high up and the bottom of the shirt flares out past my hips, making my shape look less feminine and defined. However, this V-neck tee has turned out to be perfect for my relaxing days or when I am out running errands.\n\nI received this ecofabric V-neck tee for the purposes of unbiased testing and reviewing. To reiterate, it is very soft and comfortable, so I would absolutely recommend it if you are looking for less clingy tees that are primarily breathable and relaxing.", "summary": "Ecofabric V-neck tee made of incredibly soft, breathable material", "unixReviewTime": 1428019200}

Well Amazon yes, yes it does-but that is the only positive part of my recent order. The order itself was two days late. Not a HUGE deal, other than this hat purchased as a river hat that was hopefully going to accompany me down a sunny section of the Colorado River yesterday. I adapted though, these things happen.. A lot it seems with Amazon these days, but they still do happen...\n\nNow for the quality of the hat which is what most people are interested in when looking at reviews... The hat fits really well. Snug, but not overly tight. I wish that I could provide more quantitative information because everyone's head size/shape is a little different, but for me it fit nicely.\n\nI have been in possession of this hat for exactly 20 minutes and upon delivery I immediately opened the box. Upon inspection, the hat had 2 tears in the top of it as you can see from the pictures. They are not HUGE tears, ~2\" but how long do you really think this hat is going to last considering that it is ALREADY torn and has not even been worn (I should have rhymed this entire review for your reading pleasure...) The package itself did not seem to be damaged, and the hat had had a plastic form inserted inside the hat for shipping that was meant to keep its shape. And it did. Therefore, I'm guessing that the damaged hat was packaged and shipped as it was.. Not good-amazon quality control, not good...\n\nI will be returning the hat today, and I have cancelled my Prime membership. There is just no value in Prime when I continually get packages late or receive products that I just need to return anyway. If this was an isolated incident, I would let it go. It's not, so I can't. I would say with regards to the hat, roll the dice. I read the reviews, I saw how many positive reviews there were, and I felt comfortable enough to order it myself. You may get lucky, or you may not. If not, Amazon is a good enough company to refund you and fix the issue. All you will be out is time, effort, and just a little bit of your soul... (ok, maybe that was dramatic, but it is still a huge pain sometimes returning crap that should have been inspected BEFORE it is shipped)!", "summary": "but for me it fit nicely.

No matter how something looks, it should be durable and practical, something that cannot be done after a several-weeks trial. I purchased this very wide-brimmed hat in 2015 and wore it all last season, and it has held up very well into this summer season (late July 2016). Although the inside of the brim is lined with a dark (in the case of my hat, \"Sonoma Stars\" red/white/blue) fabric, I feel that this adds the right amount of stiffness and durability to the item so that it does not easily flap around in the wind; it may also make it a tad warmer, as others have noted. In my view, though, the extra stability is worth it to protect the wearer from the sun. The straw weave and chin strap have held up well, and all stitching has remained intact. I purchased it initially only for use around the exterior of the house (I thought its flamboyance was not the style for this staid, elderly gent) - gardening and mowing the lawn - but this year I have dared to walk downtown wearing it and I have received lots of compliments on the hat. My days of only wearing a baseball cap with a visor in front for sun protection, are over.\n\nNote that of the hundreds of reviews left for this O'Neill hat few, if any, are left by professional reviewers in the Amazon \"Vine Program\", a program that has trashed the integrity of Amazon's review system. People who are in the business of being sent as much free merchandise as they can get their grubby hands on to write creative reviews for products they may have only looked at but not used, cannot be \"unbiased\" as they purport them to be. I don't know whether they sell their free stuff through eBay stores, save them for giving as gifts, or dispose of them at garage sales, but their mere existence has gotten me to reduce my formerly large volume of online purchases and get back into brick and mortar stores to check out quality for myself, before I buy, as I feel like a chump for being one of the few people to pay the asking price for online goods. I do applaud Amazon that they do identify which reviews are written by these people who receive free items. Sorry for this editorial paragraph, but I had to get this comment off my chest. Amazon should note that this is a Verified Purchase by me.", "summary": "Shady, cool, practical hat for the summer sun and heat", "unixReviewTime": 1469404800}

The brim is very large and got in the way a few times while I was swinging a sledge hammer.  I did sweat quite a bit and the hat absorbed a good amount of it.  We'll see how it holds up over time. The underside of the hat is all black and is basically a continuation of the black trim seen in the picture.  Although the black material may reduce the ventilation of the hat, I think the purpose is to keep the sun from breaching to your head which it does a great job doing.\n\nOverall, great purchase and will definitely purchase the exact same hat again once this hat has lived its life.", "summary": "O'neil Sonoma Hat...Recommended for working in the sun!", "unixReviewTime": 1442793600}

This review may no longer be valid if they changed more than just the emblem. My hat is closest to the \"Natural\" version they sell in 2018 based on the pictures\n\nThis sea straw holds up better than the thin stuff they use on the new style of straw hats, much stronger stuff. A month of rough use and no damage at all so far.\n\nThe underside has a glued black cotton (I think) layer to help keep tiny sun spots from shining through the straw, making this hat less distracting than my last straw hat. The inside has a thin elastic band to make it fit more comfortably, no more straw poking my forehead.\n\nThe chin cord looks frayed, like it was \"brushed\" to look old like they do with \"fashionable\" jeans these days. It's softer than most cords because of this (less itchy on chin), but I'm concerned it might have reduced the cord's lifespan.\n\nThe brim is so wide that it reduces head range of motion if you're wearing something bulky on/around your back/shoulders (backpack, lifevest, seat/chair, costume) but is very light and comfortable otherwise. Good for yard work and beach, not good for kayak fishing.\n\nThe emblem on the front is ugly and prevents air from moving through the front of the hat, but you can cut the stitching on the back, and the glue they used is so soft you can gently pull it off from there without hurting the straw, no heatgun required.\n\nOne Year Edit: I still use this hat one year later, I've found it expands too much when it gets soaked so don't use it in the rain it will expand enough that it no longer rests on your head but on your ears, and is heavy when soaked with water. Leaving it to dry it shrank back to the original  size though.\n\nThe steel eyelets for the chinstrap are not stainless or coated, they rusted in the presence of salt water (ocean use). If you take this hat to the beach I suggest you rinse the eyelets to keep them from rusting too much. The chinstrap stopper has a steel spring that has rusted too, but it still works so far.\n\nOtherwise, this hat has held up well enough for a straw hat, imo. The only damage is on the very top, and I blame myself for smacking it on things, because I'm used to being short enough to go under, and the hat increases my height several inches.", "summary": "Good durable straw hat.", "unixReviewTime": 1441497600}

Some aspects are great, others are very lacking. Let's start with my head size, I wear a 7 3/8 - 7 1/2 fitted caps (bigger noggin, but not enormous). In regards to the hat, the black fabric under the rim really helps reduce glare (I used the hat at beaches and many pool decks and can attest to this) but, it only comes in one size and that one size is a bit too small for my head. I realize my large dome is my problem and this hats fits most people well or even a bit too big. But, the rim of the hat sits funny, got oddly molded in the box it was shipped it (which was too small for the hat) and it's never really recovered to normal. The bill has always had this weird ridge in it right where it meets the top part of the hat, and it sits unevenly. I've been battling with the bill of this hat since day one to try and get it to sit normal in a nice disc shape. But, the strap is nice, the padding on the inside of the hat that goes around your dome to prevent scratchy straw on your skin is also a nice touch. If you have a big dome or like your straw hats to sit nicely and not warp and get bent out of shape, you may want to try buying a handmade hat from someone at a local farmers market....at least that's what I had to do.\n\nUPDATE: After about 2 years this hat started to break down considerably, should be noted that it did get worn about 1-4x a month and bumped around occasionally in the house with the hats, but nothing abnormal. It's a straw hat so some of the breakdown was expected and none of the holes prevented it from being used properly (unless you have a bald head in which case it could cause a weird sunburn...luckily my hair is long). But, the woven hat material became very fragile after a year or so and started easily breaking off from touching almost anything after about 2 years.\nGood luck!", "summary": "Decent hat, a few issues", "unixReviewTime": 1424995200}

I have the misfortune of being pale skinned and I also walk to and from work, so I needed more than just the shade around the eyes for an hour. This hat works perfectly. The inside is lined with black fabric, so the glare from the reflective material used in the crosswalk is hindered quite a bit. The fabric also keeps the sun from coming through, unlike other straw and fabric hats. In addition, this hat is very stiff, keeping my field of vision open so that I can see all around me. The cord does a fine job in high wind conditions, and the bead in the cord is spring loaded, so it does not slide down after wearing for a while, but stays put. The upper crown of the hat is not lined, but their is a band just the inside of the crown for sweat absorption. Not having fabric in the top of the hat is helpful for keeping the head cool.  I was initially hesitant to purchase this hat, as my head is large for a woman, and I was afraid the brim would only cover a small portion of my face like other hats have. This is not the case. The brim is 5.5 inches wide, and covers my face, neck, and some of my shoulder when directly under the sun. The depth of the crown is about 6 inches deep, 6 1/2 inches wide at the base, and 8 inches long (since the crown is not rounded, but oblong). I am not sure of my hat size, but the circumference of my head is about 22 inches, and the fit is not quite snug. I do, however, wear my waist length hair in a bun on the top of my head when I work, and the bottom of the crown comes to rest just above my brow. This makes the hat snug for me. Overall, the hat seems pretty durable: the straw is very stiff, and high wind, heat, and moisture have not caused it to bend at all. I believe the fabric lining also keeps it sturdy. I should caution, this is not a hat for fashion, but a reliable utility hat. If it breaks down, I would purchase the same one again, but I don't see that happening in the near future.

It is very stretchy and fits a range of sizes very well.\nBut if you're looking for something that looks a bit more professional and is easier to manage, I would suggest looking elsewhere. To start off with, the fin looks cheaply made. The seams aren't very securely stitched, and are even sometimes sewn backwards (!) so around the seam you have the  remaining fabric frayed out all around the edges. Secondly, putting it on is very difficult. Both sides of the flipper are cut exactly the same, so there is no place for your ankles to bend, and that aside, at the start of the opening for the flipper it seems to be sewn for only one foot, or just the toes for both. Good luck trying to get your feet comfortably into it. Also, though it would fit perfectly someone with a wider frame,  If you have long legs I would turn around now while you still can. Though I don't have a very large butt, I have long grasshopper-like legs. No matter how I tried to stretch it, it only wanted to come up to the middle of where I wanted it to cover. (This is with the largest size) There was still plenty of room for my thighs, but it did not want to stretch to fit over my butt.\nMy suggestion: if you want a cheap mermaid fin and you have short legs and a good size fanny, as well as a willing family member to carry you to wherever you need to be, go ahead and get it. But if you want something that looks professional, that fits comfortably, and that you can use for more than one use, buckle down and fork over the money for a more expensive--but better made--one elsewhere.", "summary": "it's great.

The cross is a depiction of two nails arranged to form the cross and is a very powerful visual. The rawhide cord is adjustable, making it easy to pair it with any other necklace or chain. I have gotten more reaction and compliments on this piece because of its understated simplicity.

It is a tad too high under the bust line, and the part that points up in the middle is too high and really digs into me.\nMy only other disappointment,, and this isn't really the garments fault, is the spillage I am having on the top of my back. I am going to need to play around with some bra's and see if one with a wider band can help control that.\nIf it wasn't for the fact the the corset is too long, I found it comfortable, liked the back support I got from it, and had no issues breathing.  Hopefully once I get the correct length, the \"girls\" won't pour out as bad...I like them supported, but at 50 years old, I don't need them at my chin! lol (it only looks bad with my arms down)\nShipping was fast, and hopefully the return will be painless.

I have only had it for a few weeks and haven't worn it for a long period of time, but I expect it should work well for tight lacing and waist reduction.\n\nI am 5'5\", about 128lbs. My underbust measures 29\", waist 27\" (measured snug, not too tight), hips 36\". Originally I ordered the size medium, which did fit nicely, but I was able to lace it closed completely on the first try. This might be fine for some people, but this is not going to reduce your waist size over time (which I would like). I exchanged for the small, and the small is perfect for me. When lace tight I have about a 2\" gap all the way down the center back. As I continue to wear it I am hoping to have my waist reduce a bit, and the corset should eventually close at the waist at center back.\n\nThe quality for the price is petty incredible. I have never seen anything this sturdy at this price!!! The busk is steel and reinforced with steel stays on each side. The center back has 2 steel stays on each side of the grommets as well. This seems like it will hold up to a lot of wear without bending over time (I have had this problem with other cheep corsets!).The rest of the corset has steel spiral boning throughout, which will help it hold its shape but flex to your curves. It feels like the small pieces of boning that reinforce the grommets at the hips are plastic, but that is fine in my opinion - its such a small piece it shouldn't warp over time. The overall feel is amazingly sturdy. I have such great posture when I have it on! I love the length of the corset - it certainly eliminates any muffin top or bulging you might have on your belly/hips.\n\nA cute surprise is the lining - it is white and grey leopard print! (On the medium it has a little blue in it too). I think it's a nice detail to have. It's fun, and you can't see it at all once the corset is on and laced. The lacing up the center back is nice and long and sturdy. The lacing on the hips is just regular poly satin ribbon. I might want to replace that at some point to a stronger lace but for now its fine.\n\nOverall, amazing buy for a beginner corset! It's a great way to get a feel if you like wearing corsets without investing a ton of money. I'm so glad I made this purchase :)", "summary": "I LOVE this corset", "unixReviewTime": 1436486400}

I have amazon prime so it came very quickly. Ok, first things first, all of you ladies that left bad reviews need to understand more about corsets! To effectively train your waist your corset needs to be 2-6\" smaller than your actual waistline! Therefore, the corset will be smaller and tighter than your waist and is NOT supposed to completely close in the back when you first get it. You have to \"train\" your waist to get it that size, which is the whole point! Once you are able to wear your corset completely laced shut it's time to get the next size down and start the process again, unless you are happy with that size and don't wish to go any smaller. Another thing I must address to all the ladies having trouble with their corset breaking, when you first buy a corset you MUST \"season\" it! Basically, gently break it in. You can't just pop it out of the box and force it as tight as it will go or you will warp the steel boning and strain the fabric! As you season your corset it will mold to your body and will be more comfortable to wear and will last you much longer. If you are unfamiliar with how to season a corset look it up on Google! All that being said, I think this corset is a good starter corset to try waist training to see if you like it. The boning in it is steel, I tested it with a really strong ceramic magnet...a refrigerator magnet might not be strong enough to get through all the layers of fabric. The boning is pretty flexible but that is to be expected at this price range. To get a corset with really thick bones you'd probably have to spend upwards of $200 or more. I bought this one because I recently had a baby and didn't want to invest in a really good corset until my weight stabilizes more. The best corsets you can buy are the custom made ones, but if you've never done waist training before I'd recommend buying one like this first to see if you like it because custom ones are very expensive. Overall I think this corset is fantastic for only being around $45! My only complaint is I wish they would use the same kind of ties on the sides that they use in the back of the corset...the side ties are done with cheap ribbon, but that's no big deal because I can easily replace those.\nSo ladies, BEFORE buying any corset DO YOUR RESEARCH!\n5/29/2015 UPDATE REVIEW!\nOk so now that I've been breaking this corset in and was able to examine it more closely, I wanted to give you guys an update now that I'm more familiar with it. I compared it to my mid-range one which was around $100 and here are my findings!\nThis corset does have an attached modesty panel measuring aprox 5\" long, the item description says it has a 100% cotton lining but the tag says it is 90% polyester,  5% cotton, and 5% elastin. (A waist training corset should NOT have elastin in it as this gives some stretch to the fabric.) This corset has a 1/2\" busk that is 12\" in length with a 3/8\" flat bone sewn next to it for added strength. Personally I  prefer the 1\" busks as they provide more support, but they did it this way because it's cheaper. They claim this corset has 26 spiral steel bones but this is incorrect. It actually has 16 spiral steel bones and 4 PLASTIC short bones that are placed along side the ties. It also includes a total of 6 flat steel bones, giving this corset a grand total of 22 actual STEEL BONES. The four short plastic bones are 5\" long and I know they are plastic because I tested every single bone with a strong ceramic magnet. The description said there is a waist tape but I have yet to find it, I know some are sewn between fabrics to make them less visible but you can still see them if you look at the inside at an angle. I'm not saying there definitely isn't one, I'm  just saying I can't find it at all.\nAfter wearing this corset for a couple days to break it in I did notice that some of the material is pulling away from the grommets, nothing major though. It is getting more comfortable to wear as I break it in.  Since this material has a very slight stretch to it I may end up using it as my sleeping corset since your body expands when you sleep this could be ideal for that.\nMy more expensive corset has 3/8\" spiral steel bones, 1/2\" flat steel bones, and 1\" steel busk. This corset has 3/8\" spiral steel bones, 3/8\" flat steel bones and 1/2\" steel busk. Just to give you an idea of what spending an extra $50 gets you, and so you are now aware that just because something is listed as having more bones doesn't necessarily mean it's better. The more expensive one had thicker tougher bones which will give you better shaping even though it has less bones than this cheaper one. I'd rather pay $100 for 24 strong steel bones then $45 for 26 thin steel and plastic bones. Anyway, amazon carries a great line of corsets from \"What Katie Did\", but they will cost you over $200, another great place to get a quality corset is Isabella's corset, they are cheaper than what katie did but still make a nice strong corset for under $200. And no, I'm not affiliated with either of them, just trying to be helpful because I know how hard it is to find a reputable corset shop!\nI hope I covered everything and helped you with your decision! I will post a picture soon as soon as I finish seasoning it! Happy corset hunting! ;)\nPs: for reference I'm 5'7 about 156 lbs. And my waist measure came to 31 1/2\" , I  ordered the size large and am able to lace it close enough for the modesty panel to reach the other side. I could have ordered the next size up but since I'm losing weight I didn't want to have to order a new one in a month or two.", "summary": "great for the price range!", "unixReviewTime": 1432598400}

I bought this corset as a surprise for my wife. Immediately she liked the design. It fit her very nicely and she was comfortable in it, Fortunately she has curves in all the right places for a corset. I was able to get the lacing just right to give her a snug fit and have it look great.\n\n My wife owns many different types of corsets, one of which is handmade and cost in the hundreds. She's been wearing corsets off and on for close to 10 years. That being said I'm fairly confident in saying that this corset is more of a costume piece then a shapewear peace. If your intention is to do any kind of body shaping this is not the piece for you. If you want something sexy and fun to wear as a corset, either on top of clothes or not, this corset is can be lot of fun. The materials used in making this corset are very basic. The outer shell is a stretchy imprinted vinyl that is lined on the inside. It provides some shape and support but it is definitely not the type of boning you would see in a corset designed for body shaping; boning in those types of corsets are made out of metal and are far more frigid. You would probably find similar corsets in the mall, maybe at a Spencers. No one will ever confuse this corset with a high priced one when they see you in it. But they will say it is cute, sexy and fun.\n\nGreat for steampunk, gothic, or even Halloween events. Not bad for bedroom use either if you're into that kind of thing...", "summary": "You get what you pay for", "unixReviewTime": 1450310400}
