I'm an inch below six feet and the dress reaches just above the ankle, give or take. My rule as far as sizing is to go one size up (I bought the XL), depending on how loose you prefer. And it is a loose fit, so don't expect body skimming. The material is light and flowy enough for spring/summer with sandals, but paired with a cardigan and boots would be perfect for fall/winter.

I like so many things about the dress! Starting with the linen material and design that provides a light weight, comfortable Summer dress that keeps you cool on even the hottest Summer days! I love how the design is cut,it not only fits but compliments my figure with out making me feel self conscience. I am chest heavy and am self conscience alot,but in this dress I feel very comfortable and self confident for a change! After viewing the size chart for the dress, I ordered a size 14USA,when I typically wear a size 8/10USA and it fit comfortable and loose flowing,which i like in dresses designed like this one and other linen dresses. You could order down if you wanted a clingier fit to it if you prefer that style/fit. I'm looking forward to adding this piece to my summer wardrobe and have a feeling it will end up oneof my favorite summer dresses! Also,although I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my review, I do all of my reviews in an open and honest manner, because I believe that everyone should receive a great product at a great price when shopping online.

I really thought it was going to be more of a heavier type burlap/gauze feel to it but, I couldn't have been more wrong. It's a beautiful material that has more of a silk/gauze scarf like feel to it..it's so vibrant and I love the simple cut of it. Looking at it hanging here I like how the top orange part has the slit up the side and then the ends taper to a point...honestly it fit me great too. The only thing that I can even dis on it about is that it is a super wrinkled material. I plan to take the steam iron to it but, I have been a bit under the weather. At any rate my measurements are 36C-29-36. I purchased the large and like I said this dress fit me perfect. The other thing I love about it is that you just pull it over your head no buttons or zippers to mess with. Oh and it also matches some of the beautiful scarfs I own. I did receive this dress as a sample in exchange for my thoughts on it. Peace! ~Kiki", "summary": "SIMPLICITY WITH COMFORT ALWAYS A GREAT TYPE OF DRESS TO OWN..", "unixReviewTime": 1468627200}

I do not necessarily need help in this area but if you are looking to make your chest look larger this is the perfect top for you.\n\nI ordered mine in large and it fits perfectly. I am five foot three inches tall, weigh 145 pounds and have a 38DD chest.\n\nWhile I love wearing it as a tunic top it also looks great tucked in as well.\n\nIt is comfortable, light enough weight for summer weather, and flows. In fact there is enough room in the tummy area to wear while pregnant! If you are not preggers but looking to cover some added belly weight this is a great tunic for you.\n\nI love the sleeves - they are just long enough to cover my bigger upper arms which I like to hide when possible.\n\nI think the style is really interesting with a seam on the upper chest and draping coming down from the seam onto the bust area. Creating a nice elongating effect due to that and the V neck.\n\nThe draping goes all the way down the shirt to the bottom.\n\nI found all seams to be well finished, no loose threads, and very nice fabric used that has a decent amount of stretch to it.\n\nI received the DJT Womens V Neck Short Sleeve Pleats Blouse Tunic Top free or discounted for my review. If I have any issues with this item in the future I will update my review to reflect that.\n\nI am really enjoying the DJT women's fashion line here on Amazon - they always have unique designs with interesting features like this top has.\n\nI hope you found my review helpful and thank you for reading.", "summary": "A very comfortable and stylish women's tunic top.

To us and other customers 3 star means overall it's a bad product. Considering the low price we are charging, and it's great quality as a waist trimmer with four bones and two velcro straps. I personally think it deserves a 4 star rating. If you agree with me here could you possibly take several minutes to change the rating to 4 star?

Greedy and just tacky!\nMy original review:\n\nIf you're looking for medical back support this might not be the item for you.

I am very happy with the color choices for this top. I purchased the blue green color and absolutely love the color of it. It is bright and goes with anything. I really like that it does not have a straight hem line at the bottom rather ends at a point in the front and back. This does a great job of hiding my mommy tummy, and looks nice and flowy. The material that this is made of is very soft and lightweight. I like that it has some spandex in it because it comfortably accentuates my feminine curves.

Many tunics I have tried either look like they should be a maternity top or they look almost like a dress. This top is slenderizing, does not look like a tent, and is flattering even on me. haha\nI love the way it lays. It sort of drapes over the hip area, and the asymmetrical design is slimming. The waist goes in just enough, and the neckline is perfect. I recently bought a top similar to this, but the neckline was too high, and it makes someone like me with a larger chest look even larger. This one is just right. The sleeves also are just right. Some short sleeves are almost like capped sleeves, so if you want something a bit longer, these sleeves are a good length.\nI chose the purple/gray, and my husband complimented me on both the color combination and design.\nI also like the fabric. It falls and lays nicely without being too clingy. I was afraid it would be too thin. It is thin, but not too much so. A tank top could be worn underneath, but I don't think it is necessary.\nThis top looks great with a pair of skinny jeans or leggings and some sandals or boots. I think this shirt sort of gives me effortless style, because it doesn't look like I've tried to hard, but I feel fashionable.\nIf you are looking for a tunic that doesn't look frumpy and is flattering, I think this one is great.\nI paid full price for this item.

I bought the XXL and I'm a G cup. I personally feel more supported by a sports bra that is a tighter and I've found personally that sports bras that are meant for a larger D cup (band size of 40 or larger) are the perfect fit for me. In the product description it says the XXL will fit a regular bra size of a 40D so that is the size I bought.\n\nThis sports bra is way too small. The XXL is definitely not constructed for a 40 band size or even a D cup for that matter. I was able to get it on and make myself comfortably situated into it but the band under my breast was very constricting. I feel the band was more for someone who wore a large rather than an XXL. The band didn't have much stretch to it however the bra itself does stretch in the bust and the material is very soft. The bra had white cups/pads inside and I didn't like the cups/pads so I took them out. They were awkward because they were way too small for the bra (I noticed this before I even put the bra on). I do like that the cups/pads are removable.\n\nI rated this 3 stars because of the band issue. The XXL is not big enough for someone who wears a 40 band size in regular bra. Because I knew off the bat this sports bra would be snug on me I feel it's unfair to rate it any lower.\n\nIf you are busty like me and like a tighter fitting sports bra, I wouldn't recommend buying this. But if you are an average cup and band size then this sports bra would be perfect. I just suggest sizing up since it does run small.\n\nI received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

I ordered the Multicolor7, Multicolor5, and Purple colored pairs. They're so beautiful and the designs are so sharp and well-defined. (See photos.) The high quality material of the pants themselves is very soft and lightweight. I can easily use these even on hotter days. I'm 5'2, 34B-26-36, and weigh about 125 pounds. I ordered size smalls and they all fit very well. They don't feel tight or uncomfortable at all. Because I'm on the short side, the rise is higher on me, coming up to my waist and covering my belly button. The bottom of the pants also reach down to about mid-shin. They were delivered almost two (2) weeks earlier than estimated. That's always a great plus! I tried them on and immediately ordered three more pairs. The second set that I ordered (Blue2, Dark Green, and Purple2) also came in two (2) weeks early! The amazing low price on these tights definitely makes ordering more pairs an easy decision to make. These are great for exercise, outdoor activities, and even just lazing around. I also plan on ordering more to give out as gifts. I would recommend these to anyone looking for affordable, cute, stylish, and lightweight capris.\n\nFYI: I ordered this product on my own accord.

The material feels very nice; it is sleek and soft. The pattern is vibrant and eye appealing. The tie on the front of the top is a nice feature and is an added plus for both style and fit so you could adjust it to the way it 'holds' you. The over shoulder straps are also adjustable.\nThe cons: The top is WAY to big. I usually wear a 38C bra size (but I always get a 38 D swimsuit top - otherwise I do not get the coverage), but this was h.u.g.e. -two of me could fit into this top. The underwire comes up a little bit to high in the middle, and i could tell that  it would be a problem area, had it fit. The bottoms fit as far as getting them on, but are too snug and would be in the uncomfortable zone. The bottoms also show all of my fluffy belly muffin areas, both above and below but especially on the sides (I am normally a 12/14). It is too bad because I really do like the suit, but i think the sizing is way off.  There is just no way I could get away with wearing either the top or the bottom even as separates, or I would have kept it because well, it is that pretty. If you could order this in the top and bottom separately I believe it would help with the sizing issue. If you are extra extra large on the top, have no fluff, and small on the bottom then this might fit, but  unfortunately I am not so I had to return the suit.\nI did NOT receive this item at a discount for my feedback - and I did NOT receive this item for free for my feedback.

I'll update you in a few weeks as I wear this more often to see how it seems it will last.\n\nBut since the second I've put this on I've decided I love it and I'm going to buy every color as soon as I have some free income.\n\nThis is so mother-freaking comfortable.\n\nLets get some context. I am comfortably a size 20-22. I ordered the XXL in faith that it MIGHT fit me. It fits perfectly, maybe even a little loose (As I wear it and it will stretch with time.) If you want a fitted look, get your normal size. If you want a tight-tight look I think you can comfortably order a size down, the stretch on this is powerful.\n\nNow, as I am a size 22, I got this NOT intending to wear it in public, but just to wear around the house this summer or as PJs. I'm completely confident now in both of those applications. Again, this is so comfortable. I'm having no bunching in the crotch (which is ALWAYS a problem with me in rompers.) And although the short area does ride up some, it's not nearly as bad as other fabrics (like pure rayon or chiffon). The torso section of this isn't impossibly short (as I always feel like rompers are).\n\nBasically, this thing is the greatest thing to lounge around the house in. If you're someone who is fit or has a flat stomach, this is going to look hot on you as well. Id say you could pair it with a kimono or something and wear it out comfortably. Ive been running around the house in it and wrestling with my husband and I haven't had a cheek fall out yet.\n\nAnyway, I purchased this item at a slight discount in exchange for an unbiased trial and honest review, but as I've said, I'm going to buy all of the other colors anyway, this is a great and affordable modern staple-- in my opinion", "summary": "SO COMFORTABLE", "unixReviewTime": 1463875200}

I have a small head and my husband has med sized head. It fit us both with room to spare for larger heads. It did not cut the wind very much, which was upsetting. I would have preferred to have polar fleece. It did cut the dust of mowing the property. The opening for the eyes was great. I could wear my glasses or sunglasses without a problem. I did not wear it over the nose much because it gets wet from breathing. It does not wick the moisture away as it should for this type of product. Using it mainly as a neck warmer now. This is not comfortable under a motorcycle helmet because of the gathering of material on the top. The smooth head would be better for this.

I normally wear an extra small-medium, depending on the style, in tops and size 5 jeans. The waist of the bottoms looks really small, but they stretch and still feel comfortable. The only thing I'd be concerned about is the top for larger breasted women. However, since you can adjust it with the string, I feel like it'd still look great on a larger chest, just maybe more revealing. The only thing to watch out for is the string. You have to lace the top yourself, it's easy, but since the ends of the string aren't tied in knots you want to make sure not to ravel it anymore. This could easily be replaced with another string though. To me, this outfit is definitely worth the price. The print is gorgeous, it fits well, and it's incredibly economic in terms of price.

Soft and silky to the touch as a dance costume would be. The fit is perfect on me! I'm 5'3\" 125-130# and they fit great. A touch on the long side but I'm a shortie! They go all the way down to my socks. Very comfy and very VERY stretchy. They are two layered, the inner layer being white so when you bend or stretch, the white inner layer shows through. They are NOT see through. Although they appear to be due to the inner layer being white. I'm not a fan of the white showing through, giving the illusion of being see through..I don't think that's worth knocking off a star for though. I honestly give these a 4.5 stars but I like to always round up! think I might buy another pair but maybe white this time. That way both layers match each other.\nI was unable to upload pictures on this review but you can see them here: https://www.amazon.com/review/RRALER0ZR495S/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01DHRHWHG\n\nI received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review", "summary": "cute pants", "unixReviewTime": 1464998400}

I love the cheery fabric and vintage styling.  The boy shorts are\nso nice.  I can't wait for summer to get here so I can fully enjoy it.\n\nThe fabric for this suit is a nice thick spandex.  Since it is thick you won't have any issues with seeing\nthrough it when wet.  This fabric will hold up in cholorine pools or salt water with ease and still look\ngreat with proper care.  Rinse or wash in a woolite type product on gentle cycle after each use. The\nwoolite will protect the elasticity of the fabric and keep the color from fading.\n\nThe styling of this suit is adorable.  This suit features a halter style neckline that ties behind the\nneck.  There are padded under wire cups.  There are removable push up pads included in the package.\nA tie at the center of the bust for decoration.  The bodice of the top is a line and falls away from the\nbody in vintage halter style.\n\nThe bottoms are boy shorts.  I really like boy shorts.  I love that the full coverage they provide.\nFor me, I found the bottoms to be a bit snug.  However, it may just be because I am bigger on\nthe bottom half of my body.  I am a bit pear shaped.  If you have a smaller bootie and thin thighs\nyou will not have an issue.  If you are like me, just go up one size.\n\nOverall, I like this suit.  It is supper cute.  You could even wear this top with a pair of shorts or\ncapris for street wear.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/TXZTrade-Women-s-Floral-Tankini-Swimdress-Cover-Up-Vintage-One-Piece-Swimsuit-with-Swimming-trunks-TXZ9019-Blue-XL/dp/B01F8PA5LA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">TXZTrade Women's Floral Tankini Swimdress Cover Up Vintage One-Piece Swimsuit with Swimming trunks TXZ9019-Blue-XL</a>\n\nSample received for a fair and unbiased evaluation of quality and functionality.

I ordered an XL and I am normally a M/L depending on the maker.\n  2.  It comes with a bad smell and you need to wash it right away so it doesn't stink up your other clothes. It is fine after 1 washing.\n  3.  The elastic at the base of the sleeves is very tight.  It's wearable as long as you don't push the sleeves up.

I really like the design because I have been getting away from 2 pieces and don't really like one-pieces. This style kind of works as both. One thing to be aware of is there is a significant amount of padding and i didn't check to see if you could take them out. I usually hate really thick padding but because of the style of the suit, it isn't as obvious with this one.  I received this either free or at a discount in exchange for an honest review.

I really like the look of this swim suit because I don't feel like showing off all my curves. I like that it has the bikini look with a built in shirt fr extra coverage from the sun and from people's judging eyes. The swim suit came on time. It came in a plastic bag that had no rips in it. I tried it on the bottoms fit just fine, a little tip the sides come untied rather easily so you may want to check them and retie them if needed. The top fit just fine to until we got to the straps. They were to long. I tightened them as much as I could and then where still to long. I even tried see pin the straps in the back to see if that would help shorten them some more but it didn't help all that much. The straps were still to long. I didn't see any other option then to return the suit sadly. I don't see away for it be fixed unless the sew the straps shorter. Other then the straps the rest of the suit fit just fine.

I would love to wear a bikini, but I'm just not comfortable enough with my post-baby belly to pull it off. This swimsuit is a great compromise! The tank is attached to the bra, but is baggy, so it hides the belly flab perfectly!!!\nThe only problem with this suit (which is why I deducted a star) is that the sizing is very strange. I normally range between a medium and large size, but after reading some reviews that stated it ran small in size I decided to order a large. After wearing it, I really wish I could have a medium top and XL bottoms. I'm short (5'1\") and have a short torso...the top has adjustable straps, but even with them as short as they would go, it was still too big. I folded the straps and sewed them to make it fit. I probably had to take up almost an inch of the straps in order for it to fit me properly. But luckily I was able to do it and you can barely even tell, so it still looks good. The other downside with the top is that the bra is narrow from top to bottom, so it feels like it doesn't cover the bottom of your breasts. I'm small-chested so it's not much of a problem for me, but my large-chested friend bought this same suit, but she makes it work. The tank that covers the bra hides everything you need it to lol. Now on to the bottoms...they are short from top to bottom also. The top of my butt crack shows ! My friend has the same problem. The reason this is not a big deal to me is that the tank top has a stretchy band at the bottom and is long enough that it covers the top of the bikini bottoms. The stretchy band is tight enough to keep the tank top in place and therefore cover any crack that may be showing .\nWith just a few size adjustments this would definitely be a five star swimsuit. I still love it and it makes me feel more confident at the pool without sacrificing any style!\n\nDisclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "A cute way to hide your post-baby belly!", "unixReviewTime": 1468627200}

I thought this sun hat would go great with my sundresses and swimsuits I plan on taking with me on this trip. Even though, I have had bad experiences with items being shipped then lost through the China Post, this hat actually did not take that long to arrive by mail. There were four color choices for this hat but, I chose the off white/light tan color. I felt the neutral color choice would be better suited for my variety of summer clothing wear for this upcoming vacation trip. The hat does look exactly like the photo attached to this product description. The hat according to the item description is a material of papyrus and fabric. However, there is no manufacture product tag on the inside of the hat to know for absolute sure what it is made of or where it was made. If you have ever shopped or bought any kind of hat in the United States, there is always a manufacture tag on the inside attached. The stitching looks decent on this hat but, I did have to cut off several loose strings around it with a pair of scissors. The hat seemed a bit to loose for my head in wearing it but, it could be due to me being a small petite lady too. The picture shows like to wear the hat with the bow on the side but, the hat seemed to look right on my head with wearing the bow towards the back of my head.\n\nI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are strictly my own and have not been influenced in any manner. Your opinion may vary from that of my own. Thank you.\n\n Size(approx):Brim:4.7\";High:3.9\";Circumference:22.0\"", "summary": "Hat Price You Get What You Pay For", "unixReviewTime": 1464480000}

The color is a pretty ombre tie-dyed and would look really nice with jeans for a casual look or wear with leggings and add a thin belt around the waist or a long chain necklace to dress it up a bit. It is more fitted so it has a classy look.\nI would have given 5 stars because I really do like the shirt, but the description says this shirt is rayon and spandex, but in fact, the label says it is polyester and cotton. Not a huge deal to some people, but I would have preferred the fabric to be as described.\nBottom line, I like the look and feel of this shirt and am glad I ordered.\nI was given a discount on this purchase for an honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Buy it!

I like how they spelled out mom is a curvy cursive type writing. I has a nice flow. The little Cubic Zirconia accents are in Blue and Pink. I think this is a very pretty design that any mother would love to wear.\n\nThe best way to put this on is to slide it from the side onto your wrist. Don't pull on the ends to widen this too many times. That eventually makes the metal weak and it might just break. So my advice is to open it just enough so you can slide it on and then leave it there. This cuff is not too thick or heavy. It is not super thin or cheap either. I would say it is in the middle somewhere at medium/thin. It feels light on my wrist and comfortable.\n\nThe inner band is stamped with the S925 for Sterling Silver. The metal is well polished and it shines. The band has a thicker rim around the edges than toward the center. That gives this cuff some added sturdiness. It looks well made and very pretty.\n\n*****DISCLOSURE: I received this item free of charge to evaluate and review.

The navy color is close to black. The workmanship is not the best since I found some loose threads. The shirt I received looks like a typical mass-produced product with not much attention to quality but style. The concerns other buyers expressed about the size is valid. You have to order a size up. Also the Emiqude shirt is a slim fit so be guided accordingly. I am 200-lbs, 6-ft. I normally wear L or XL. However, this manufacturer uses Chinese sizing, so I ordered XXL which fitted me perfectly.\n\nFor the quality of this Emiqude shirt, the regular price of $27 is expensive. $15 would be more like it.\n\n*** Disclaimer: I purchased the Emiqude Mens Casual Slim Fit Long Sleeve Pocket Contrast Dress Shirt at a discount price $13.49 in exchange for my fair, unbiased and honest opinion.

Before I go on, I must say I really love, still love the way this bag \"looks\". Where else can one find such cute-looking bag? I got a lot of compliments, too. The reason I need to stop using this bag and need to give this bag only one stars is because this bag has no protecting at all and is designed very very poorly for your back and your shoulders. Because of my job, I need to carry a lot of things in my bag; laptop (Macbook Air - 2.96 lbs, notebooks, pencils and supplies, etc. I was using this bag for almost three months and I've been suffering from lower back pain for almost two months, and now I have mild sciatica that needs yoga everyday and physical therapy. At first I didn't know it's because of this bag, then I realized it's because this bag is designed so poorly, has no protection whatsoever for my back, so my laptop was hitting my lower back everyday when I walk with this bag. Well, obviously if you don't need to carry a lot of things like me, this bag is probably for you and you most likely won't develop sciatica like me, but my suggestion for anyone looking at this bag is: Focus on if a bag will make you comfortable instead of making you look cute. That's a lesson I learnt in a hard way.\nP.S. If you worry about your back and shoulder, I suggest looking into a backpack from North Face or Nike or hiking backpacks with paddings and with waist strap. They are much more comfortable than this bag.", "summary": "Warning: Stay away! I got horrible back pain and mild sciatica from using this bag!!", "unixReviewTime": 1496534400}

I usually shop at express for my clothes, as I'm a very skinny guy and most clothes seemed baggy. The promise of a cheaper alternative to Express was very alluring, and drove me to want to try this product out.\n\nI usually wear t-shirt size medium, but prefer a small button up to compensate for bagginess with a product that should be more fitted. Express extra slim (14/14.5) usually is my favorite cut of shirt without a tailor. However, I purchased a medium of this shirt based on review advice and sizing.\n\nIt fits well in length and neck, but it is a little baggier in the chest for my preference. I'm 170lbs, 6'2\", so very thin. I think an \"average\" build individual would find this to be a slim fit, but it's sightly baggier than then my preference.\n\nThe quality seems to be pretty good. There's a few exposed threads that could be cleaned up, but nothing too bad. The material is thin, but that's expected, for the price and also just for the style of shirt. I'm sightly disappointed it doesn't have room for collar stays, but that's a minor issue.\n\nFor the price, you could easily pay 3x as much for a similar quality dress shirt!", "summary": "For the Price- Worth it!", "unixReviewTime": 1464220800}

This tunic arrived this week and I couldn't be happier!  It is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!  This is a great summer tunic that you can dress up or dress down.  I was so IMPRESSED with this tunic that I don't even know where or how to start!\n\nThis Ladies Tunic Top by Laksmi is black with a white flower design.  The flower design is not one of those iron-on decals but actually imprinted into the blouse.  This design will last!  The top is well crafted of 95% Polyester and 5% Spandex, which gives this tunic top a bit of a stretch.  You will need to keep in mind that this is tunic runs small, so you will need to order a size up.  The seams are well sewn with the stitching tight and secure.  This tunic top is very attractive and extremely WELL MADE!  It FEATURES an unbalanced hemline that really adds to its appeal and has short sleeves which is PERFECT for summer weather.\n\nWhat I love most about this tunic is that it is so VERSATILE!  You can match this tunic up with white capris, a nice pair sandals, a few accessories and you are ready for clubbing or a night on the town.  Pair it with a skirt and you have a truly ELEGANT look.  This tunic can also be dressed down and worn with a pair of blue jeans.  Lastly, this tunic can double as a beach cover-up.  Either way you choose to wear it, you will definitely turn heads as it is that ATTRACTIVE!\n\nAll in all, this is a great tunic top, looks amazing and is HIGH QUALITY!  It is washing machine safe but I choose to hand wash it to preserve its newness.  Honestly, it washes and hang dries so quickly, I find it easier!\n\nDisclaimer - I received this item for my honest and unbiased review.

These bras are made on a smaller scale with tighter bands, and more shallow cups set closer together. You will need to go up a band size or even two, and possibly a cup size if you really fill out your bra in this style. The Julia bra has a tighter band, shorter straps, and the cup is a bit larger than most other bras by this company. For example, if you typically wear a 32B, you would probably need closer to a 34A-B/36A in this bra. The nude/black seems to run smaller in the band than the dove/eggplant.\n\nFor further reference (especially if you are already familiar with the company), I comfortably wear a 28B in almost all bras from TLBC. In this one, I needed a 28A and had to purchase an extender, and am looking for replacement straps as they are too small to use as convertible straps. No regrets as the bra is otherwise comfortable and looks great. I do hope the company lengthens the band and straps on this style to coincide more closely with other TLBC bras in the near future.\n\nThis is a sporty looking bra which fits nicely under T-shirts while looking natural, and does not have an excessive amount of padding. There is a very small wedge of padding at the bottom for lift, and there are removable pads for extra lift, or to even things out. This one (nude/black) has a fine mesh-like overlay. Good bra in hard-to-find smaller sizes. Great bra!", "summary": "This bra is made and recommended for petite-framed women", "unixReviewTime": 1463356800}

We ordered a 7/8.\nShe loves it and that's what really matters. We haven't worn it out yet but I took pictures and she has recieved so many compliments! I can't wait for her to wear it out.

Anyway. let's get to the review.\n\nDescription of my daughter: 3ft, 9.5inches - 58Lbs - 7 years old (2 months away from 8, very close)\n\nMermaid tail piece and top run extremely large and the bottoms run small. The color of this suit is AMAZING. Very vibrant. The material is very soft and comfortable, very strectchy but is NOT a swimsuit material and is slightly see through. Due to the color of the suit it could probably get wet and be fine for the smaller girls as far as modesty is concerned. For developing girls i would reccommend getting a lining sewed in, especially the top. Both top and bottom could use a lining if you are good with sewing or want to spend the money at a tailor. The top is just TOO big, it falls off her body and will have to be altered for wearing. The bottoms have a bulge in the front and are tight on her bottom in the back. The skirt is slightly big, especially at the waist. The waistline could be a little tighter to help stay on her body. I don't mind the body of the tail being slightly big, just because it gives her room to walk comfortably if she wants to. The tail is long on her, but that is expected since she is short for her age.\n\nAlso I ordered the XXL which is 7-8Y but my tag says XL. My shipping sheet also states XXL. The tags do not have any numbers on them to referece the size. So, not really sure whats going on there. I received this item at a discounted price for my honest review. All opinions are my own. I would not purchase this at full price knowing all the alteraitions I would have to make for this to be Swim/ Wear read.

As a costume, I would say I like it, so 4 stars.  If you are looking for something as a functional swim suit, then my rating would be much lower.\n\nFirst of all, my daughter really likes it!  Who wouldn't want to be a mermaid!  While the skirt is the same material as the bathing suit, you wouldn't actually wear it in the water.  The material isn't really swimsuit material, so it doesn't fit and stretch like a swim suit would.  The fit is rather wonky and gaps in places.  My daughter is a \"normal\" size, and I rarely have issues with fit, however this was a little off.  The front of the bottoms gapped a bit while the back was tight and riding low (almost could see a plumber's crack).  The bikini top was way too big and kept falling down.  There is now way she could have worn this to swim, it wouldn't have stayed on her body.  The tail portion is a skirt with an elastic waist and fit as expected.\n\nThis arrived quickly and is in good condition (not falling apart, seems to be well sewn).  The material looks nice, like mermaid scales, though it's not the feel you would expect with swim wear.  It's comfortable with the exception of issues with the top falling.  It does look as pictured.  I purchased this at a discount price in exchange for an honest review.  My opinion is if you want this an actual bathing suit for summer, as a main use frequently in pool, then the mermaid suits aren't for you (all of them, from all sellers, in this material have these issues).  If you want something fun for your daughter to play in, possibly lounge by the pool, then I would recommend this.", "summary": "Fun for play, not for swimming!", "unixReviewTime": 1464912000}

So glad I found this swimsuit because we looked for something like this everywhere with no such luck. Looking forward to many summer swims in this swimsuit for my happy girl! Definitely recommend this swimsuit set and you cant beat the super fast shipping directly to your house without having to search through stores with little one.

I didn't think about a couple of things before ordering and they really make it a no dice kind of suit for out in public.\n\nPRos:\n\n1) cute enough. it does look like a cute little mermaid suit. I like that the bottom has good detail that looks like scales. That really adds to the suit in my book. IT also thrills my daughter to no end, so that is a plus!\n\n2) bottom is tapered enough, but the flare at the bottom makes walking a breeze! Love that this one won't trip anyone up!\n\n3) bottoms are cute, and the little ruffle is absolutely adorable!\n\nCons:\n\n1) the BIG con for me and what took the suit to 3 starts instead of a higher rating is that the top of the suit is really odd and big. it falls easily. No, I am not a prude and think it is the end of the world for a toddler girl, BUT I don't want every single person in a public pool to see that, either, nor do I want my poor child to feel any embarrassment from this issue.\n\n2) the leg openings on the bottoms are pretty big. I have a little one on the thinner side of average, so she is not a stick, and yet these leg openings have a bit more room than I would normally like. I would say the bottoms are made for a thicker build. IT is a super cute suit, and I think with a little help, it could be adorable. All in all it is a good one for our backyard pool and water fights!\n\nNote: I received the product at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review.", "summary": "cute, but some issues!", "unixReviewTime": 1468972800}

Item was packaged nicely. I ordered a size 130 cause I was sorta unfamiliar with what size my daughter would fit. She is a regular us size 4. This 130 is too big on her but other 130 items fit. So I hope this is just made a tad bigger. Oh well it does fit and will just fit her longer. All materials feel like regular swimsuit material. The top fits her well. Only thing is when wet the \"clams\" flap around. A nice tack stitch on each one will fix that problem. The bottoms fit her well and are super cute. The tail is really the only item that's too big. It goes a most to her chest while still touching the floor. We roll it a few times so it sits at her waist. This outfit is way cute though and holds up well washing so far. We are big mermaid fans and this outfit is wonderful. My 3 year old is super happy and so am I.

I am 5'4\", 300 lbs, and wear an 18/20 in tops, and a 24/26 in bottoms. The XXL fit me PERFECTLY and I couldn't be happier.

I'm a small, and while the chest piece covered all it should, it's a little tight. Also, the picture should have been clearer as to what the string in the back should be; it has arm hooks and a little string connected the two. It doesn't detract from the wearing, but it's slightly uncomfortable to wear, since it's, well, arm hooks, and smaller than the size.\n\nThe material is good and thick, and is a little shiny and looks cute! It's polyester, and had two inserts that didn't fall out in washing. I like this, but as the other reviews suggested, both the top and bottom piece is small. I would recommend getting another bottom to go with this, as I am a small and it doesn't fit comfortably. Which is why I took a star off, but otherwise, this is a good set of swimming wear :)\n\nThis product was provided at a /free discounted price in exchange for my honest review.

You put your change of clothes and toiletries in the bottom, and avoid cluttering up the main compartment with stuff you don't need for the flight itself. It slides over your suitcase handle, and has a nice outside pocket for tickets and such. And the long shoulder strap could go across your body, to make hauling it through the airport much easier, right? The design was exactly what I was looking for.\n\nIn reality, the long strap was too thin, and dug into my shoulder badly. So I ordered a shoulder pad that velcroed onto it, and figured I would be set for the trip. But the hardware on the shoulder strap snapped like a twig before I even got to the gate. Granted, I had it stuffed pretty full, but isn't that the point of a large bag like this?\n\nThe material of the bag itself was fairly plastic-y and stiff, but seemed sturdy enough, and the bottom corners were reinforced. It wasn't a terribly expensive bag, so I could have lived with that. But the hardware was beyond flimsy, and too small to take the weight of even an overnight-flight's worth of clothes and neck pillows. I continued to use it on my trip without the shoulder strap, but when it was expanded, it was too tall to carry by the handles without being kicked or dragging the ground; and they weren't quite long enough to make carrying it over my shoulder comfortable when it was full.\n\nOverall, a nice design, but the hardware needs to be sturdier.", "summary": "Nice design, but it broke before I even got on the plane", "unixReviewTime": 1471305600}

I tried my 15.5 inch laptop in it and it definitely doesnt fit. There are mesh pockets on the side and a nice sized front pocket as well as a secret pocket in the back.\n\nThe shoulder straps are adjustable and padded like most backpacks and are extremely comfortable. Construction is really really nice on this. No hanging threads or ugly stitching anywhere. Definitely a really nice backpack.\n\nWhile the design is abstract, it reminds me of tropical palm fronds.

Nice packaging comes in a clear plastic zipper bag for storing. I think this strapless self adhesive bra would work best when wearing something that already has a built in bra or a halter type shirt or dress that has a high waisted band under your breast area. It is also to small I ordered a D cup and I'm more like a full C cup. I had side breast coming out even though I applied it as far to the sides of my breasts as I could. Seems you could wear it more than once and just reapply the plastic cover that covers the inside sticky part of the bra cups. On the plus side it does push your breast together for a nice cleavage. Just don't wear it with out some sort of other structured top or dress over it. In the picture of the product it appears to me she is also lifting her breast up which is not how it works when worn by itself alone without some other type of support. It does not push up it does however push together your breast.\n\nI received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Feeto Strapless Self Adhesive Bra Breast Pads", "unixReviewTime": 1465776000}

I am a big girl (side 18-22 depending on the outfit) & I have big boobs (normally 40 DDD), and on top of that, I'm currently a breastfeeding mom so they are huge! The empire waist band is actually on part of my boobs (see pics) instead of underneath.  I'm sure that for most people they would not have this issue.  Also, being a nursing mom, it would be impossible for me to nurse without getting totally undressed.\n\nOn a side note: the dress lays flat, but is probably best with crinoline/ petticoat / tutu underneath it.  In my pics, I'll show it with & without a petticoat.  The dress is definately designed to accomodate several layers of petticoats, so don't limit yourself to just one layer!\n\nAlso, and this it's totally a laziness factor for me, the dress is hand wash only.  I plan on washing this on the gentle cycle & hand to dry. I'll update on how the dress holds up.\n\nDisclaimer:  I received this product at a discounted price for reviewing purposes.

The pin-up look has been making appearances all over the place recently.  Weve been buying and trying different dresses from different companies.

It was well packaged in a resealable plastic bag.  Much better than the cheap bags that some of the dresses come in.\n\nThe size and labels were clearly visible outside of the bag, so we could make sure it was right before we took the dress out of the bag.\n\nThe first thing we noticed when we took it out of the bag was the color and pattern were just as they were in the picture.  The cherry pattern was consistent with no appearance of defects.\n\nThe stitching used to make the dress was done very well.  It was not a cheap single stitch.  It was done really well so we aren't afraid of it pulling apart.  The skirt itself is hemmed at the bottom instead of the poor stitching that some dresses have.\n\nThe dress size chart matched what we received.  I can say there is no additional fabric to let out the dress to make it a bigger size.  If in doubt, order the bigger size.\n\nThe fabric was average.  It was not too thin or too thick.  When standing in front of light you cant really see through the skirt so its a fairly dense material.\n\nIf you like this style of dress then you would probably want to try this one out.\n\nI did receive this product at a discount to provide an honest review of it.

So if you're getting the light color ones, you'll have to wear a slip underneath. Or I suggest to get the darker color ones. The fabric is not too great, I think this dress will look more elegant with a better Chiffon fabric. Another thing I don't like about this dress is when I put it on, the dress comes out of the necklace like neckline making this difficult to put on.

Now I suppose if I decided to wear heel that it would be a perfect length but if I decided to wear flats it would be too long. The other thing that is a downer about this dress is the chain that is used to hold this dress together. So what I mean is, its gold and it's like a necklace that loops through the fabric of the dress and hooks in the back of the dress. This is a pretty incentive and when I put on the dress it actually fits over my head, but it pulled my hair, it also pulled the hair on my neck so I imagine with everyone who has long hair it will probably pull hair. It also is very difficult to unlatch. Very difficult, I had to have help. This dress is also double layered throughout the entire dress, but you will still need a slip or something underneath. It was completely see through, and not just a little, a lot. The center does fit perfectly it is not too tight and it is not too loose. It fits where I want it too and does not slide down.\nThis item did arrive rather faster than I expected and even though there is plenty of complaints, I do like this dress.

I got the one for the Galaxy S7 and it fit perfectly.

I found these online and had to get them because they look just like a pair he has wanted but a quarter of the price. I couldn't believe these. My son LOVES them! They are a very high quality set of sneakers. He said they are very comfortable to wear. The sneakers are very high quality meaning they have been to lots of different environments, from down pouring rain and win to bright sunny days. He said the traction on these are very good where he wasn't slipping and sliding after being outside in the rain and going back into school. My son said they are very comfortable, much like the expensive brands he has as well. By far, these specific flashing LED light up sneakers are his favorite. The fact that they display eleven different colors is beyond very neat. They charge very quickly with the charging cords that were sent with the sneakers. Simply plug in one USB and then it branches out to two different charging cords so he can charge both at the same time. We highly recommend these to others. I purchased these at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "My son absolutely LOVES these LED light up sneakers!", "unixReviewTime": 1465430400}

The side and the back both have padding.\nThey feel heavy if you pick them up but kind of light when you are wearing them.\n\nI struggle a little bit putting them on, I guess that's why there's a little thing at the back that I use to pull the shoes up and I can wear them.\n\nI think they are more of a slip on, the laces don't really do anything for me, except for decoration so they gave an impression of a sneakers.\n\nI picked the black/gray color as they are more my style but they do have other colors to choose from.\n\nI'm a size 6 and they are true to size, and as I said, I'm comfortable wearing them with socks or no socks at all.\n\nI like that the lights are rechargeable rather than battery operated, although I think batteries have some pros in some aspect.\nBut recharging them using micro USB cable which are included makes much more sense for me.\n\nYou can find the switch on both sides of the shoes and thats where you charge them too.\n\nYou can pick any color that you want, my son already told me that he prefers it to be green, or you can let it run it's colors.\n\nThe lights can also flash or blink.\n\nI'm not sure if this can be good for running, since I don't run but it certainly is useful for me while walking my dog at early morning or at night time.\n\nThere are times when our group of friends decide to walk our dogs at night, or just merely cross to the park.\n\nI think that the style is unisex and can be used by either a girl or a boy.\n\nTheres just one thing I don't like, which is that the lining seems to be peeling off, nothing that a glue cant fix of course, but I do plan on taking them out and replacing them with a custom sole or something for my pain. I just have to research what is good for me but all in all, it is a good purchase.\n\n*Disclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.

However, I was very pleasantly surprised when I received the scarf in the mail. It arrives folded in a square and tucked into a plastic pouch. The scarf itself is made of a very lightweight, breathable material, which makes it great for summer. (Just not Boston summers.... where it gets so hot and humid that anything extra touching your skin is the worst...) The green isn't as bright or pastel looking as it shows in the product photo, which makes it perfect. The design is cute, and it goes well with a simple black dress. It's perfect to add a bit of extra color.\n\nThe biggest benefit of this scarf is definitely the materials it's made out of. I hate bulky scarves that make me feel like I'm choking (I have a weird aversion to wearing things around my neck for that reason), but this is so light and airy that I don't feel like I'm choking at all.\n\nOverall, I'm quite pleased with this scarf! Would recommend. The price all told, though, I'm not sure I would have paid full price for this. It's lovely, but not something I would have gone out of my way to buy this.\n\nI received this product for free in exchange for my honest feedback. I will be certain to update this review if my opinion is to change in the future!", "summary": "Great polyester scarf, nice and lightweight", "unixReviewTime": 1467849600}

I have to be super careful when I am wearing it not to get anything on it and ruin it. I want this to last as long as possible.\n\nThe lace design on it is so pretty and very well made. There is not fraying on it or broken spots even after the wash . I do wash this on the delicate cycle as well as dry it on delicate or hang dry it.  The fabric is very soft and the way it moves on your body feels really nice. Im so in love with this though the style is so interesting and pretty.

The back is the racer back style, which is both popular and cute. I saw a shirt that looked identical to this one in a Venus catalog and I ordered it. It was about $35.00. When I saw this shirt on Amazon and it cost so much less than what I had paid for mine, I ordered it. Well thank goodness I didn't get around to returning the first shirt to Venus, because unfortunately the shirts look just alike online but they do not look just alike in reality. The difference is in the quality of the anchor on the front of the shirt. The REAL shirt, ordered from Venus, has gorgeous gold sequins completely filling in the shape of the anchor outline. The cheap shirt from Amazon has what looks like some gold glitter scattered around in the outline of the anchor. It's a huge difference! If I had never seen the shirt with the sequined covered anchor, it's possible that I may have worn the glitter scattered shirt, but it looks as cheap as it is, so I probably would never have worn it. I'm glad I didn't return the original shirt to Venus and it makes me mad that the shirt pictured on Amazon looked exactly like the picture of the shirt in the Venus catalog. Returning the shirt to Amazon would cost me almost as much as I paid for it, so I suppose I will give it to Goodwill. If you like the way the picture of this shirt looks and want to buy it, go to venus.com, find the shirt and order it there. Don't order the shirt here and expect it to look like the shirt in the picture, because if you do, you'll be very disappointed.", "summary": "This shirt is a poorly made, cheap knock off of a very pretty shirt from Venus.

I had no shrinkage though I cannot attest if it would dryer shrink because I line dry my clothes.

While the large was form fitting on the top and a little too loose on the bottom, the pants are a touch too long. I am not the most graceful of people and find myself tripping repeatedly on the pants hem. Additionally, and probably more importantly, the style of the pants highlights my thighs and, weirdly enough, my thighs look bigger than they actually are.\n\nSince I tend to buy pants that downplay my thigh size, I am a bit non-pulsed to wear these in public. The problem may rest in the material, which has a light sheen, and may highlight those imperfections some of us have. This is one of the challenges with buying on the internet, I can't try on the pants ahead of time, to see how they look.\n\nAs others have noted, and while not a deal-killer for me, the material looks like a dark pair of jeans, but is soft like sweatpants. The pants, if you could find the right size, would probably look good with boots, since they do have a boot cut for the leg.

The pull tab feature is very helpful for getting your cards out of the center pocket. I'm coming from a simple card sleeve and wanted just a tad more space.\n\nThe deal breaker for me was that the outer pockets which are supposed to be \"quick access\" are completely unusable with any cards in the middle pocket. The only way to get them out is to take the cards out of the middle pocket first so that you can bend the top of the wallet out of the way to get your finder under neath and grab from both sides, they are way too tight to simply slide your thumb over the card. This is probably fine with something flexible like cash but the whole reason I bought this wallet was to have a quick access outer pocket for my main card that I use every day, and I was hugely disssapointed.\n\nAll it would take would for their to be a cutout on the bottom of the outer pockets so that you could push the card up from the bottom and this would be in my mind, the perfect minimalist wallet, but as it stands now it's basically a card sleeve with a pull tab. If that's all you want and a pocket on the outside for some cash, this is a great card sleeve, but don't expect to be able to use the outer pockets for cards, there's no point, you can't get them out and may as well just put them in the center pocket.\n\nThe leather is really nice though and I'm going to see if there is another Andar product that more matches what I want,", "summary": "So close,  but fatally flawed", "unixReviewTime": 1485388800}

Without these glasses, he named every single flower's color wrong, without fail. He then trued these glasses on... and he instantly saw the world differently! I swear he named every single color correctly with these on. Ironically, a store worker passed by and asked to try them on (he happened to be colorblind too) and he was shocked how big a change they made. Both the worker and my son stood agape, taking these glasses off and putting them back on, looking around.\nSince these are adult sized, I returned them and ordered the child sized ones for my son. Every time he messes up his colors when playing with his friends, they remind him to put these on. He doesn't wear them often (he's afraid of breaking them since they're so expensive), but it really has changed his life, knowing that he has then when he wants them, such as during Art class.\n\nThat being said, my nephew didn't seem to have the same results.

It fits smaller around the waste it's a bit difficult to get over my thighs but I manage lol. but the cup size in the bra area....well... its a bit big for me. I feel like if the bottom as a size bigger and the cup size was a size smaller it would be perfect, but I can make it work. for $12 awesome it looks great. The straps clip in so you can take them off or put them on but since the cup size is to big for me I need them, but they hardly stay in place.

It seems well made of a medium weight denim, securely stitched and flattering.  The color is not a deep solid black, there are some grey fabrics woven in to give an uneven appearance more equivalent to denim.  You can see this in the picture so I knew what I was receiving.  I thought I'd like this look as I had another Style J skirt in solid black and was looking for something different.  However, once I received it, it just didn't appeal to me once I tried it on and so I returned it.  However, that's a matter of taste.  Another issue I had with this particular skirt is the fullness at the bottom.  I own another Style J skirt in this same style that is a medium blue and thought they'd be identical except for the color.  But the hem of this black one is about 2\" wider than the other one and for someone as short as me, that makes a big difference.  It just looked to large for me.  I'm only 4'11 and always have to hem my Style J skirts because they're so long but if you're taller, I think the fullness will actually be a bonus.  As to the sizing, like all Style J skirts they run on the small size.  I generally wear a size 6 skirt but in Style J, size 8 fits perfectly.

It would have been ok if she had separated the strand a little because it is somewhat misleading. The  beads do not looks like sandalwood. I am not saying they are not because I do take the sellers word for it but they seem to be treated  but there is no wood smell either. The length of this necklace is 20 inches and this can be used as a bracelet or a necklace. The beads are strung on elastic. There is an extra 4 inches on the bottom of the necklace with some nice handmade beads. I do have a problem with the very tiny jade bead. If I did not know better it look very close to a swastika. To me this is very insulting since my mother was shot in the back by the German's in world war 2, I hope the seller will change this in newer models.  The color of the beads is very rich. The elastic this is beaded with is pretty thick so it looks that this bracelet/ necklace will hold up very good,\nI received this product at a discount/free for my honest/unbiased opinion.

I always order up a size or two when I know items are coming from China as they tend to run a bit small.  So I ordered the XXL hoping for the best.  Here's what I liked about the blouse....the colors were bright and vibrant, and the material is light, soft to the touch and cool, making it a great choice for summer.  But, here's the problem I found...as others have stated, the blouse has a seam that runs from the zipper sideways around to the left hip? The zipper on the 2 shirts I received were sewed on at a slight slant?  Which made it hang a little weird?  I did not see this in the picture?  I also thought for a size XXL the shirt was a little snug in the bust.  It did seem full enough in the middle but with the sleeves running way too small in the width and short in the length, it was a FAIL for me!  Looked nothing like the picture, full in some areas and tight in others, leaving it looking way out of proportion.  What a shame!

The clear cubic zirconia in the center catches light from every angle to sparkle brilliantly, and the apple is very nicely detailed.\n\nThe pendant is set on a delicate 16\" 14k white gold plated sterling silver box chain with a 2\" extender and spring ring closure, and the small leaf at the end of the chain is stamped S925 which indicates the metal is 925 sterling silver. I think it's the perfect size for a young lady, but the bale is large enough that you could swap the necklace out for a longer one if you wanted to as well.\n\nI like wearing sterling silver necklaces because they're hypoallergenic and they don't irritate my skin, but I don't like how sterling tarnishes so I appreciate the fact that this entire piece is white gold plated so it will retain it's luster without tarnishing.  This necklace is well made, very pretty, and comes in a lovely jewelry box fit for gifting. It would make a nice gift for a young lady or for her teacher.\n\nSample provided by manufacturer at no cost for evaluation.", "summary": "Charming necklace for a young lady", "unixReviewTime": 1465430400}

There is what looks like a bird of paradise leaf at the top, again it looks like a shadow and you can miss it. The fit is very true to size. It is a slim fit cut, its not wide at the bottom. The material is soft to the touch and even though its not a very thick material it falls nicely and is a good weight. It does not seem like a cheaply made shirt. It is made of 94% polyester and 6% spandex. I think the small amount of spandex is what gives this shirt the nice feel that it has and allows it to fall so nicely when its on. This is a great shirt, I plan on giving it to my nephew who is serving in the military. I think he will enjoy wearing it.\nI received this shirt at a discount to try, test and give an honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "looks great!", "unixReviewTime": 1467504000}

These days for me are hard to find things that fit me. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, and was put on Lyrica. Well, just as one of the side affects said, I gained weight. I went to weighing 115 ( all my life ) to 170 in a matter of months. I had to buy new clothes. It was really hard for me to pick out clothes. I had to keep buying different sizes. I couldn't wear all the cute clothes I once wore. I became severely self conscious. I found myself buying clothes that covered my stomach, arms,.... Things I never had to worry about all my life. So this dress was just fine with me. It is short, just as the photo shows, so I wore some basic shorts under it.

It is so so pretty. I would of gave it 10 stars. I ordered an XS and it is close to perfect... i say close because its only big on me at the shoulders.... The cantalope color is beatiful. I MUST say if you like the picture well the real thing is even MORE fabulous. I tried it on and feel very comfortable.\nThe chest section where the dress has the buttons i thought was just one piece all across but there is a line dividing and it is joined by a little sewing job that holds it together... the pleads on the side are awesome, i must straighten them out before I wear the dress for real. The length of the dress is also a HUGE PLUS PLUS for me since i love dressing modest and its difficult to find dresses below the knee, this is not soooo long but below the knee at a length that makes one look so elegant! One of my main concerns were what to wear under because the underwear is noticeable and of course it may be because of the color of the dress more than anything. That problem was solved for me after finding seamless shorts at Walmart in a nude color- perfect! You can find those near the underwear clothing section.\nI would Love for this dress to be made in ALL colors thats how pretty it is. When i tried it on i put my own belt and shoes and it looks stunning! ( Try a champagne or gold color, or wear as is). The dress is so beautiful that the most simple hairstyle would complement it. The one thing that i want to try is ironing it since it does come reasonably wrinkled ... but i wouldn't dare to put an iron directly on the material, i hope my Steamer would do the job. What more is there to say? Well this dress for the price is awesome... give it a try if you like it, i have no regrets... I would love to get another one!\nAnd no my review is not me just overdoing it, i really wanted to transmit my happiness over this dress... it looks very pretty on me Trust me I got so many compliments wearing it.  I would love for many of you to look pretty in it as well!\n\nSomeone had commented that the dress took forever to arrive, i ordered with Prime and i ordered it on a Saturday (July 1st) and received it on Wednesday (July 5th)....thats because there was a delay i assume because of July 4th ... otherwise it would of arrived sooner.", "summary": "AMAZINGLY PRETTY BEAUTIFUL", "unixReviewTime": 1499212800}

This dress is a long sleeve scoop neck dress. Due to the cut of the neckline, it has the tendency to slip of one shoulder. My husband really like this sexy off-the shoulder look. He finds it attractive to show a bit of shoulder and neck. I am 56 and the dress ends about mid-thigh. It can be worn as a mini-dress or as a shirt over pants or leggings. The sleeves of the dress are a bell sleeve and flare out, giving the dress a go-go bohemian appearance. The fabric of the dress is made of 100% rayon and is relatively soft and flowy. The design of the dress is multi-color with lots of different prints. The dress is a bit sheer so you will need to wear a slip underneath. I like how the colors of the shirt are a dark color so that it doesnt get dirty easily. The main colors on this dress are black, brown, red, and a bit of white. I wear this as a dress with boots and as a shirt over pants and heels. I have received a lot of compliments about the attractiveness of the dress. Overall, I am very pleased with my dress/shirt.

I love the pattern and breezy feel of this dress and look forward to wearing it later in the year.\n\nI ordered this adorable dress in a size large of the multicolor design.  The fabric is rayon, making it lightweight and breezy.  It is a perfect thinness  it is not too thin as to be see through or to show through bra edges, but thin enough to be perfect for warm days.  The dress is rayon only, so there is no stretch to the material.  The colors are beautiful and vibrant, exactly as shown in the listing, and the bell sleeves add to the romantic look of the dress.\n\nThis dress is perfect for many looks  alone, belted, or with leggings are my favorites.  When it is warm outside, it looks great on its own with sandals or with a belt and strappy sandals if wanting to dress it up a bit.  As it gets cooler outside, it can be worn with leggings or with knee boots  it will look adorable with a thick belt and boots of the same shade.\n\nUnfortunately for me, the bust sizing was off by four inches making this not fit me  the listing indicates a large is 42 but my dress is 38.  I have been losing weight, so I plan on putting this in the back of the closet to wear when my bust is a bit smaller.  I was going to gift to a friends daughter, who is a size medium, but the dress is too large overall on her and she did not care for the baggy look.\n\nOther than needing to size up a size or two for bustier gals, I love this dress.  The fabric and design are versatile and gorgeous.\n\nI received this dress for free in exchange for my honest review.", "summary": "Gorgeous, romantic style dress", "unixReviewTime": 1469404800}

I was skeptical about a $7.5 multi-function watch, especially one from the PRC.

As with most Chinese watches, the case is thick, but the synthetic rubber case -- much as you would find in a Casio -- lightens the watch weight.\n\nPROS:\nMulti-function: analog and digital time, 12 or 24 hr mode, alarm, stopwatch, blue view light for digital display, day and date\nJapan movement; accurate time\nAttractive display -- two small dials evidently for aesthetic purposes.  One alerts you to 24 vs 12 hour time -- as though you would not realize it; the other has no purpose that I can determine, but it's too small for me to use regardless.\nLarge buttons (good for us seniors)\nRelatively light for the dial and case size\nSynthetic rubber case great for outdoor use.\n\nCONS\nThick case -- 1/2 inch\nost savings is evidently gained by loose packing vs. a case or box.

The weight is mostly in the face and is likely due to the amount of gears, accessories and circuitry that it has to make it run. It definitely has a lot of options and functions like a timer, alarm, and stopwatch modes. It comes fully equipped with a back light for visibility in the dark. There are two additional options that I can't figure out but I probably don't need them anyway. For the price you aren't going to get a better watch. The movement is made in Japan and the the glass is made in Germany. The glass appears to be pretty solid. The band has the pins set in securely and is made of silicone that is flexible yet fairly thick. To put the icing on the cake it's also water resistant and it comes with a 2 year warranty from amazon. I don't think it get's any better than that for a whopping three dollars and fifty cents. If you are looking to get a watch for your kids that works well but you wouldn't mind very much if the kids loose it or beat it up a bit this watch is a great option without having to spend much. Unfortunately it does not include a box but for this price that's not surprising.\n\nI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. The fact that I received my item for free or at a discounted rate does not influence my opinion in any way, and my purpose for writing these reviews is to be objective in sharing the advantages and flaws of these products for fellow Amazon customers.

It shipped fine, but there is not even a cheap box so this is not really gift worthy.\nThis is a very big, thick watch.  If you like that, this won't be a problem.\nIf you're wondering what the 2 circular complications are on the face... so am I.  Even after reading the instructions because they are not mentioned.\nKeeps time OK. After a few days I noticed the digital clock was about 8 to 10 seconds ahead of the analog.  This may not be a big deal to you, but I wanted to let you know before you purchased this.\n\nRecommend?: 4 stars as an under 10 watch.  If you're looking for a toy, this is fine.  For a serious watch, I'd pass due to the inability to keep accurate time between the 2 modes.\n\nReviewed on: 7/15/16\nCurrent Price: $3.50\n\nI received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.\nI will be happy to try and answer any questions anyone may have about this product as I take the responsibility of reviewing very seriously and would not risk my integrity by giving a misleading review.\nIf this review was helpful to you, please take a second to press the Yes button below.", "summary": "OK, inexpensive watch", "unixReviewTime": 1468540800}

It has the black on the sides of the waist so it gives the illusion that you are thinner than you really are. However, this is a little thinner in the hip area than I thought. It fits very snug. My hips are about 34 inches and I ordered a small, so the hip area is about the same width as the waist area. If you have a narrow waist and hips then this shouldn't be a problem for you. Other than this minor consideration, I love this short dress. I am 5' 5\", and I would never dare to wear this as just a dress because this is just too short. I would always wear this with leggings.  Overall, I love the style and design and how the focus takes the gaze off the waist and places it on the upper check and toward the navel section creating a streamlined, hourglass effect. The material is thin but due to what the material is made of it isn't very breathable. I wore this on hot days though and didn't have any problems.\n\nPlease check out my video pending approval.

The style is quite Boho and very unique. While its colorful and intricate, its not tacky or over the top as well and its quite elegant looking. This would make a great casual or semi-casual dress for spring and summer.\n\nThe dress itself is quite short so it also makes as a great tunic as well. I really like the flared half-sleeves and the modest boat neck. The material is 100% polyester and is quite thin. It would be slightly sheer if the design and color is white, but thankfully the black and colorful design blocks out everything and is opaque enough to wear comfortably.\n\nI must warn that this dress is quite rigid in sizing. The material of the dress is not stretchable at all and there is no extra give, so make sure you purchase this in the right size. I wanted a looser fit in case so I bought in a size up. I was right to order a size up because I almost couldn't fit my head through the collar (due to my large head).  I also have broad shoulders and it was quite hard to fit my arms through the dress sleeves when I pulled it over my head.\n\nThe dress also has an attached string belt to give your waist some definition and tapering effect. I think this is a good fashionable addition and makes the dress look quite nice. You can also detach the string if you like since the small sewn on belt loop is quite unnoticeable.\n\nOverall, I feel that this is a very cute and chic Bohemian dress with a unique ethnic flare. I think making this dress in a more forgiving stretchable material would make the dress more wearer-friendly for more people out there and enlarging the head hole would be great for people with large heads like me. Still, this is a lovely dress that I see myself wearing quite often.

It arrived intact.\n\nThere is no headband as mentioned in the description. It is an alligator clip/clippie underneath that you can use to attach to your hair. The plus of using an alligator clip is complete invisibility underneath the hat. The downside is that I don't think this will hold up in a strong wind or if I have to hug anyone. I am thinking of attaching this to a headband for more security.\n\nThe color of the hat matches what I saw on the monitor which makes me happy because the shade matches my handbag and dress perfectly. This is a surprisingly high-quality fascinator. The feathers are rather delicate, so I doubt that this will last many years. Fortunately, I only plan to wear it on a single day.\n\nThe description says this hat is made of wool and feather, but I don't see wool anywhere on this hat. I think this may be due to incorrect translation. The foundation/base appears to be made of sinamay, which is one of the most popular hat-making foundations in the world. It is woven from the processed stalks of the abaca tree, a banana palm native to the Philippines. Abaca fibre is three times stronger than cotton or silk, and a fabric made from 100% abaca can last for over 100 years. As a result, sinamay holds a very firm shape and is commonly used in fascinators. The flower on the hat is clearly made of mesh.\n\nI think the hat looks larger in the photo than it is in person. Expect a hat that is 10.6 x 8.6 inches.\n\nThis arrives in a really good quality square storage box that has a pull out, drawer style box inside the cover of the box that stores the hat nice and flat.\n\nI had an opportunity to purchase this at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.", "summary": "Perfect for Opening Day at the Races", "unixReviewTime": 1464480000}

I don't feel like any board shorts are worth $65, but I sucked it up and bought them anyway because it's the color I really wanted. Other then price, my only negative comment would be that the carabiner with tiny flashlight are completely unnecessary imo. I mean, these are mostly intended to be swimming shorts...so why on earth do i need a flashlight or compass (last year model came w/carabiner and compass). Maybe ditch the uneccesary hardware and drop the price accordingly. Then I'd give these shorts 6 stars out of 5.\n\n**revised down to two stars. After 2nd washing the drawstring came out and is IMPOSSIBLE to re-thread back in.

After reading other reviewer comments discussing this item running a bit small, I ordered this one size higher than she would of normally chosen for herself and despite the larger size, the blouse fit perfect bordering on a bit snug tight but a very good body fit.  This means for this brand, sizes are approximately 1 to 1 1/2 sizes smaller than listed so for this item I recommend everyone get at least one size larger than normal as the fit on this blouse definitely runs smaller than labeled size.  The material is very sleek and silky elegant,  thinner than expected but not see through as my daughter was initially worried might be a problem but turned out quite nice.  It is very form fitted to the body but because of the crossing design in the fabric does a very good job of minimizing any extra flesh around the sides that some women might be a bit more conscientious about particularly in more form fitting clothing.  As for fit,  it seems the design of this garment is designed for those with thinner body profile but a bit fuller bust.  Those either flatter chested or wider around the hips may find the cut a bit disproportionate and might need to compensate by further adjust sizing.  In my daughter's case,  everything was about perfect fit on all sides just going one size over her normal size.  If she had ordered her normal regular size however,  the blouse would have to of been returned for being much too small so definitely keep in mind that the sizing on these do run a bit small.  In her case, ordering one size larger worked out perfect!  The only notable compliant either of us noticed is the stitching on the left side where the crossing pattern is sewn seems to be uneven and not aligned in one small area where perhaps it were possibly hand stitched or otherwise not perfectly level.  I don't know how noticeable the extra fabric is on that one seam side is in public being form fitting.  Because of this one small defect as well as the sizing running a bit small, I reduced the rating by one star..  Otherwise,  this blouse is amazingly beautiful and is a good pick for anyone who can wear it. A good choice in the closest for business lunches or special events.", "summary": "Beautiful sculpted silky close to body fitted blouse", "unixReviewTime": 1471132800}

The dress arrived and is very cute. It looks just like the picture above and is actually very nice quality and made out of very nice material. The top is padded which is very nice because I am not really sure how you would wear a normal bra with this dress unless you work a bra that was backless/strapless or no bra at all. The straps are adjustable in length and there is a nice sturdy zipper in the back of the dress. I am a size 0 and my sister is a size 2 and both about 5'1\" to 5'4\" and after looking at the sizing chart and reviews on other products as they said that the clothes seems to run small. With that being said, we decided to order this dress in a size medium...we are usually a small or x-small. Going with the medium was a good idea as the dress fits perfectly in length. The only thing that we really aren't a fan of is the front area. It is loose fitting so it is hard to decided how to wear it or to get it to fit correctly.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this dress but I would recommend that you order it in a size up. I think that it is going to be too short and small if you order the size that the size chart suggest. The material is very nice and soft though and the color and design of the dress is just like it is pictured.\n\n****I received this product at a discounted priced in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.***", "summary": "Very cute, runs small", "unixReviewTime": 1467936000}

The straps are a bit large for me, but everywhere else it fits great! I just secured the straps together behind my back and that fixed that problem! I wear a size 16/18 in women's sizes so I ordered a xxx in this suit.  The bottoms have ties on the side to adjust for size, you can tighten or loosen them as needed. The top is really cool, it has a bra type underneath the shirt, and it covers in all the right places. It leaves it loose in the front down to a fitted bottom. This suit is very comfortable and light weight to wear. The inside part covers your chest front and side, but the top part dips down on the sides for a peek a boo effect with the inside stripes. You can see just a little bit of skin on the sides but everything important is covered. I love the looseness in the front and belly area, it makes it more comfortable for larger women who don't want to show it all off, but want to show some.

The top ran true to size for me - I'm 5'0 and wear size S (0-2) women's clothing.  The top fit comfortably without feeling too snug or loose.  The straps are a bit on the shorter size, as I had to extend them near all the way to wear the top comfortably.  The inside of the swimsuit is lined at the bust area, although I can't say it gave much support.  There is a small amount of padding as well as thin strap of elastic to help hold everything upstairs in place.  I would've liked a bit more support in the top area, but it's okay as is since it is swimwear and not running wear.\n\nThe colors and design on the swimsuit top are bright and vibrant and the pattern is as pictured in the product picture.  The material is thick, but not so thick that the suit gets hot, and the stitching is even and well done.  The suit top washed well, and didn't fade after a day at the pool and a hand washing afterwards.  I typically hand wash my swimsuits in cold water with a small amount of Dreft or Woolite in the water, then air dry.  I'm not sure what would happen if you wash your suit in the machine, and I probably won't test it out anytime soon.\n\nOne thing to note is that this top does NOT come with a bottom.  This is not a big deal since a lot of stores carry separate top and bottom pieces, but it would've been nice to get those boy shorts as in the picture.  Luckily, black swimsuit bottoms are not hard to find, so note - you will need to get your own.\n\nFYI - I was selected for this opportunity to review this item free of charge.

I tried the XL first and it was too baggy on me. So I exchanged it for the large. The straps were still somewhat baggy, meaning I still had room in the bust which was surprising, as I am pretty large in the bust and usually have issues where everything fits but the bust is too small. However, the length of the dress doesn't accommodate for a big bust. The front of the dress was about three or four inches higher than the rest of the dress due to the four inches of bust sticking out. Also, there is a seam that goes around the dress, and because of the bust, the seam goes up high in the front and lower in the back. So although there may be ample space in the upper part of the dress for a larger chest, the more your chest sticks out, the higher the front of the dress and the front seam will go, and it ends up looking awkward. The dress is also short enough as it is, and having the front come up even higher wasn't a good look.

The seams are even and clean. I like the little details on shoulders and the shorts. The belt is just an accessory. It is not the most solid belt but it fits it's purpose.\n\nI added some photos to help you get a better idea of the fit. I ordered it in the color: Purplish Blue. I apologize for the lighting.

I have purchased the Fishers Finery yoga pants and really like them. I ordered the white nursing bra in an xl size for my daughter, she likes it so much she has started wearing it already. She is expecting late this year and is really looking forward to nursing the baby.\nThe material is a nice organic cotton blend with bamboo and spandex. It is exceptionally soft and super stretchy. It's thicker to give the breasts some support and help keep breast pads in place. There are no clasps or elastic straps to dig into your shoulders or back. It was very comfortable and the material feels silky smooth against your skin.\nThey suggest you order a size larger than your pre pregnancy size. I agree after I tried it on personally to test the fit. It fit me perfectly and I would normally wear a large size.\nThis bra will be very cool and comfy while breastfeeding. I will return and update my review after the baby comes and the bra begins to be used for breastfeeding.\n\nI received this nursing bra for free in return for my unbiased opinion.", "summary": "Soft comfortable high quality nursing bra", "unixReviewTime": 1475280000}

I have not had any particular issues with putting it on or taking it off like other reviewers, but I have to confess that I have to size up my swim suits due to being a more busty gal.

I will be honest though; I am using this for back support while lifting weights.\n\nI found this to be accurate as far as sizing. Since I am not using this to slim my waist, I ordered one size up and went with the medium; I wanted it to hug my body without squeezing too hard. I checked the measurement chart and it was true to size when I received the item. I highly recommend you measure before ordering.\n\nThe waist trainer is very comfortable. Other trainers that I have tried feel very stiff, which is uncomfortable not only for working out, but for moving about in general. That also means that they kind of pucker, so you absolutely cannot hide it under clothing. This one, however, was much different. It had a more stretchy, breathable fabric. It is snug and, while you cannot completely hide it under clothing, it looks much better than others. It does not pucker or anything, but you can still see the seams are clasps if the clothing is tight.\n\nThe clasps are very strong. You have 3 options for tightness. I took a picture of them because I was very impressed with the quality.\n\nMy only critic is very minor and I don't think it warrants deducting a star. The trainer kind of stunk when I first opened the package. After letting it air out, the odor completely dissipated. If it had stuck around, I would have made this review 4 stars. Since it is perfectly fine, I can't complain much.\n\nOverall, this is the best trainer I have tried (out of 3). It is well made and rather comfortable.

Firstly, the kit comes with a wafter of soft pure white wax which you melt and add a very small amount of your own breast milk to. So in a sense this kit is really just melted white wax and a very tiny amount of breast milk that is poured into the chosen piece of jewelry. The wax wafer is quite large and melts into a large amount, which in turn makes your quantity of breast milk even less significant within the pendant. I felt like I was basically just melting white wax with a couple of drops of my actual breast milk. The finished color of the piece only reflects the white wax (because that's basically all that's in it).\n\nMy second problem is wether or not the wax will actually stop my milk from going rotten. I have tried many other home ways to make a breast milk keepsake myself, and after only a couple weeks to months it tends to get discolored. I don't know if the wax will prevent this, I mean it is possible considering there is very little breast milk in it anyway, time will tell.\n\nThird and most importantly, I was not able to finish this pendant with the tools provided. The UV torch did not seal or cure the provided glue, at all. It has two buttons and two sides (see pic), one of the lights is a blue color and the other a white color. As according to the directions I held the light to the piece for three minutes, more considering I took care to do it all around it. I did this twice because the directions didn't specify which end to use. The torch doesn't stay lit you have to hold the butting down the entire time! It's a small button and it starts to hurt after about 30 seconds, which gave me sore fingers for no reason because it didn't cure.\n\nI ended up putting the pendant in my commercial UV nail curing machine for 180 seconds and it did cure the UV glue. If I had not had this machine at home I would not have been able to finish this pendant. I assume most people don't have one and don't want to spend an addition $60 to complete their keepsake. Also, the wax filled glass part ended up not being centered in on the middle of the metal part it is secured to due to having to put in the UV cure nail machine.\n\nReasons for only 1 star:\n\nPendant contains mostly white wax, not breast milk\nUnable to complete the pendant with provided tools\n\nSave your money, breast milk, and time.", "summary": "... make a keepsake of my own and I'm very disappointed with it", "unixReviewTime": 1482796800}

To finally build my confidence enough to actually purchase and then wear a swimsuit again after so long. I'm so extremely disapointed I probably won't even attempt to buy another suit again. Ever. I read the size chart, I read the reviews to make sure the size chart was accurate. It doesn't fit. I chose the Black dot swimsuit size 16. Which as I was reading was the size I needed for my height and weight. It doesn't fit. I wouldn't wear it in my house all by myself let alone out in public. My weight and height is not any different from any of the other reviews I've read, or the size chart says should fit. So I'm not sure how I received a suit so ill fitting, when it seems like most the reviews on here are positive saying for a 5'6\" with with a bigger chest this is great for. One of the questions even states, \" I noticed in all of the pictures that the women were more \"endowed\" on the top than I am. Will this suit work for a smaller chested woman?\nAnswer: I believe the suit will be ill fitted for smaller chested women. There is plenty of material to cover up the chest area. You don't get that squeezed in feeling. Being larger on top, this suit does offer comfortable support. \" The little cup of the top of the bathing suit didn't even fully cover my chest. I was falling out. It was uncomfortable.\n\nNo. Definitely not. Pretty sure it's for smaller chested women. Or smaller than me chested women. Wouldn't purchase again. Wouldn't recommend to anybody. Wouldn't even approach the subject. I'm happy for everyone who did find that it fit and worked out for them.", "summary": "Apparently not for everyone", "unixReviewTime": 1467417600}

This suit helps give me the confidence I wanted.\nIt is very thin material and the back of the bottoms are narrower than I really would have liked them to be. The front of the bottoms is great though. I like the tie straps on the sides, they do give a bit of adjustment. As for the top, I like that the straps are adjustable. They do have small plastic rings that hold the straps to the adjustment pieces and they do the job perfectly.  There are thin pads in the top, they are loose in there so putting the suit on and off they do not stay. I wish they had sewn at least a spot of them in place so that they didn't move around. Resetting them in to place is possible but its just a pain. Overall I am pleased with the suit and look foreward to many summer days out with the kiddos.

The weight loss after the second baby is struggle.  I ordered this in an x large because of the size measurement base on my chest size.  The top did fit around the chest around but the strap was too long.  I had to alter my top by cutting off 4 inches for this top to hold up well.  I am use to having to make alterations to my clothes so this was not a deal breaker.  The bottom fit well.  The material is not too thick so when I looked down after getting in the pool, I was glad to have groomed because it would have been noticeable.\nDisclosure : I purchased this item at a discounted price in exchange for my. honest unbiased review.

But, before I get into that, once I made some adjustments it worked great and is super cute!  (hence the 4 stars).  So, I said it was \"somewhat large\", but that's not really the whole story.  I bought the size based on what they suggested, and mostly it fit perfect!  The bottoms were great, the top was great.....except for the straps.  Even at their tightest possible setting they were comically large.  How tall do they think shoulders are?  The straps were crazy long!  Even if I tied them together in the back (like an \"X\") they were still way too long and not at all supportive!  I ended up tying a big knot in the straps (using a LOT of strap length) and once I did that, everything fit great!  I will probably sew a more permanent solution eventually, but right now, the knot works great.  The other issue with this suit (which doesn't really matter to me....) is that while the top and front of the bottoms are lined, the bottoms are not.  not an issue with color, might be an issue when you are talking about white stripes on the butt.  I know I don't want people to see my butt crack!  Now, why is this not an issue to me?  because I usually wear running shorts over my bottoms anyway because I'm chasing around a toddler and just need to be wearing water clothes while I do it.  So, I wasn't really looking for something to \"swim\" in per see.....but something more like a normal outfit to play with my son in and out of the water.  So, that's why I gave it 4 stars despite it's two problems....others might not want to work around those two issues, but for me, they don't matter because this is just what I needed!

It covers your stomach but still almost gives that appearance of the bikini. I purchased this one in the black and white. It is very flattering. I read the size chart. I currently wear a size 14 so I purchased this one in the XXXL. Sounds aweful but it fit right. So technically it runs small but because of the size chart it fits as expected. This swim suit is two pieces. The bottom ties on each size so it is adjustable and should fit perfectly within the size chart range. The material is made well. It is not too thin or thick. I am very happy with this swim suit. I have already worn it to my sisters house in her pool and am super excited to take it with me on a cruise I am going on in a few weeks.

The top has adjustable straps with a black tank top while underneath is black and white striped sports bra. These two pieces are sewn together and the bra has elastic on both the top and bottom. The black tank top covers both the back and stomach but features deep cuts in the side so it's still pretty appealing.  The bottoms are black and white striped with adjustable tie sides. The swimsuit is pretty true to size. I ordered a large which fits pretty great. the biggest down fall of this swimsuit is the \"adjustable straps\". While they are adjustable they are nowhere near as adjustable as they need to be. The straps are way too long even when adjusted to the shortest length. Since the back of the swimsuit is elastic, I just ended up cutting off the adjustable part of the straps and am now tying them up like a halter style top. That fixed everything! The only problem I have with the bottoms is when they stretch they begin to be see-through. The farther they stretch the more you can see. I think they should have lined the bottoms for better protection.\n\nOther than those two problems the swimsuit is great.

This would also be a good bathing suit for an expectant mother who is very early in a pregnancy to wear because it would cover up a bit of tummy and still look great. I do not think it would work as well for someone in the later stages of pregnancy, but everybody is different so what might work for one might not work for another.

When I pulled it out I was somewhat disappointed with the fabric. I was expecting something loose and draping. It was really stretchy, almost spandexy fabric that looked like it was gonna cling to my body instead of hang off of it. I got the largest size possible, I think the XXXL, but when I tried it on it clung tightly to my skin. I realized how thin the fabric was when it couldn't cover my DD's. I know I have somewhat largish boobs, that's why I got such a huge size, but the fabric was so thin and stretched so tight that you could see right through to my bra. The draping that I expected was nonexistent once I put it on. It looked like I had two weird inside out pockets right on my thighs. Not flattering and not what I paid for. I figured I might as well keep it as loungewear or something since I didn't want the hassle of trying to return it. That was a mistake on my part. Once I washed it a couple times (it smelled of plastic from shipping and the black was running a bit) I wore it around the house for a day. Had to take it off because the strap broke. Once I took it off I realized that it had dyed a large portion of my body light grey and purple. My bra and underwear were stained black wherever they made contact with it. My armpits were black and purple. Bear in mind, I had already washed this. Why should the color bleed that much after at least two washes? It shouldn't. I got a cheap imitation of what they show on the model. Don't waste your money, go to a store where you can try it on. Buyer beware.

Here are few options: you can contact the optical store, or buy ready-made glasses in the pharmacy department or in internet Amazon. The most reasonable would be to come to the doctor, who will diagnose vision and determine the required power of the lens. Let's say you were right, visited the doctor and received a prescription for glasses. Now you can order the glasses in the optical salon or buy ready-made. The cost of Reading Glasses will vary depending upon the lenses and wizard.  The order will take from a few hours to a few days depending on the salon that will execute your order. On Amazon, you can buy glasses without leaving the house, if you already have a prescription from a doctor and you know what type of glasses you need. But you need remember that every 3-5 years you will need replacement eyeglass lenses will be required. Today, we can find a large selection of ready-made reading glasses in different designs. Their main advantage - low price. Indeed, they can cost much less. In addition, you can quickly select the reading glasses and make a purchase, since it is not necessary to expect fabrication in the workshop.\nI ordered these glasses for my dad. He cannot read or write without glasses. Perhaps age had slightly worsened memory, or it's just a distraction, but he often forgets where he put his glasses. This set is wonderful. Delivery was fast. Points came very well packaged. It is very well made, it looks high quality and strong. The size of reading glasses is excellent. It is good to look at my father and mother. I can say that sunglasses really are well suited to women and men. My father was very pleased with this set of points. He said that he was very comfortable in this reading. The eyes do not get tired and do not distort the lens.\nI received this product at a discount or for free in exchange for an honest review. I often buy on the Internet and rarely go shopping.

It's also pretty simple to put your fitbit tracker in and out of the \"box\" of the clip.\nUnfortunately I still can't find a place to clip it where I can get an accurate count of my steps. The flex was designed for arm movement and it does have issues reading steps when you clip on your shirt, bra and waist band. Maybe for strenous exercise it will work better, but for everyday movement you will read much lower depending on where you attach the clip.

There is so much detail that looks gorgeous.

The bottoms fit a little bit big, the dress on the other hand won't fit her for quite some time. I think it will be more of a 12 mo. dress for her. The shoulder straps are pretty long. There is enough room in the bloomers though that they should fit at that time no problem.\nThe straps on the back of the dress cross and snap right above the tie. The crossed straps help to keep them on little girls. If you wanted to make them straight, you could just snap them in the other snap.\nThe thick lace on the straps is so darling and the open back look is really cute with the ruffles on the bloomers peeking out.

I did not want to spend very much for one. I saw this one and read the reviews and hoped it would be ok. It is not prime so it took a while to arrive and did get here faster than the estimated date. It came in a tiny plastic bag. No box or padding. It was folded and I wasn't even for sure what it was actually. I unfolded it and took out the strap and fastened it to the purse. The buckle and clasp are gold just as the picture shows. They seem sturdy enough. The purse is true to the color of the picture also. The purse and strap is lined in a grass like green color. This does not bother me because as I said - it is for Easter. But for someone only wanting a pink purse - this is probably not the one you want. There are three small compartments in side the purse. The strap is 26 inches long  when carried on the shoulder. This is measured from my shoulder to the purse clasp on the side of the purse. It is long enough for cross body. The actual purse part is 7 inches wide by 5 inches tall. I can fit the basics in there. Just a phone, keys, wallet, and maybe some mints or lipstick. This purse would not be sturdy enough for every day - but fine for a special outing where a regular purse is not special enough. The material on the outside can be wiped clean with a cloth if it gets dirty. The material feels kind of like a washable place mat. It has a small texture to it. Also, I think this purse would also be cute for a little girl as a gift. I am happy with this purchase asit fits my needs.", "summary": "Pretty in tiny pink......", "unixReviewTime": 1484697600}

I ordered the Claret Red (Wine) color and it's a real nice shade. You can carry this purse in 1 of 2 ways. It has carry handles you can use or else there is a removable shoulder strap which is adjustable. The shoulder strap just hooks on with a clasp on each end. The clasps are easy to open and attach and hold nice and snug.\n\nOn the front of the purse there is a zipper pocket which is a gold metal zipper with a tassel pull attached which gives you something to extra to open and close the zipper with. The pocket is fabric lined with a nice lining and is good for holding your keys or cell phone. There are 2 small rivets and a gold name plate attached on the pocket which just dress it up some. On the back side you have another zippered pocket but this one is a plastic zipper and there is no pull on it. It is also fabric lined though.\n\nThe top main compartment zipper is a full length plastic zipper. On the inside you have 2 larger compartments with a zipper compartment in the center of them. The inside is all nicely lined with fabric and the lining is sewn very well and nice thickness. On the one wall you have a small zippered pocket and on the other side wall you have 2 sewn in wall pockets with one being a little larger than the other. Depending on what type and size phone you have, you may be able to store your phone in the larger one.\n\nAll the zippers work well and I have not had any issues with them sticking or separating. All the hardware on the purse is gold color. There are buckles on the outer sides which are there for dressing it up. The bottom of the purse is flat so when setting it down on the floor or a table it will stand up without tipping over. Overall, this is a nice quality purse with a lot of storage room inside. It is soft and not stiff at all. I am very pleased with this and would recommend.\nI received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.", "summary": "Very Nice Quality With Lots Of Room!", "unixReviewTime": 1466380800}

As expected from the Delsey brand, these pieces are well constructed and will last a long time.  However, as mentioned in the title of this review  this 21 bag will NOT fit in the bag sizers for most domestic flights, so you cannot carry it on the plane (see explanation below)!  Its nice luggage, but be prepared to check both pieces.\n\nPros:\n- Very lightweight and easy to maneuver.\n- 4 spinner wheels keep the bag moving smoothly over changing terrain (carpet, tile, escalators, concrete, cobblestones).\n- Solid zippers, nice exterior pockets, and both bags are expandable.\n- Waterproof pocket, which is great for wet bathing suits or for paranoid travelers who worry about toiletries leaking all over their clothes.\n\nCons:\n- Minimal interior pockets  mesh pocket and waterproof pocket only.  No other compartments.\n- The biggest issue with the 21 bag is that it will not fit in the bag sizer for most domestic flights.  Though Delsey states the bag is 21, that is just the actual bag part.  Twenty-one inches should technically meet the 22 length restriction for most major airlines, but when measured with the wheels and handlethis Delsey is actually 23.5.  The bag still fits in the overhead bin on most planes, but if you're asked to put this in the bag sizer before boarding, you will likely find yourself unsuccessfully trying to stuff it in the metal box and ultimately you will have to gate check it before you board the plane.  On my outgoing leg of a trip I was able to get it on the plane with no problem.  But on my return flight the associate at the check-in counter gave me a hard time and made me put it into the sizer, and the bag did not pass so I had to check it in.\n\nAll in all, I give this luggage set 3 stars.  The luggage is great quality and will hold up to routine travel.  But given the fact that you would expect a 21 bag to function as a carry-on bag, I was very frustrated to find out the bag did not meet the size requirements for most airlines.\n\nUPDATE:  After just a couple flights, a wheel on the carry-on size bag busted off. I checked the bag in (because I had to, it doesn't fit as a carry on for most airlines), and when I picked up my bag from the carousel, a wheel just clean broke off so that all that is left is a metal stump.  Shoddy construction if it can only last 3-4 flights before breaking off like that.

Therefore, a nice one can make a big difference.  This one has a ton of smart and thoughtful features to make travel easier.  First, the wheels can rotate 360 degrees.  This means it is very easy to do a fast turn with the luggage.  As a short person, I appreciate that the handle telescopes and locks into two heights. I have done 2 flights with this since I received it and the carry on fit in the overhead luggage easily.  I didn't find it too heavy (and I am only 5 feet zero).  There is a zipper lined waterproof pouch which I have used for toiletries (if you have precheck and don't need to remove liquid and toiletries) and another mesh pouch for things like shoes or accessories.\n\nThe larger suitcase will be good for family travel.  I never bring a large suitcase when I travel for business but I do when I travel with my family.  The waterproof lining will be great for wet swimsuits.\n\nAnother nice feature is that the zippers are color coded.

Johnson", "reviewText": "I took this luggage on a trip to Vegas to test it out. The large one is huge and holds lots of stuff. The smaller is a perfect size for carry-on. The fabric is thick and seems of high quality and should last. The wheels spin so freely in all directions which makes it a breeze to pull, spin or push around the airport. Now the bad news. On this, its maiden voyage, when the larger size piece came off the baggage conveyor, one to the wheels had broken off! I was so disappointed that the wheel came off the first time I used it. It was a nightmare lugging this huge suitcase around with a missing wheel. To be fair, it could have been due to the baggage handlers at the airport. But, I have never had a wheel break off a suitcase before. The other thing that was troublesome, is the handle can easily pinch your finger when you push it down. I learned that the hard way- ouch! So overall, due to my experience I can't really give this a high rating.", "summary": "Wheel Broke off After First Use", "unixReviewTime": 1478217600}

I'm a huge fan of these suitcases, especially the big one.\n\nI was really impressed with these.  The large suitcase is absolutely huge, which was exciting because we have a large family.  The wheels roll smoothly and turn easily, which means our kids are able to help out with moving luggage through the airport (a significant plus with lots of kids).

It's ideal for traveling, with multiple pockets, O-rings that you can attach pouches and other organizational things to, and I've taken it on international as well as domestic trips as my one bag. I'm having surgery that will limit my ability to throw it on my back, though, so I need something wheeled until I recover.\n\nThis luggage seems to be good quality (although it doesn't match the quality of my current bag), other than the handle, which seems a little wobbly. It lacks adequate organizational pockets, and has no O-rings to attach things to. The smallest bag isn't carry-on size due to the wheels increasing the overall length (they shouldn't say it's 21-inches unless it measures that *with* the wheels), so it's not ideal unless you don't mind checking your luggage.\n\nAll that said, I was impressed with the wheels (smooth, very easy to push, pull, walk with me on a variety of surfaces), and was also impressed that it didn't tip over, even when I didn't distribute the weight evenly while packing. With previous wheeled luggage I've owned, they always tipped over when full, so this is a big improvement.", "summary": "Decent quality, larger than expected, great wheels, doesn't tip over", "unixReviewTime": 1477267200}

Two weeks in Greece. On one bag, the wheel was somehow shredded after my flight from Houston landed in Mexico City. The second bag lost a wheel somewhere from Mexico City to Zurich to Athens to Crete. The bags were checked all the way so I didn't see which point int the trip this occurred.\nI am absolutely astonished that having two bags, they both failed in a huge way that made moving either bag a huge pain in the ass. The only way they could have failed in a worse way was for the zippers to have broken and for the entire contents of my bag to have been lost.\nWith products like luggage it is definitely not a good idea to review them before actually using them, however, having used a wide range of luggage over the last 20-30 years, I have NEVER EVER seen a bag (no matter the cost - ranging from $50 to $199) experience a materials failure like loosing a wheel until at least 5-8 years of use.\n\nSO - ok I have a wheel shredded, and I lost a wheel - so how about a repair under warranty? well even if I can get them replaced under warranty, whatever manufacturing defect caused me to loose a wheel is still in the bag so I don't feel there is any use whatsoever in seeing if they will replace them.  Additionally, that 10 year warranty that I was so excited about has an exclusion which I am sure they will claim this falls under - Defects caused by handling by third parties (such as airlines, hotels, etc);\n\nI am going to ask tor 2 wheels to see what the warranty response is like even though I will likely never trust these bags again.\n\nSO... unless you plan to put your bags on the plane yourself (the only way not to have this flaw fall inside that exclusion for the warranty), I would have to strongly advise against purchasing anything from this line of bags. The rest of the bag did not exhibit any flaws but trust me, loosing a wheel or having a wheel be shredded to where it now has a completely flat side makes the bag a purchase you would regret.\n\n*********************************************************\nOriginal Review - prior to the damage.\n*********************************************************\n\nThis is my second product from the Delsey family - the other is the&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Delsey-Luggage-Helium-Sky-2-0-3-Piece-Softside-Lugage-Set-21-34-25-34-29-34-Black/dp/B01FE2BXSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Delsey Luggage Helium Sky 2.0 3 Piece Softside Lugage Set 21\"/25\"/29\", Black</a>\n\nIn my opinion, the main areas of interest in luggage quality are the zippers, wheels, structural integrity of the frame & the fabric itself, and the handle. Other areas of note in considering a luggage purchase are the compartments, belt and clasp strength and bag weight.\n\nThese bags hit all the right points in what I look for in relation to quality, but the real assessment of how it performs would be in 3-4 years from now.\n\nPROS:\nLove how the handle has two positions to lock into giving two different lengths\nBags are lightweight despite its high quality components and build.\nReally high quality material used inside and out\nVery strong zipper\nSmooth rolling wheels. Just as good rolling on all four wheels or can be pulled on two.\nLots of compartments to allow for an abundant amount of organization on your travels,\nExpansion zips giving you a little more room for last minute items\n10 year warranty!!!!\n2 high quality bags with a ten year warranty at this price....\nCarry on is lightweight, rolls really smoothly, and is easy to carry\nBags look great, and easy to spot at baggage claim\n\nCONS:\nNone that I can see that should be considered as a reason to reconsider a purchase  .\n\nIn the absence of cons, there are points that I would add to a wish list\n#1 While better than the Helium Sky handle, I wish the handle had a slightly more solid feel.\n#2 I wish the wheels were a little more recessed in the case (like 50%) to avoid skipping on interior space\n\nFor the longest time, Delsey, has been a industry leader in the luggage market, and I'm delighted to have some bearing my name tag after years of cheaper offerings. I am leaving for Crete in 1 weeks and I am excited to take these Delseys on their first trip.  If there are major updates to this review from their adventures on the road - I'll add that information here.\n\nIn summary, if you are looking for a long term fling with a great travel companion who carries a 10 year pre-nup, this Delsey set is for you.", "summary": "Don't buy!
