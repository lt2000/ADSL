The colour of this two piece is a lovely dark blue, although it doesn't appear as dark as the photos. The fit is athletic, and the back straps provide great support without pinching. Despite this, the top may not do if you have a full bust. The swim bottom provides full coverage but seems somewhat small, fits tight, and hits at an odd place. Nonetheless, it doesn't feel as if you'll be exposed while you walk or bend over.  Note: there is a pleasant surprise, something not seen in the photo-- a greenish-teal and blue waist band-- very pretty! It would have been nice to have a little teal somewhere on the top, perhaps on the straps. Overall I like the two piece, it serves its lap, and fitness purpose and I'm keeping it.

That is one of the many reasons that I really like this awesome top.  It is flattering regardless of your figure, but especially if you tend to carry weight around your belly.  I had twins seven weeks ago, so I am finding that a lot of my tops look pretty awful right now.  That is not the case with this top! The flared bottom comes off your body just enough that it isn't clingy.  Yet it isn't so large that it looks like a maternity top.  It is a great length, even on someone as tall as me.  It adequately covers everything.  The scoop neck is very stylish and allows you to show some skin without being over the top. It is a thin material but not so thin that it ends up being see through.  The shirt washes well maintaining its  vibrant color. It is also really soft.  The only small down side to the top is that it does wrinkle.  Not an issue for normal everyday wear, but it is probably a shirt you don't want to pack for vacation.\nI received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion and review.", "summary": "Stylish and comfy", "unixReviewTime": 1441065600}

I am a plus sized girl with a X-shaped figure (small waist, equal shoulder and hip width), and the shape of this corset just worked for me.  My husband is a huge fan since it looks like lingerie, and I am a fan because I get a level of compression and shaping that cannot be seen under clothing (like any good shapewear should be!).\n\nI ordered an XL, but I am a good bit over the weight limit for that size, according to the company (5'6\", 220 lbs)--however, it still fit great and it doesn't seem to be tremendously stretched.  My body shape may have something to do with this (much of the weight I carry is distributed beyond what this corset covers), so I don't know how that knowledge will help others, but I would say that perhaps the weight limits in the sizing are a little more lenient than they are written.\n\nI love that this corset features multiple rows of hook and eye closures--I am in process of losing weight and look forward to being able to adjust this trainer as I go along.  The straps are also adjustable and can be removed or switched around as necessary if being worn under clothing--a nice bonus.\n\nMy only complaint is that as I wear it and move around, it seems to gather in the back just under my ribcage where my waist is smallest, and it creates a really tight place there which gets uncomfortable rather quickly.  If I am in a shirt, I can easily remedy this by pulling the material down and back into place, but if I was in a dress or other longer one-piece outfit, I would imagine it would require a few trips to the bathroom over the course of a meal or event in order to return the trainer to a less-painful position.  To be noted, waist trainers are not necessarily supposed to be used in this way (as general shapewear), but this piece is advertised as such, so I thought it might be worth the mention for those who intend to use it as shapewear.\n\nI received this corset at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review, and I am fairly pleased with it, love the way it looks, and think it is a great addition to my \"pretty underthings\" repertoire.", "summary": "Beautiful piece of shapewear... great fit!", "unixReviewTime": 1442361600}

The red is definitely more of a burgundy, but not quite a pink. These three bags are made of a rip stop nylon, similar to a very lightweight backpack material. I like that they are light and not bulky because traveling for a month you don't need more weight in your bag. There is a heavy weight zipper which is nice so they can actually be used for a long time. There is also a nice heavy clip, I am not sure if that is something that my husband will need however the clips are nice to have.\n\nThe material is water resistant, but I wouldn't say that it is water proof. These will be great to travel with cosmetics and those types of things that may leak, the fabric feels like it will really keep the leaks from escaping the bags, but they are washable which is obviously perfect for traveling.\n\nThere are three pouches, with measuring 9.5 x 7.5 inches, 7.5 x 5.5 inches, and 5.5 x 3.75 inches. The different sizes will really help my husband keep everything organized during his travels, and also while he is staying at a hotel for a month.\n\nI purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Great bags for travel", "unixReviewTime": 1459296000}

I had never thought of a packing organizer before, but I'm so glad I came across it.\n\nWhen you unfold the organizer, you'll see that It comes with a plastic chart showing how to fold the clothing, and that can be removed for washing the product. The clothing is folded and placed in the center of the open organizer. I was able to fit 8 short sleeved shirts easily and could probably go as high as 8 or 10, although the amount may vary if you're packing thicker items. The sides of the organizer are then folded around the clothing, making for a compact and easily packable package for the suitcase.\n\nPros include: *The item is washable which is plus, as a surprising number of organizers I looked into are not.\n*It's very lightweight so it won't much affect the poundage, which is important when flying\n*The size would work well to keep items compact, and would be perfect for using in a carry-on bag\n*I like that it will keep items wrinkle free. This would come in handy when packing dress shirts for a business trip\n*The idea in an of itself is wonderful; so many times I have packed for trips and items ended up all over the suitcase\n*When not traveling this would work great as a closet organizer, storing off season items\n*I personally did not find the item too small, it will fit the shirts I need for traveling, and I would purchase a second one for pants\n\nCons: The only slight improvement I could see being made is the organizer having a front and back stiff panel, as opposed to just the one in the back. When I pick the item up by the handle the clothing hangs toward the bottom a bit. But I really don't foresee the need to use the handle, as I will be picking the whole thing up when packing.\n\nOverall, I am happy with the product and will continue to use it for future travels.", "summary": "Great way to keep travel organized!", "unixReviewTime": 1465603200}

The small pouch on the right closes with a zipper, and on the front of that pouch is a smaller pouch that is a bit difficult to see at first because of how the top folds over it.\n\nThe bottom of the bag has a padded rectangle sewn into it to add some extra strength and durability to the bag. It's a nice feature, but I wish it was a bit larger. The main compartment is huge. I can keep my wallet, a changing pad with diapers, a book, an iPad Mini, my wallet, my keys, and a few snacks just in the main compartment and without forcing it all to fit. The bag can hold a lot more once you start filling up the smaller pockets too.\n\nThis also comes with a little soft elephant charm that is adorable.

It is quite possible that it states somewhere that it will take some time before arrival, but I had not anticipated on it taking so long to arrive. When it arrived here, it was neatly packaged in such a way that the tie wasn't wrinkled when I opened the package. The tie is a vibrant red and even over all the fabric. It isn't silky or shimmery, it is just basic red. The tie is thick in material or so it seems, meaning I don't feel like the tie is flimsy, it feels durable and long lasting. I especially like this tie because it is long and the balance of the entire tie, to the wider part and the thinner part, are proportioned in such a way that it will balance out once the tie has been put on. With the lengthy tie it also allows for the use of creative tying without feeling like one was going to run out of what is left of the tie. The lining of the tie is black material and the stitching is nicely done, the point on the tie is perfect as well, there doesn't seem to be any miscalculations in the making of this tie that it all is proportioned as it should be.

Just the right size and shape for tossing in all that you need, then finding it when you need it.  In other words, the inside compartments--one main large compartment, one for a phone, one to keep several small items together, and one zippered pouch--are all easily accessible, with a long zippered top opening and not-too-deep inside.  Perfect for my needs.  There is a zippered wide pocket on the outside, too.\n\nThere is a detachable long strap that can turn the bag in a shoulder carry or across the chest carry.  Two other short strap handles prevent the bag from dragging, and allows you to keep it close to you.\n\nIt is not a \"formed\" bag and does not have much structure.  But it is shaped nicely, and with your larger items stored at the bottom, this bag will stand on its own.  There are also two snap button long tabs on each side to help shore up the top sides so they do not gap.  If you need a bit of extra room, just un-snap the tabs and let the bag fall free.\n\nI really like the material.  It is nylon, but a heavy, matte nylon--definitely not thin parachute material.  (Although the inside lining is much like parachute material, maybe a touch thicker.)  The material is very nice looking, as are the contrasting colors inside and out.  And the cute hand-made, hand-stitched stuffed elephant on the outside zipper pull is darling and adds something to the overall look.\n\nBag is well-constructed, with straight seams and stitching.  Stitching is all finished off nicely.  Metal hardware is decent and does not clank around.  Main zipper has large plastic--not metal--teeth.\n\n*I received a free sample product from Oiwas.", "summary": "Love the strong, medium-weight matte nylon material; shape is great--not too deep, but long and opens wide", "unixReviewTime": 1441497600}

It comes with a strap that also allows you to carry it on your shoulder or as a cross-body bag, and it does holds a decent amount of 'stuff' for its size. Every day casual use.... and I like it.\n\nThe purse we received is about 15.5 inches across (side to side), 9 inches tall (top to bottom, excluding the handles or the strap's length) and the soft base is about 4.5 inches wide when laid flat. While not made to readily stand on its own, the construction seems very well done. I like the textured feel; the inside is nicely lined with a rose colored polyester lining, and the stitching seems well done all around.\n\nThe zippers used on the top closure and the exterior front pocket are nice and heavy duty metal zippers, while the zipper used on the interior pocket is a lighter weight nylon zipper. None of the zippers show signs of issues or stress.\n\nThis hand bad is comprised of one lined, main compartment, with measurement close to those of the bag's exterior (as noted above). There interior zippered pocket along the inside of the back wall is made to hold lipstick and keys, and is about 7 inches wide by 2 inches deep. There are two slip-in pockets on the opposite interior wall; one if 2.5 inches wide and the other 4 inches wide, and both are about 4.5 inches deep.  Between those slip-in pockets are two slip-in pen/pencil slots.\n\nThe previously mentioned zippered exterior pocket is about 8 inches wide by 5 inches deep. Overall, this handbag seems to be nicely styled and well made and the retail tag on the bag notes that it is covered by a 1 year warranty.\n\nIf you are looking for a purse of this style, size, price, color and construction, for use as I have described above, then I would recommend giving this Oiwas handbag a try based on my experience with it.\n\nRecommended.\n\nGo for it.\n\nWe received this item gratis from the seller, without obligation, and decided to objectively test and review it.

I really like my TYR trunks, but at $25-$30 a pair, they're a bit on the pricey side to essentially be used as underwear, so I decided to try some cheaper options.\n\nThese fit, but aren't super comfortable. There's no room up front for the goods, so they feel a bit restricted. I'm not exactly Ron Jeremy in that department, so it's not like I'm asking these shorts to accommodate anything more than average. They also Ken doll what you do have, so if you're wanting to show off, look elsewhere, though if you are particularly modest, these may be the route to go. They fit my waist, despite my belly's growing efforts, but cut into my thighs a bit. I have some serious quads from biking for years, so that may be some of it, but it's worth noting my TYR's don't cut in at all.\n\nThe fabric isn't terribly abrasion resistant. You can tell where some of my shorts have seams because they've rubbed against these trunks and pilled them. The pilling is lighter in color, so it's fairly obvious that something is off from quite a distance. They haven't faded much, though I most of their time in the water is in salt water, so I can't really comment on their chlorine resistance.\n\nThere is a liner, and while it's not terrible (doesn't itch, doesn't hold excessive amounts of water), it covers most of the front of these, (from waistband to leg stitching, starting at the front of the thighs) and occasionally causes the leg portion to shift around in weird ways.\n\nThe stitching seemed fine at first, but I'm getting stray threads here and there, and I know I'll be at them with a needle and thread soon.\n\nFor the money, they're not bad, but I need a bit more out of trunks and will probably bite the bullet and invest in more TYRs. I'll continue to wear these when my nicer trunks are in the laundry, but I have a feeling their life will be short, and I'm ok with that. Once they area gone I won't be buying any more pairs.", "summary": "I really like my TYR trunks", "unixReviewTime": 1473033600}

I was able to tighten them up pretty easily, but for those of you who don't do anything by means of alterations you should be aware that the hems of the sleeves, collar, and bottom of the shirt are not very snugly stitched and will likely come unravelled easily. It was also not a very comfortable material overall- it almost reminded me of a halloween costume, although not quite to that extent. You know how costumes tend to be a bit rigid, and smooth but not really soft? That's what this reminded me of.  The colors were similar to the top in the picture, but I highly doubt that the pictured shirt is the same brand that I recieved- the one in the picture is clearly of a higher quality. But in the end, it's decent enough for being so cheap of a price.

The fit is amazing. I was careful to order according to the manufacturers sizing and am so happy I did! I do have to make one adjustment and increase the arm hole size by reseaming the shoulder seams. Thankfully, the manufacturer actually left enough seam allowance (which is very rare nowadays) for custom tailoring if needed. I am happy with the fabric as well. The print is great and fabric feels good on, and seems to have a little stretch. I have purchased a petticoat since I am going for the full skirt look. I am pleasantly surprised by the lack of show through and don't think I will need to wear a slip to hide my bra, despite having ordered the white cherry pattern.\n\nI do wish there was a coordinating button up, cropped sweater I could buy to wear with this dress from the same company to complete my '50's look!

Sometimes you have to worry about canvas bags being too rigid when you first get them, this one is very pliable and has a broken in feel.  As other comments have noted, there is no structure for laptops, so it's buyer beware if you're using this as a laptop bag.  My only real complaint is that there is no handle on the top of the bag, this sounds petty, but picking it up by the shoulder strap or just grabbing a handful of the bag is annoying.

I ruled out the gold immediately since I generally prefer silver and platinum.\n\nThe antique and dark versions are exactly the same, only with varying levels of oxidation. I would have really loved the antique one with absolutely no oxidation at all - Say, a simple polished silver. The reason I'm not a fan of the oxidation is because it gives it a pewter like finish, and I would much rather tarnish the silver on my own.\n\nSo that left me with the shiny one, which is rhodium plated. After contacting the manufacturer, I found out that there is no nickel between the silver and the rhodium - Which made me really excited! If you know anything about rhodium, you'll know that it does wear off with time, but keeps your ring shiny for as long as possible. But if there's nickel underneath the rhodium, well, that usually doesn't look so good. In this case there isn't, so as the rhodium wears off, it will start to tarnish and spot in a more natural way, ultimately becoming the antique version. I knew right away this is what I wanted, and I am not disappointed! Keep in mind, it may take literal years for rhodium plating to wear off. It's generally quite durable, being a type of platinum, making your jewelry almost look like white gold. (In fact, most white gold is plated with rhodium.)\n\nThe ring itself is very attractive, and VERY comfortable to wear. I could wear it all day without it bothering me, and that's a huge plus. Adjusting it to your preferred size is a breeze. There's also no mistake of what it is - Everyone who has seen it has complimented it right away, being able to tell that it was an aquatic tentacle design. I couldn't be more excited. Each 'sucker' on the tentacle is well defined, and nothing feels smudged or podged together. It's very well made with good detail definition!\n\nWhile I received this item at a discount for my honest review, I'm extremely excited about it. This is easily my favorite, if not best, piece of jewelry in my collection. Also, don't be afraid of contacting the manufacturer - They're very responsive and helpful!", "summary": "I've never been so proud to show off my love for tentacle based hentai", "unixReviewTime": 1459900800}

I had to use one of my switchblades to get the dirt out.\nThe design on the outer part, on a close up inspection, looks as if someone spray painted the black paint on it, and it is beginning to face with me messing around with it.\n\nAll in all, I do like this necklace, but probably not enough to pay $20 for it.

There is no way this dress would fit me.  It did however fit my 12 year old daughter.  I will have to hem the bottom because it is too long on her.  If you order I suggest a couple sizes smaller.  Another problem with the dress is the bodice is not lined and you can clearly see your bra through the dress.  We fixed this problem by having her wear a shirt underneath the dress.  You will also need a slip because your underwear will also be visible if you don't, however I didn't find that a problem.  The dress had a few wrinkles when I got it and they ironed out very easily.  The fabric is a soft silky fabric it is very light weight and works very well as a summer dress.  I did give it four stars because my daughter loves the print on the dress and it will work perfectly for her with some minor modifications like a slip and undershirt.  I liked that it had cap sleeves, was modest, and my daughter said it was comfortable to wear.  I received this dress at a discounted price in exchange for my honest unbiased review.

I purchased a large because everyone said it was so small, and it fit perfectly (I normally wear a small women's or medium juniors... 34B bust). Unfortunately, though, there are no holes for the buttons! Even the pockets with the flap that covers a button (so clearly it was not a fashion choice to make them un-buttonable) did not have holes for the buttons. There was stitching for them, but no cut...very strange. Material is not bad...needs to be ironed before wearing, but farily comfortable. A little stiff, but soft enough...maybe a wash would help. All in all, the color and the fact that there are no button holes made this a bad-buy for me.

After you unwrap the face of the watch, there is another piece of plastic on the back of the watch!!!\n\nThis watch is beautiful. It keeps excellent time. It hasn't ran fast or slow. I'm hoping that it doesn't start doing that because so far I am impressed with how well it keeps times. You definitely have to wear it the majority of the day or it will stop, before you wind it again in the morning. When you wind it each morning, wind it clockwise .. which should be going in the direction away from you .. if you're holding the watch face up in the palm of you hand. After you wind it, MAKE SURE, that you repeat the step of holding it and swinging you arms 45 times .. this will help it stay wound for the rest of the day while you wear it. If your watch is like the one that I received, you have to set it counter clockwise. You can turn it the other way but it will turn the hands backwards, which I don't think makes a difference, but just to make sure I set it with the hands going clockwise.\n\nThe first day, I wound it, set it .. held it face and swung my arm 45 times and it lasted until the next day.  I didn't wind it in the morning, the second day that I had it  .. so it stopped the following morning. It comes with an instruction booklet, a nationwide warranty and thank you card, and a KS tag in a nice box. If I know that I have to take it off for any reason, then I swing it the 45 times once .. sometimes twice depending on how long I plan on keeping it off.\n\nI'm giving it 5 stars because it is a beautiful watch, and it works very well if you follow the instructions as closely as you possibly can.", "summary": "Make sure that you take off all of the plastic or it will not start!!", "unixReviewTime": 1442448000}

In the Spring, it could be hot in some regions since it is long sleeved and black; it can be a bit hot on warmer days.

So after having lived in Switzerland for 5 years and knowing about 0.3% of what there is to know about the Swiss watch industry, I'll get to the point:  This is a nice piece, and the price is about what the battery replacement costs on a luxury brand.  I just set the date, and there is a very precise and instant response to the crown that motivated me to share.  So don't be fooled by the price, the Swiss CAN crank out a very nice, accurate timepiece that holds up, looks good, and impressively, feels very very high quality... at a very affordable price.  It looks nice, with very crisp numerals and indicator hands, and good proportions to my taste.  It has the basic features of a chronometer, very directly accessible and useable -- no perpetual calendar and other \"grande complications\", but it rewards, as noted, with pleasant, nearly instant setting of the date and nice feel to the operation.  Some compromises: The glass is mineral, so it likely won't resist scratching to quite the same degree as sapphire glass on expensive models, but 2 months in (and a few direct hits later -- remodeling), there is zero scratching.  The chrono second hand is a little hard to see, but you quickly figure out how to deal with it.  It is also a little heavy, but that comes with the chronometer package.  I find it is safer to take it off for some sports like skiing and ice skating, I fell one time and the watch slid into my wrist joint, painful.  Other than those minor quibbles, it's a solid, very rewarding piece.  Battery is user-changeable, so you can likely expect very little expense in the long term to keep the piece running.  I like it.", "summary": "A lot of Swiss for a very very reasonable price.", "unixReviewTime": 1456790400}

If I can make a suggestion to the seller, I would ask them to photograph it on a couple of different color backgrounds so that it's clear there is no white in it. It's light enough and won't tangle because it's actually made of 5 bigger blocks, not separate black pieces chained together.

I work in construction, and have been notoriously hard on my wedding bands.\nI started with gold bands, and literally broke a couple of them (and I mean broke, clean through), they were sold for their gold weight. I then went for years without a wedding band (apologies to my wife). Then titanium rings came on the market. I bought one, and pretty much destroyed it in two weeks. It didn't break, but it looked awful. Again I went without for a couple of years. Now these tungsten carbide rings have come around. After the years that I have spent in construction, I have learned some things about metallurgy, and was intrigued.\nI thought I would give it a try.\nNow to the ring.\nOkay, first of all, this thing is a beast. The first thing you will notice is the weight. It feels substantial (like gold). The next thing you'll notice is the feel, it is smooth!!! This ring has held up to my rough treatment phenomenally well. On close inspection, I can't see a scratch on it.\nIf you live a rough, and active lifestyle, I would highly recommend this ring. One bit of advice, this was the first comfort fit band I have bought, and I think because of the smooth rounded surfaces, it felt loose. After a couple of tries I ended up with a size 11 ring, whereas my previous non-comfort fit ring was a size 12... Not to worry, the return and exchange process is simple, and I ended up with a ring that fits perfectly. I love this ring, and my wife liked it enough, that she asked me to order one for her as well.", "summary": "Indestructible but beautiful", "unixReviewTime": 1489536000}

I recently got frostnip on a hiking trip (too much time with my heavy gloves off, messing around with my camera and tripod in sub-zero temperatures) and wanted to beef up my glove/liner game both to protect my fingers as they heal and to prevent something like that from happening again. My research indicated that these were possibly the warmest glove liners money could buy.\n\nFirst off, these are definitely warmer glove liners than the Smartwools. Im not sure though if thats because they're buffalo down instead of merino, or simply because they are a noticeably bulkier knit. They are definitely thicker, and I think that has more to do with their warmth than the fancy material.\n\nHowever, they are not as well made as the Smartwools. They aren't badly made by any means, but where Smartwools liners cling to my hands perfectly and preserve almost all of my dexterity, these are a bit saggier and the fingertips are a bit lumpier. Theyre not bad, just not quite as good. They also don't have touchscreen-compatible fingertips, which the Smartwools do. Note that the Smartwools are $25 whereas these cost $95. I get that bison down is inherently expensive, but if Im paying $95 for a knit glove I expect the construction to be excellent, not just good.\n\nAlso, they run a bit large. Experience has taught me time and time again that I need a mens medium when Im buying gloves. These are more like size large, meaning that they're a little bit baggy. If I were to order these again (which I wont, as I don't think they're worth the cost) Id order them in a size small.", "summary": "Good, but not $100 good.", "unixReviewTime": 1517011200}

The hem hit a couple of inches above the knee, the sleeves hit a couple of inches above the elbow.  I didn't even know it had a zipper until i took it off.  I just pulled it over my head and slid it down.  I did hand sew one stitch to hold the cleavage area together, which isn't unheard of for us 38B-C gals.  It took less than 5 minutes of steaming, out of the package, to remove any wrinkles.

I also had not noticed the word \"marled\" and thought the picture was showing the gray color, not the navy.  Marled means \"mottled or streaked\" and indeed this is a mottled navy and gray, rather an attractive look if you are not looking for solid navy.  The fabric was quite nice, a little stretchy and fairly thick.  It looked like it would keep its shape through many washings if washed inside out in cold water as they suggest.  I'm sorry it didn't work out because it was quite comfortable and well-made.  So the fault is really with the person ordering, not the product.

My 4 year old daughter wanted some new summer-weight astronaut pajamas so we hopped on Amazon together and searched for astronaut pajamas.

She was so mad and disappointed that I couldn't find any girls astronaut pajamas. Anyway, when they arrived for my son two days later, I was pretty mad that I didn't get what was advertised.

I don't know - I'm not a man so I have no idea how these things works, I just figured there had to be some difference because otherwise wouldn't it just say \"Baby 2015 Footed Sleeper Pajama\"? Since these pajamas were clearly NOT BOYS' pajamas, I gave them to my daughter instead. (Incidentally, she informed me that half of NASA's astronaut latest class is 50% female.)\n\nThese are in fact lightweight - perfect for summer. They seem to run somewhat small - I thought they'd be a little big on her but instead I think she'll outgrow them in a couple months. Smaller than Carter's PJs.

I was not looking to spend more than $50 at Victoria's Secret (i buy most of my bikinos there; so yeah i am kind of picky) so i said \"why not amazon?\".

It does run really small im 5'4 and weigh about 130lbs and I ordered a size L.\nThe material is the same as the ones you get at Victoria's and it just makes me look fit which is weird because i just ate.\nAnyways i uploaded some pictures.\nPLEASE ignore my back. I had some acupuncture and cupping done because I injured my neck.\nHope this review helps you a lot more to make your decision. Unlike my other review, If you have big boobs i recommend this piece because it has more support to the sides and by support i mean more fabric!\nUnlike the other swimsuit, this one it's padded but it doesn't lift them up.\nI swear i was about to buy the same item but different color but they only have black.\nYou won't regret it!!

The robe looks like the picture, which is often not the case.\n2. It has pockets which took me a little while to find, but they're there.\n3. While it isn't super soft, it is comfortable. I'm sure that it'll get softer and softer the more it's washed.\n4. It has a small loop that can be used to hang on a hook.\n5. It doesn't shrink much, even after being washed in warm water and dried on the \"cotton\" setting.\n6. It's a good weight--not too heavy, but not too light, either.\n\nCons:\n\n1. It runs big. I'm a plus-sized woman, and the robe wraps around me to the extent that the left pocket is almost completely hidden. I think this robe would probably fit a 20-22 well as long as one doesn't have huge arms.\n2. It doesn't have an inside tie. I've gotten used to having that on other robes, and I kind of miss having one here.\n\nOverall, I'm happy with this robe because it's pretty, and it's comfortable.

It seemed thinner than the cotton used in the two piece pajama sets and I was worried it would develop holes. Well, they have. We haven't had them all that long and there is already a hole in the bottom of one of the feet and another hole starting where the zipper cover flap attaches. If they had been a thicker fabric I think they might be more durable and I would have given 5 stars.

I don't think I would buy anything orange from this company again fearing the color may not be what I want, but I would absolutely buy this tank top again because it is very well made and very comfortable just need a different color is all. I received this tank top at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "comfy clothes", "unixReviewTime": 1468108800}

I may order another pair of gray pants because I really do love them so much. If I were to order the black ones again, though, I'd go up to a size Medium -- which is unprecedented for me. Because I'm petite and have a literally child-sized torso, smalls are often too large for me.

The necklace looks exactly as it does in the picture. The crystals are so cute and colorful and look great with so many different outfits. I was thinking it would be too fragile, but after wearing it for a couple hours, it feels fine. It can be cold when I first put it on, but that's normal with metals. The metal also doesn't irritate my skin in any way, which is a big plus for me. For me the price was perfect. It was fairly cheap compared to other necklaces I've bought in the past. It is of good quality and I have no doubt that it will last me for a long time. The colors are really easy to match with multiple other colors. So far I've worn this necklace with blues, yellows, whites, blacks, greens, and even purples and it still all looked great!\n\nI also love that it came with a little bag. It helps for when I want to put up the necklace and make sure it doesn't get tangled with my other jewelry. I just slip it in the bag and have no fears!\nAll in all, I love this necklace!

The outside zipper and flap pockets allow for storage of my phones or tablet for easy access.\nI would recommend this bag to anyone who is interested in trying a messenger bag, to the more experienced messenger bag owners. The material is durable and provides high end look. I am very happy with the comfort, storage, and appearance of this bag.\nI received this bag at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Combines comfort, functionality, and style", "unixReviewTime": 1457395200}

One of the dresses I brought was for the night out of town!  It was very dressy and had very skinny halter like straps.

Summers", "reviewText": "When I saw this item online I thought it would be a great gift for my daughter who is a lifeguard and teaches swimming lessons.  She needed a hat that would protect her from the brutal Arizona sun but she wanted something stylish that would keep the kids focused on the instructor.  You never know whether an item will fit or if the description and picture would be accurate.  I debated whether to buy it since the last thing I wanted was the hassle of sending it back if it did not work.  My fears were unfounded.  The item arrived very quickly and was carefully packaged to protect the contents.  I have to admit, I didn't expect it to arrive in a box surrounded by packing.  I was anticipating it being shoved in an envelope to be trampled on by the shipping company.  Instead it was perfect and still had the form from the pictures on the item.\n\nItems like this are mostly designed for children so I was nervous whether this would fit an adult.  I was shocked to find that it was as described and with my wife and my daughter.  The one negative of this is that now my wife wants a cute hat like this too so my testing kind of backfired as it will result in another order.\n\nThe hat was very well received and my daughter was excited to have something cute to wear during her next set of swim lessons.  Thanks for making this product available and for helping me solidify the Dad of the Year nomination.\n\nTo sum up: outstanding product that was an amazing gift for my daughter.  It arrived quickly, was carefully packaged, and it fit perfectly.  Couldn't ask for anything better.", "summary": "Exactly what was described.", "unixReviewTime": 1467072000}

The following review is my honest and unbiased opinion:\n\nFirst of all, let's set one thing straight: This is not a \"punk rock\" bracelet. Punk is all about studs and spikes. This is a weave with skull iconography, thus making it fall into the categories of \"biker bracelet\" or \"hard core bracelet.\"\n\nDefinitions aside, it's pretty sweet. Note that the bracelet itself is made of tight leather weave. The metal ornaments spin around but are held in place (pretty well) with rubber gaskets. The clasp, as I show in my pics, is around back and consists of a strong magnetic closure. So unlike those bracelets that make the rest of your biker gang wait around while you're struggling to put them on, this one closes up magnetically in a snap. It's a solid piece of ornamentation with a whole lot of macho thrown in.", "summary": "Magnetic Clasp Won't Make Your Biker Gang Wait As You Put It On", "unixReviewTime": 1446681600}

The price for a leather strap was $25-30, so I looked at some recommendations and saw these EazyBelt offerings. I ordered this and a saddle brown belt, because I figured for $19 I couldn't not try these out when they include a buckle. The leather is bit shinier than I'd like, but seems very decent for the price and the buckle works quite differently than the SlideBelt. A little lever must be actuated on the bottom edge of the buckle in order to release the belt. In some cases you must push in toward the buckle with the belt ot make this work, but it's just a matter of getting used to it.\n\nThe buckle is quite handsome, and quite heavy.

I have had a lot of medical issues over the years which have had me not wearing any skirts or dresses in years. I wear knee high support stockings and don't want them showing because I'm self conscious with it. This skirt in the picture shown on ad, shows the skirt at about a 3/4 length. Not sure if it's due to the size I ordered (3XL) or what but I'm 5'7\" tall and this skirt pretty much comes down to my ankles which honestly, is perfect for me and I love it. It covers my stockings so you cannot even see them. I wear an 18 in pants and would normally do a 2X, but I went a size up with this and glad I did.\n\nThe skirt itself I love!! The material is very nice and the pleats are small all around which makes it so pretty. I love the lace addition on the bottom of it and it has a scalloped  hem. The waist is elastic and fit me well. There is a built in slip that covers the necessary top half and that part comes mid way down my thighs. Material is sheer but the slip covers what it needs to so mainly just the bottom ends up being see through. All the stitching on the skirt is done very well and there were no loose threads.\n\nI'm not one for hand washing things which this recommends. I personally placed mine in a delicates bag and put in the washer and then hung to dry and it came out fine. Overall, I am super happy with this skirt and cannot wait to wear it again. Finally I have a skirt I can wear and feel comfortable in.\n**I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

Black tie tradituonally calls for a formal length gown but I chose to go short. I bought a size 8 in this dress and it fit me like a glove. My dress looked just like the picture and I did not even have to steam it out the bag. I do acknowledge what the other reviewers said about the awkward cup placement sewn inside the bodice of the dress. Since the cups are not sewn indivudually into place, but rather seem to be placed into a sewn upper pocket of the bodice, it does make it easy for them to shift which can be an issue if you're particularly busty or on the opposite end of the spectrum if you're particularly modest in the chest area. This was not my experience though.\n\nSizing:\nThe dress does seem to run small so I recommend purchasing a size up, which is why I went with the 8.\n\nAccessories:\nAlso beware of your accessories! This dress is heavily designed with lace so be careful with necklaces, rings, bracelets  or handbags that could get caught in the lace and snag the dress with the slightest brush. In my opinion you do not need a necklace, it takes away from the beauty of the neckline.\n\nWeight:\nLastly, some commented on the weight of dress. The dress does have a satin slip with like a built in petticoat which contributes to the fan out look of the skirt. I found it to be fairly comfortable and just right, not too heavy. I could still move about freely.", "summary": "Perfect Fit and Classy Look for Black Tie Affair", "unixReviewTime": 1466294400}

When I go shopping I don't like to carry my big purse around thru a mall or in the stores... so I have been looking for a long time for something that is light weight, can be worn on the shoulder or across the shoulder and carry my phone, ID  and debit card.  And this is it.. totally perfect for me.\n\nIt is small and thin (which I love) and because you cant put a lot of things into it.. it is very lightweight.\n\nToday I went to the casino for breakfast and was so happy to be able to use this..for it left my hands free but was not big and clumsy and my old shoulder purse would be bumping into things.  The strap is long so you can wear it as a shoulder bag or a crossover.  If using as a shoulder bag the bag settles  in around my hip area.... easy and convenient to reach but also out of our way.\n\nI have a iphone 6s with a bulky otter case and it fit nicely into the bag with room to spare for cash or ID or charge/debit cards. I also tried out the Galaxy S5 Active phone and it fit in nicely also.\n\nPros:  Small, lightweight, shoulder bag or crossover bag, perfect size for my cell  phone and for what I wanted it for\nCons:  It might be to small for some people..\n\nI am totally happy with this purse and though I have not had it long enough to write about durability.. for right now I give it a total thumbs up.  I always update my reviews over time if I discover I need to add something to this review, so if I discover any negatives or even more positives I will update here.\n\nI was given the opportunity to purchase this purse at a discounted rate in exchange evaluating and using the purse and writing a review.  I take all my reviews very seriously and try to reflect pro and con in each review.  I have included some photos of my \"now favorite purse\" .. and I hope you found this review to be helpful to you.", "summary": "Small  and is exactly what I wanted...", "unixReviewTime": 1449532800}

It fits my iPhone 6 (in TPU case) well along with the other items pictured. My car keys are a bit of a squeeze but they still fit with everything. Mostly I wanted it as a pocket replacement, since so many of my clothes don't have pockets big enough for my phone and if I leave it laying around the house my toddler takes it. The interior has a suede like material to protect against scratches which is also really nice. There are 2 equal sized pockets on the inside and the clip on front works well. The whole thing looks well made, although there is a bit of a chemical odor that I expect will go away as I air it out. One other thing to note, my husbands 5.5\" phone barely fit on its own in the purse so if you have a large phone like that you probably want a slightly bigger purse.\nDisclaimer: I purchased this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.", "summary": "Great small purse for phone and a few other small items", "unixReviewTime": 1448236800}
