My tee shirt size is Ex-Small, and when I was a small, I was only a size 4. I  don't love all the colors.  But, out of the color options they were kinda my favorite initially. But there my casual bras, so! Who really cares about that, right? Plus, it's made for women with less of a breast gap ( which is most women) . However, do to the very stretchy material  I can make the cups space in between them wider fitting (buy stretching that area between them for atleast 90 seconds  to a couple mins buy pulling away from each other before putting it on each time).  The quality is VERY good and the rest of it fits perfectly. However, I ordered a medium and and am a 32C size.  Which is the smallest for that size range. I would think if your on the large end of a size range you should size up a size. And go to the Genie Bra size chart ( google it online) before ordering. To get the right size.  These bras are NOT for heavy sports bra use. But, with the removable cup inserts in, and the right size, It defiantly provides, light to moderate support even when exercising. For women without very large breasts. If you have very large breasts Im not sure if you should exercise in it. But, the right size should fit you for other non dressy occasions (obviously). They will keep you very cool and are very comfortable. There great for sleeping in. And terrible for low neck tees or blouses.\n\n  These statements are made only keeping the inserts in the bra cups in. Taking them out will show your nipples and make alot of the above not true.\n\n  The price is awesome for the quality of these.\n\nI hope this helps.", "summary": "Please read my details first.", "unixReviewTime": 1410652800}

Honestly, the shirt is without an hour-glass shape, but hangs straight down on the sides.  (I'd specifically chosen this shirt because the photo of it, at first glance, makes it look hour-glass and very fitted--so I'm quite disappointed regarding that.  Now that I look closer at the photo, it looks as though the model had to pinch the front and the back of the shirt to give  it an contouring.  The sleeves were pleated at the top, giving it a \"slight\" Victorian-poof look (that part I like).  But sadly the sleeves also hang half-way down the length of my hand, so I'm going to have to add two lengthwise strips of elastic to the outer side of EACH sleeve (above the buttons) to bring it to the 3/4\" length that the model is showing. ---- I think this blouse will look CUTE ENOUGH AFTER I GET ALL THE SEWING ADJUSTMENTS DONE, after which it'll end up having vintage waist-contouring and sleeves by the time I'm done with it.", "summary": "The shirt that arrived and that I tried on seemed like a very loose fitting X-LARGE size", "unixReviewTime": 1448409600}

My bust is almost 41\", my hips 36\". The batwing sleeves give extra room for large busts & allows me to go down a size. The medium fits me perfect & is so slimming. This is one of the few tops on the market which is made for top heavy women like me (natural DD). I just got to watch my belly fat in this. This is dressier than sweatshirts, not too thick or bulky, longer & still very comfortable. The fabric is good quality, not thin or see-through in any way unlike other brand's cheap tops here on amazon (like Leggings Queen or Clothes Effect). The navy blue does look good with jeggings or jeans. Update: I bought the pink in a large (not available in med for Prime) & added the stats. It is still slimming, but looser-fitting with extra room, great if you have a bit of a belly or like shirts slightly oversized. I now know why some say it looks like a sweatshirt. The pink is not a solid color like the navy, but is \"heather\", making it look more casual & weathered- still looks better than a sweatshirt or plain t-shirt. The neckline is way too wide, but I knew that from the picture. My lazy quick fix for many of my tops is to fold the fabric over on itself at the back of the neck & pin it with 2 safety pins, making the opening smaller so my bra straps do not show. My long hair covers that area. But the opening on this one is so big, I just might have to take it in on each side. I hate sewing but good quality, slimming tops made for people with smaller hips are hard to find. I do wish they made these in more colors (not heather) & that the neckline was smaller.  Sorry, I guess I am old school & do not believe that showing bra straps are sexy, only tacky & low class. My only other complaint is that not all colors & sizes are available with 2 day prime shipping. I have never been unsatisfied with the quality of Allegra K's tops. They all seem very well-made with good quality fabric. Never see-through or falling apart. Allegra K: thanks for the batwing tops! Please make more styles & colors, especially for this summer!", "summary": "PERFECT FOR LG BUST, SM HIPS!", "unixReviewTime": 1455667200}

Not sure if it's heat related or what the reason might be, but a few days ago, I noticed there were blemishes on the the material of the temples. I thought the frame was melting or something. Well, turns out there is a film coating the resin frame, lending the glasses their really cool color. Somehow, for some unknown reason, the coating on my frames bubbled up and started peeling off. Now, I don't mind this so much, because these are not my particularly valuable accessories. But I am surprised it happened.

Umbreon is cool.\n\nWHAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO KNOW\n This hat is surprisingly well made given the price.\n It is actually lined.  The interior has a black fabric inside that was hastily sewn. Ours came with a spot where the stitching wasn't complete, and a place where the seem was caught up in the stitching, but overall these flaws don't effect the wearability.\n\n The outside fabric is a thick black velour.\n The eyes are red with black pupils and a white dot of 'eye shine'.  I would say that they are prefabricated and sewn onto the velour.  Ours was extremely well sewn.  Very nice work.\n The yellow 'O' between the eyes is similarly sewn on, although the fabric is ever-so-slightly fuzzy.\n The only other adornment are the yellow stripes on the ears.  These are fuzzy and are made of additional fabric.\n The ears tend to flop backwards. You can send them forwards with a tilt of the head. If you want them to stand up you are going to have to add some structure.\n\n There are no cleaning instructions or fabric content labels on the hat.  Perhaps there was in the plastic bag. My son opened the package so there's no telling where any documentation went to.\n\n IMPORTANT to know is that this hat is HUGE. I have a large head and there was room to spare.  Not much, but it dropped down all the way over my head.\n There is no scent.\n\nSUMMARY\nOverall this is very good hat for $7 bucks. Ours had a couple of minor errors in the stitching of the lining, but that could be a fluke. It certainly didn't effect my ability to wear the hat. Which I did for Halloween.\n\nThe outside of the hat is very well done.  The main downside of this hat for most people is that it is adult sized.\n\nIf you are going to give this as a gift I suggest you get some colorful tissue paper and a gift bag/box, because it comes in a plain plastic bag.\n\nCute!", "summary": "NOT Child Sized", "unixReviewTime": 1414713600}

But there are definitely some flaws:\n\n1. The gasket ring is a little too deep for my tastes. I had a lobe swell up (allergies + a recent stretch), and the swelling pulled the flare into my ear instead of popping off the gasket. This can also cause issues with the fistula getting snagged while inserting the tunnels just after stretching. Given that wearing tapers is unhealthy for your lobes, and pushing these tunnels through immediately after stretching can be difficult, there is an obvious problem.\n\n2. The tunnels are a hair short. Healthy, thick lobes don't have a lot of room - Especially if they swell.\n\n3. On the smaller sizes, the flare is not big enough, and is sloped in a way that can easily stretch your lobe if there is pressure. It shouldn't be a gradual slope, it should be pretty immediate (closer to a 90 degree flare, rather than a perfect curve).\n\n4. The gaskets are not sized for the jewelry. A couple sizes seem to share the same gaskets, so some are tight, hard to put on, and others are loose. Not a big deal, but aggravating when you lose gaskets, or have difficulties putting them on.\n\n5. As the taper size increases, so does the angle of the taper. At 8mm, the angle was too sharp for my tastes. I could feel the taper pushing the fistula out towards the back of my lobe rather than slowly sliding it open. This is not OK at all. I could easily see this causing a blowout. There is no reason for the tapers to have different angles. These tapers are already pretty short, and they stay the same length. But it is totally possible to ball the end instead of point it, and keep a constant angle and length. Theoretically, the taper could start at the previous thickness and end at the new thickness, rather than starting at a point and ending at the new thickness.\n\n6. It is mimicking the gauge system, where 2ga to 0ga and 0ga to 00ga are both closer to 2mm than 1mm stretches. This takes it a step further and goes from 6mm to 8mm to 10mm. This might work for a few people, but you should really just get the in between sizes. Luckily, I found pretty cheap 1ga (~7mm) and 9mm sets. They also came with longer tapers that didn't have as steep as an angle. Bonus.\n\nGiven all these issues, I can't possibly give it more than 3 stars. It would be 2 stars if it weren't for the price - There are still a few usable pieces.", "summary": "Seems great at first, but there are some issues.", "unixReviewTime": 1436313600}

If you are a skinny girl, just remember that each size is smaller than what it is. Order accordingly.\n\nNow, a few other details about this is coat.

I bought a green man suit for a sociology project a couple years back. So I have a little bit of 'experience' I guess with these costumes. I ordered this about 11 days ago. The one review said it arrived in his hand in a few days or something? I don't know his (or her's) location, but I live in Baltimore city. I was in no hurry to get it but it was estimated to arrive September 12 - October 3rd. It came in 2 weeks early (with standard shipping.) Props to them. I just wanted it to arrive before Halloween lol.\n\nThe Size: I ordered an adult men size medium, I'm 5'8... It fits perfectly.\n\nThe Mask: Besides the fact that it's removable, visibility through the eyes is about an 8 maybe 9 out 10. In well lit areas.\nAlthough, the black part of the eyes (as you see in the picture) goes down a little bit further than the actual design in the comics.\nBut you can get away with it.\n\nPros: A zipper did come with the suit to go to the bathroom.. which is a definite plus. I missed that part in the summary I guess.\n\nCons: Might need a hand to help get the back zipper up all the way.\n\nOverall, it's a good suit for the price, great for costume parties and any types of cons.

The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row.

I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.\n\n**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them.

After all, if they are bad, it only costs me less than $10.\n\nI was so surprised by the prints and color are perfect as picture. The fabric wise, it was subtle shinny and stretchy and comfortable. On that note, I compared to my real BM swimsuit, BM fabric was thicker and more \"dense\" which that is what you pay for, they wrap you up and tight you in, give you good shape, and it doesn't see though AT ALL. This company's fabric was slightly thinner, which doesn't tight you up as much as BM and if it is light color leggings, it is very little see-though to the panties (just very very little even it is light color leggings). However, I don't feel cheated at all. The fabric is still very nice, I guarantee you that you will feel such a good buy when you et them. Also you are supposed to wear something long to cove your butt to style it so little see-through is not a problem at all!\n\nAll in all, I might have second thought about ordering swim suit because they might not be thick enough but for leggings, I will not hesitated.\n\nP.S.

When shopping I almost always wear a size small, with the exception of clothing such as Aeropostale where I wear a medium shirt size. I decided to order it and take the chance. When I tried it on it just barely fit. Not for anyone with a large bust. I had on a push up bra at a 34 C size and it was a bit tight. I'm 5,5\" and the dress came to a bit above my ankles with the length. The fabric isn't very high quality but it felt pretty nice regardless. Beware of static though. The fabric of this dress can become extremely staticky and it will cling to you. The colors are bright and pretty. The main downside for me is that the pattern wasn't like the one in the picture. Instead of the top having the thick dark blue stripe it was a brown stripe with a little bit of blue on the edge. Also, the elastic gathering in the mid section looks somewhat cheap and poorly made. One weird thing about the dress was that mine had no tag at all and therefore no washing/care instruction. Overall the lightweight bright colored fabric is the strongpoint of the garment.

I had to wash them twice with detergent and twice with baking soda to get the smell out, and as a result, the color faded some (as I kind of expected it would).

The other flaw is that there were puncture holes in the fabric all along the center seem from the crotch to back! Right now they are small puncture holes, but especially because of the placement in this seam they are bound to get bigger faster.  In the picture I have draped the pants over my purple hydro flask so you can see the holes.  This is certainly not a place I'd like growing holes.

The design is so striking, and I find the construction of the sock to be excellent.  Only two comments that brought the rating down to a four-star from a five:  (1)  While the body of the sock fits well, the socks are a bit tight at the top.  I don't mind a snug fit, but I do find I want to take them off in the middle of the night if I go to sleep with them on; and (2) I didn't realize that there would be so many threads on the inside of the sock.  Yes, the design is intricate, but I guess I figured part of the design would be printed, not knitted.  That is my bust on not knowing better; however, all those threads can pose a real \"snag\" hazard.  I've figured a way around it in putting on the socks, but it would have been a nice \"heads up.\"  Overall, I would buy Sock It To Me socks again because of the wonderful designs and good quality.", "summary": "Fun!", "unixReviewTime": 1409875200}

Because they hit right at the thickest part of my calf, you could see the line/indention through my jeans.  They did not leave a mark and they were not tight, it was simply due to the placement.

The circumference of the largest part of my calf is 17\".

I have had other socks from Sock It To Me, and I know that not all of them will fit me, but I am disappointed that these do not. I think they would fit a shorter, skinnier person well, but maybe not someone who was short and chubby or tall and skinny. 2 stars for fit.\n\nAs far as comfort goes, they feel nice on my feet. These socks are not going to make my feet too hot, but they are a little thinner than I would really like.  Not very thin like trouser socks, but not much thicker than that. The socks conform well to my feet with no awkward or uncomfortable bits. They do not cut into my calves, or anywhere else. 4 stars for comfort.\n\nIn terms of style, this sock is quite cute.  Who wouldn't want a trail of wishes floating around their legs?  The colors and pattern are true to the stock photo.  4 stars for style.\n\nSock It To Me is a great brand that I've purchased before, but this sock fails to impress me.

The listing is not as descriptive as I would have liked. Its very hard to find flare jeans lately, even on the internet. I have been buying Amethyst brand jeans and wear a size 18 (I had to stop because they seem to be incapable of admitting their \"flare\" jeans are now actually bootcut and not even close to flare). I am on the larger size, but am 5' 10\" and have large proportions all around. I have larger muscular thighs and calves which makes finding jeans difficult. I ordered these in a size 20 because I was afraid of them fitting small. Many brands claim to be size 18, but usually fit more like a 16 in the hips and waist, and are much too small in the thighs.\n\nOverall fit-wise, these are a little loose on me, as I hoped they would be (having ordering a size up and not having much of a butt) and I have yet to wash them to see how they shrink, or don't shrink, the legs are nice and wide, not tight in the knees and calves. the flare when lying flat is about 20\", which gives it a nice flow at the bottom. Also, the image is definitely of the regular junior sizes. The plus sizes are higher waisted, rising about two or so inches below the belly button, so it doesn't give you muffin-top or show any \"crack\" when you sit.\n\nAs for length, these fit great! Being tall, it's hard to find pants that I would wear with anything other than flats. I generally like my jeans to touch the ground (they usually end up getting walked on and frayed) some people may think these are too long if you prefer a fit more about the ankle.\n\nColor is generally the same as I expected. The image shows it lighter than it arrived, but I like it darker (however, these are not \"dark\" just a shade or two more than the image). I think darker jeans are more work appropriate (if you can wear them to work), which is what I needed these for (professional office). The color will most likely fade a little bit to more of the image color after a dozen or so washes.\n\nOverall the material is thinner than the jeans I have been buying through Amethyst, but the jeans I bought there were exceptionally heavy. So it is probably more of a standard weight material than I think it is.\n\nI am very pleased so far and have ordered a second pair.", "summary": "Great Flares", "unixReviewTime": 1403827200}

I can normally get away with wearing a medium in most clothing. So, with a sweater or jacket, I would normally get a large. But, because Patty usually runs just a tad smaller, I ordered an x-large. It is just a touch big, but not really baggy. And with a sweater, I prefer to not have it too close fitting, anyway. The feel of the fabric is sooooo soft and comfortable. I have had this for several days, now, and I love wearing it so much, that I have even worn it around the house a fair bit. It's got a good, close knit, so it's fairly warm to wear outside. Been wearing it outside in 40 to 50 degree weather, with short sleeved shirts and felt fine with it. But, it's not heavy or hot when I wear it inside, either.\nI do worry about the belt loops, as they are kind of thin, but I just removed the belt, as I don't really like to tie it, anyway. The sleeves are a little long, like in the picture. I kind of like that, personally. But, it's easy enough to just roll them up, too. And it still looks cute like that! Shipping was fast, as it often is with Patty items. And the quality of the product is excellent, as I'm learning to expect from them, as well. Would definitely recommend this item. I'm almost tempted to buy another before they run out, as a back up for when this one wears out. :-P", "summary": "Love wearing this!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1390003200}

If Patty no longer carries it, too bad. Best purchase I've made through her and pretty much anything. Both sweaters still look new and are comfortable and warm, but breathe so you don't get overwarm.\n\nEDITED 7/15/2014 - I LIVE in these sweaters!!! Because of several health issues, I live near the ocean but must keep the humidity as low as I can get it (how unfair is,that???). So, I sleep on the sweaters (not both together), and if I wake up cold in the night, I wrap myself in these wonderful, soft, hearty sweaters. They have been washed many times and hung to dry, and they still look brand new. They have become like blankets to me! Best purchase I have ever made. Patti, you are a genius! Thank you for these sweaters. Don't ever stop carrying them!\n\nEDITED: 3/30/2014 - I ended up getting another one of these sweaters in black & white (there's a name for that that escapes me). Now I have TWO of these wonderful sweaters and have washed the dark tan sweater and I have to say, it still looks awesome! In fact, now that it is FINALLY getting a little warmer here, I often don't need the sweater any longer. Woke up this morning, was freezing, forgot I left my black/white one out in the living room - did I grab my poor neglected fuzzy bath robe? No! I got the dark tan one out of my closet and have been loving it since. Still in love, now with TWO sweaters! ALMOST makes me regret upcoming summer :-). I am going to give this sweater 10 stars and if you like cozy, soft slightly big sweaters to curl up in, get it. You can always send it back if it isn't your style!\n\nOriginal review: When I first opened the beautiful box they ship their clothing in (classy touch!), I admit, I was a little let down. It was bulky and the color wasn't great and I almost sent it back. Thank GOD I didn't send it back. It is extremely soft and cozy, as others have remarked. I wear a lot of black, so I wanted to buy it in black, but I don't think it comes in black. The weather here in Maine has been all over the place since November, one day 40 degrees F, the next 5 degrees F. Because I like to sleep quite cool @58 degrees, it's been crazy. I go to bed in a T-shirt, wake up four hours later and it's 53 degrees in the room. I went perusing my closet and grabbed Patti's sweater. I have LIVED in it since!! I don't care if it matches my outfit or not, I think this is my favorite sweater of all time. I end up sleeping in it, and it's like sleeping on five down pillows!!! I pull the hood over my eyes and nose, and I am so toasty when I wake up, it's hard to get myself out of bed. BUT, it's so versatile and well made, nobody would ever think I sleep in it! So, I can say without hesitation, I am in love with a sweater!! I walked thru Wal Mart the other day and saw one just like it by one of their vendors at half the price. I tried it on. The softness wasn't there, it was badly made, it wasn't even close to Patti's sweater. I felt much better! So far, PATTI has the best clothes of any vendor I have checked. Do yourself a favor, splurge on this sweater if you really feel the cold. I believe there is some rabbit fur in it, so if you are allergic to the fur, don't get it (and I am SO sorry). It is well made, even though it was a knitted sweater with large needles, I have, as I said, worn it a lot and no pulls or breaks in the yarn. It still looks like the day I took it out of the box. My poor fuzzy bathrobe has been replaced!!! Thank you, once again, PATTI! You clothing always makes me smile and feel so comfortable and stylish. Greatest women's clothing out there in my opinion!", "summary": "PATTI HITS IT OUT OF THE PARK ONCE AGAIN!", "unixReviewTime": 1387929600}

The knitted material feels enjoyably soft and is on the thinner side, perfect for layering with an undershirt. The colour is such a vibrant shade of red, very striking and I rather like it. The pattern is horrible, the reindeer look more like chihuahuas with antlers. The sleeves are just long enough to be appropriate, but then the body of the sweater is extra long and versatile; it covers my bum completely if paired with leggins, but also looks well bunched up for a voluminous look with denims. If you are anything other than a petite woman by American standards, I would not attempt to buy this product; I am 5'2\" and 107 lbs, and it fits me perfectly. The only reason I did not rate higher stars is on account of A.) two 1\" parallel gouges in the knitting on the right of the chest that appears to be a flaw in the manufacturing and B.) it smells funny, so douse it in perfume or wash it straight away.

Much less turquoise and red, and much more dark blue and orange instead. The pattern is also a larger print with not quite as many details. Still, for the price and the dress itself--the material is silky-smooth--I like it quite a bit, even though it isn't exactly what I had anticipated.", "summary": "Not quite what I expected, but not dissatisfied", "unixReviewTime": 1410307200}

The suit fits a bit roomy from the waist down. It is very difficult to get on because of the cross straps. They are stretched to the max getting them past your hips. The top fits snug which is great for support but not so great for getting over your ample hips. There is a snug elastic strap that goes around your body. These straps have never seemed to fit me in the right place. It does not fall just under my bust but rather a bit further down. I am a bit long in the torso. If you pull it up to just under your bust, which is hard to do because of how snug the top is, the top of the back of the suit is a bit affected. For me, that would not be a deal breaker for this suit. On the positive side, it's of good quality, very attractive, never rides up and the straps will never slide down. It also gives you a very nice shape. The built in bra does a good job. I use the suit for swimming and water aerobics. If you have large hips you may want to purchase one size up just so you can get it on(cross straps). If you are larger than a C cup, you may want to skip this one or go two sizes up. However doing that may give you too loose of a fit below the waist. Im keeping it. I think those straps have met their match and will eventually loosen under the pressure of traveling over my ample hips.", "summary": "Difficult to get on but very attractive.", "unixReviewTime": 1409788800}

While most are tolerable, they generally all look like the glasses you get when you leave your eye doctor--not exactly something to wear often in public.  However, as a life-time prescription glasses wearer, I have found that I use the wear-overs far more frequently than if I were to switch to my Rx sunglasses--which is a pain.  I can easily flip the wear-overs off/on, much like regular sunglasses.  This is obviously good for my eye health.  The Duco semi-rimless glasses are lightweight (which might be a concern regarding durability), but what I like is the frame is only partial, and there are no large side-shields.  While the lack of side shields does allow some sun to enter from the periphery (which is not an advantage for activities like fishing), the glasses look much more \"normal\", and my wife even complimented me on their looks.  I also like that they do not have separate nose bridge/pads.  They are designed to rest on the top of my existing glasses, which is very comfortable.  My only negative is that I wish I could buy these in non-polarized plastic.  I am a pilot, and the polarized lens interferes with the screen of my iPad and iPhone when I fly, which I use for navigation and other flight information.  But all in all, a great product.

As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration.

The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way.

I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.\n\n**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them.

I wear a medium but decided to order a large, afraid it would run small. Thankfully I did, because it runs small. So the large fits perfectly. The material looks and feels like polyester/rayon. Doesn't look expensive, but it's cute with a pair of jeans. The sleeves fit my arms well, which isn't always the case since my arms are slightly muscular in size. The 3/4 sleeve is cute but if you do a lot of elbow bending the jacket becomes uncomfortable because the sleeves end at the crease of my elbow. You can roll up the sleeve to prevent the discomfort of the sleeve, but then you lose the yellow in the cuff and I was only able to roll up once. It was too snug in the sleeves to roll up twice. So, I scrunched up the sleeve above my elbow to keep the yellow showing. Worked much better this way. This jacket has no stretch at all, so I suggest order up a size and have it tailored if necessary. My only issue is with the five inch long zipper in the front. It should be longer or no zipper at all. And in fits like a double breasted jacket if zipped, but has no button on the inside to keep the jacket from bunching up on the inside. Looks best unzipped, but I'm going to have a snap closure added on the inside so I can wear it zipped up for a sleeker look with a A line skirt.

It is one of the softest, most comfortable items I own. The exterior is a thick, durable cotton/polyester blend. I can't say enough about how great the inside feels - the interior is a fleecy cotton that just makes you want to say \"ahh\". Considering the cost of this sweatshirt, I am pleasantly surprised by its quality. The cut and stitching are excellent. No loose threads or awkward seams. The zippers (yes, plural - this is a double zip sweatshirt, which is actually pretty neat) are exceptionally shiny and sturdy - they really look great.  The pockets - love, love, love them! They are so spacious and warm.\n\nRegarding size - I recommend ordering a size (or two!) up, depending upon your desired fit. I'm 5'4 and 125lbs. To counteract shrinking (this is cotton, remember) and to ensure a roomy fit, I purchased a size XL - great decision. It fits perfectly.\n\nOne final thing - although this sweatshirt is hooded, this more of a style feature rather than a functional hood. The hood is very short, presumably to ensure that it drapes evenly across the shoulders.

I may have been able to go with a smaller size, but given the inability to try it on in advance of ordering, I am happy with the fit of the size 10 I ordered (I am 5\"3 and generally wear a size 9 in juniors and 6 in misses).  Overall I found this dress to provide excellent on trend value for the price and I can't wait to wear it and get lots of admiring or envious double takes!", "summary": "Wear This If You Want Attention...", "unixReviewTime": 1385942400}

There is a ceremonial elegance to removing the watch from your vest watch pocket, snapping open the case, and reading the graceful hands against the Roman numerals; quite unlike replying to texts with your thumbs while chatting with friends.\n\nThe watch is satisfyingly heavy, with solid stem and fob, and detachable chain. Setting and winding have a smooth feel. The case opens and closes with authoritative snaps. It keeps time acceptably well. The works are visible enough to figure out how the watch works, and if you go in for precision machinery, has an hypnotic appeal.\n\nI recommend this for lovers of fine design and engineering.", "summary": "Fine design and workmanship", "unixReviewTime": 1407369600}

What I loved is the back of it which the picture doesn't show. There is white floral lace in the back on the shoulders which completely adds more cuteness to the shirt. I remembered reading a review on this shirt saying that it feels like a girly shirt yet it's sophisticated at the same time and I would agree completely. I would recommend wearing this with a black pencil skirt or trousers since it's so cute and girly and it'd look lovely to add some womanly-ness to it. It could be worn to the office, to school, or wherever. It is a shirt that would be very easy to work with in terms of being classy or casual.

I don't have it positioned to create cleavage, so I'll have to test it out that way as well. The color is what's pictured, but in the package, it looks like raw, skinless chicken breasts.
