Trust in Grooves sizing advice, I'm a big guy with \"gnarly knuckles\" and my ring finger measures 12 to 12.5 to 13. My Titanium ring was a size 13 but a tad too big. Probably why I lost it,but the smaller sizes felt way too tight,so I got measured and was a 12.5 at the time and the Groove Advice was to go down a size to a 12 and I couldn't be happier! Just snug enough, no circulation problems and with the \"design\" of the ring I'm not sure if it will ever get snagged on anything!  It's \"tapered\"smooth, it's not hot, and does not have an odor like some others!  I'm an active bassist and play guitars as well this ring never gets in the way! TRY IT !!

I went on a vacation and really put the ring to the test.  I put on sunscreen, sailed, did some water skiing, swam, and paddleboarded.  Where other rings have become oddly crusty with sunscreen or cracked after drying in saltwater, these rings kept their original comfort and appearance.\n\n3.  Style- Some rings may come in glow in the dark or plain color design, Groove Rings offer the benefits described above AND a stylish design.  The color inside of the ring makes the ring stand out and is especially handy when snatching it from the nightstand before heading to the gym in the early hours of the morning.  The sizing is also spot on...which other rings seem to have an issue with.\n\nAll in all, this ring is worth every cent.

I work on cars a lot and was looking for a better ring option as I keep marking my rings up, or I lose them after they fall of my tool box or where ever I set it when I took it off and it rolled away never to be seen again. LOL\nI loved this thing for the first few days but yesterday my finger turned red and blistered under the ring.  NOT GOOD! It's rather painful.\nI am not 100% sure why this happened. I may have gotten soap trapped under it so it may have been partly my fault. Or I might just not be able to wear this material. I'm not sure yet.\nThe ring seems well made. And looked and felt great for the few days I was able to wear it.\nI broke out the most right where there logo is inside of the band. There is no venting there. So that's why I think I might have gotten soap trapped there and it caused the problem. I washed my hands at a department store with there cheap soap about 12 hours before the problem occurred. I have never had a problem like this with metal rings. Or soap in the past. But I am not 100% sure what caused this so I will not blame the ring totally. But I as said I have never had this problem before this ring either.\n\nI plan to give my finger a week to fully heal up and then try the ring again. This time I will be sure to rinse better after washing my hands and see if that solves the problem. If it still comes back then I guess this ring is just not for me.  :(\nI really hope it does not come back tho. I LOVE how comfortable this ring is.\n\nI am reporting this now, but I will amend this after my finger heals and I can try the ring again. (3-6 weeks from now I will report back.)\nPlease note that I have had skin problems in the past and as such am probably more susceptible to things such as this than the average person.\nTho I have never had problems with gloves, or rings before, I have also never tried to wear anything made from silicone before either.\nJust trying to be honest here.\n\nThank you.", "summary": "Comfortable but may have caused blistering?

Each stone is perfectly cut and reflects an unbelievable amount of light for incredible sparkle. When I put them on, I was surprised that they didn't feel heavy, especially compared to many chandelier-type earrings that I've tried on. The \"open back\" design behind each stone (see pics) allows for the stones to sparkle from every angle possible (I've never seen this design before - it's genius).\n\nEach earring has 11 perfectly crafted elliptical/lens-shaped CZ stones and is about 1.75\" long. The silver around each stone blends in and creates an illusion that the stones are \"floating\" so to speak. These earrings look so much more expensive than their price tag on Amazon, and they would be perfect for a wide array of dressier events including on your wedding day. They would also make a beautiful gift, and they come carefully packaged in a black gift box.\n\nI am just blown away at how absolutely gorgeous these earrings are. The design, craftsmanship, and quality are insurmountable. I cannot recommend these earrings enough - they will make you feel like a princess, and every girl deserves to feel this way! <3\n\n*Discounted product received for testing and review purposes.

My back has been much less sore which has helped me to work harder during the day and still feel well enough to get stuff done at home at the end of the day.  The material stretches very well and allows one to bend over and sit down comfortably.  Also, an extra benefit to be mentioned is that my appetite seems to be somewhat suppressed which helps me to cut back on eating snacks throughout the day or overeating during meals.

It was pretty dang hard to fasten the hooks the first time to the first row, but after a couple of days I was down to the next row of hooks because I think it stretches out a bit, but I'm glad it does.

The watch itself is beautiful, no problems. I took one star off for the difficulty of removing extra links. Watch came with no instructions, for adjusting time or for removing links. Adjusting time isn't a problem, but how to remove the links isn't exactly common knowledge. I found out that it doesn't matter which side you push the pins out of because the pins are the same both sides. Further more, you need the right size pin to pound the pins out of the links, and you having to be careful with the hammer so as not to break the wood, as my husband did. We glued the broken piece back on.\nI feel that the seller should include a small pin (the cost would be minimal) as well as good instructions on how to remove the extra links. I just happened to find a small pin in my junk drawer that happened to do the job, but somebody else might not be so lucky. My teen son was originally very interested in the watch, but the frustration of not knowing how to remove the links made him lose interest in the watch altogether. Or, you can do as another reviewer recommends and ask a jeweler to do it for you.

It is a casual looking watch, but so unique in the look. I have never seen one like this in a wood look. His friends have been really interested in getting one, and have asked me where to order it from!\n\nIt does have an adjustable wrist size, and is analog. It is not for swimming or diving but it is water resistant which is great. It has auto date, perpetual calendar and is non toxic hypoallergenic!\n\nI have to say I was truly surprised by the quality and how light weight this watch is- I examined it and held it prior to wrapping it. My son expressed the same immediately after he opened it- and put it on.\n\nIt truly looks wonderful s d it is definitely an eye catcher. Mostly because you do not tend to see a watch made of or looking like wood!\n\nI did give it this my son as a gift,  and was so impressed with the nice box that it comes in. He can use that to place it in when he is not wearing it.\n\nI was able to order this at a promotional price in exchange for my honest unbiased opinion.

When I put these leggings on I noticed there were two holes in the crotch of the leggings...I took them off and saw that the seam had not been finished off which is why there were holes (nothing a needle and thread couldn't  fix but still irritating that a brand new product was sent to me unfinished)  2- I purchased these to be fun workout pants and they still will be (I work out in my own home) but when I put these on I noticed they are see through. I could see the print of my underwear through the pants. These will still work for me but if I were going to a gym or somewhere. in public I probably wouldn't wear them. 3- these pants aren't a true black I would say once they are on they appear to be more of a charcoal color.

It was way too tight so I used their super easy and convenient return (everything is in the box) and reordered it in L.  I lost some more weight and ordered another vest in L and had the original vest tailored to fit.  I love wearing these vests and now feel somewhat undressed without one on.  They are perfect for around horses because the wool does not show or retain stains even if the horse wipes his nose on you.  Washing them in Woolite leaves them soft and nice looking without the bother of having them dry cleaned.  I have received a lot of positive comments regarding these vests.  I only wish they came in brighter colors (like canary yellow or tattersall), but that's not for everybody.  If unsure of your size, be sure to order one at least a size larger and besides, it is easy for a tailor to make an oversized vest fit, but impossible if it's too small.

The only advisement i would have is that if you're much larger than a c or d cup it doesnt have the absolute best support, but what sports bra really does unless you spend a fortune on it?

That doesn't bother me because I'll be using that area to shorten the angled straps to fit me better.\n\nI would have bought a smaller size had I tried it on at a store; at least this isn't hanging off of me.

It's so beachy and fun that it's hard to resist getting everything you own in that color, including jewelry. This necklace is a great accompaniment to any aqua-lover's collection, myself included.\n\nUnlike most jewelry I've received or bought from Amazon, this actually feels really well built and not horribly cheap. All of the links on the golden chain are closed/soldered together, and it even comes with a few inches of extension in case you want to layer it or make it longer. The aqua pieces themselves are some type of enamel-esque material that's bright and glossy and feels nice in your hands. It's heavy and feels as though it could have been bought from somewhere way higher-end than Amazon.\n\nAs for wearing it, I haven't had any issues so far. It feels okay on my skin and hasn't left any green or black marks. In fact, I'm hoping to wear this to a job interview tomorrow! The only thing that seems slightly different is that the triangles are all the same size, whereas in the picture the outer triangles look slightly smaller. I don't mind this at all. I think it's a very cute look and can work for many different styles. The good thing is, the necklace isn't as dramatic as some bib-type necklaces. The triangles are about 1.5 to 2 inches big, roughly, so it's great for making a statement without being \"extra\".\n\nI like this piece. For me, it's an introduction to bib-necklaces and statement pieces. I don't have anything like this at all in my jewelry collection and it inspires me to search for more unique pieces like this. I live on the beach too, so it's great to have something fun and bright and cheerful to wear with all my tropical styled clothes that also looks professional. It's a solid little necklace and has great potential!\n\nI was given a discount on this item in exchange for an honest review.

I will say I am 95% sure these are only for around the house use for me. The waistband is really comfortable, I have a bunch of room around the waist so I had to pull it pretty tight. I will say that they are pretty long, I have about 6 inches of fabric that just hangs at the bottom. I don't mind the extra fabric and it would work well on a taller woman.

For those of you who like to change things up a little, this blue heart, multi-faceted crystal which is \"roped\" in white gold plating that is embedded with clear crystals could well be for you. The heart is approximately 1\" x 1 1/4\" so on the larger size. This necklace is quite heavy in the fact that you know you are wearing it. The three stranded leather chain is approximately 18\". Pretty and a little different from other fashion jewelry. I LOVE it.\n\nThe red heart crystal (1\" x 1 /8\" x 3/8\" deep) is encased in rose gold plated embedded clear crystals which actually goes well with the 'rose gold' 17 1/2\" rope chain.\n\nPLEASE note that this review is for both the BLUE and RED HEART Crystal necklaces and  NOT the clear crystal.

Additionally, I am 5 ft 5 inches and this dress comes to my ankles.\nI'm trying to decide if I will adjust the bodice by detaching and re-sewing the bodice to make it an empire...  but I will be shortening it even more by doing that so probably the best idea is just to return it.  This will be a house dress, not to wear out and about, so I'm not so worried about the fit after I adjust it if I decide to keep rather than return.  I'm not looking forward though, to sewing a new dress to adjust it because the manufacturer messed up and the seller misrepresented....\nIf you order, do not size up like so many said and if you want it full length and you're taller than 5\"6\" or want to wear this with heels, don't order.\nThe fabric quality is poor also, thin and snags easily.\nYou get what you pay for.", "summary": "Think twice before ordering.", "unixReviewTime": 1452556800}

All the Austria bare crystals and Czech rhinestones shine brilliantly.\n\nThe length of the necklace is adjustable and comes with a lobster claw clasp.\n\nIt is a unique set that gets plenty of compliments and looks.\n\nArrives nicely boxed in a pink velvet gift box.\n\nDisclaimer:  Product sample provided for free or discounted for an honest unbiased review with no means of payment or incentives offered in exchange.", "summary": "Truly a unique set", "unixReviewTime": 1442534400}

I tend to be allergic to some materials and metals, and hate wearing necklaces that irritate or rub off when you wear them.\n\nThis set is absolutely gorgeously packaged in a soft pink velvet case.  It makes it completely appropriate for gift giving with no additional wrapping needed.  The necklace is on a double chain and closes in the back with a rather small lobster clasp.  Despite it's small size I had no problems opening and closing it on my own.  It also has an extender chain which I took full advantage of.  After wearing it for 2 full days I was happy to see that I had no allergic reactions to the metals of this set.  The color did not rub off, nor did I develop a rash.\n\nThe earrings require pierced ears and do not dangle.  They are a beautiful match to the necklace and are comfortable to wear.  While they are fairly big, they do not feel heavy.  I applied a single coat of clear nail polish to the studs to prevent any possible allergic reaction.\n\nOverall I am very pleased with this set.  They look beautiful with just about any outfit and are comfortable to wear.  I am thrilled that I received a sample at no cost to me in exchange for my honest review.  While I do not always rate products a 4 or a 5 star, I will do so when I feel a product is worthy of such a rating.

I put it in my cart, but decided to save it for a later purchase. Over the next hour, however, I was compelled to keep bringing the page up for another look. Naturally I broke down and ordered it that same day!  It arrived a few days ago and I was excited to see it in person. It came in a large, sturdy gift box. I was perplexed by the choice of a pale pink box for this particular set, since it not only did nothing to highlight the pieces, the effect was actually off-putting. Since I bought it for myself it was not a big deal, but if it had been a gift, I think I would have repackaged the items in a neutral-colored box, which would have made the pieces really stand out. Anyhow, I donned the necklace immediately, right over my Pink Floyd t-shirt. It was a bit looser than a choker, but there's about an inch worth of extending links in case you want a little more length. The clasp was sturdy and there were no loose pieces. The pierced earrings were in equally good shape, and they did not have that too heavy feeling that makes my earlobes hurt for days afterwards. The necklace is made even more unique looking because there're actually two very fine chains on each side of the centerpiece, something I hadn't noticed in the picture, but found to be a quite pleasant surprise. Yesterday, my first outing since the order arrived, I simply wore black jeans and a black t-shirt, and the set looked amazing. It was not too much for the middle of the afternoon, but I think this set can easily be worn at an evening out as well. It's already obvious to me that this is going to be a favorite set of mine, and I'm already anticipating wearing it with other outfits.

In order to have it stay in place, she had to pull the chain up higher above so it's tighter, but that ends up feeling uncomfortable due to the tightness required to keep it in place.\n\nShe's not the type to give up comfort for beauty, so she won't be using it as an ankle bracelet (and using it as an arm bracelet also has the problem of causing the feeling of tightness).

I had some trouble putting the bras on when I first received them, but I've since figured out that if I put the bra on open like a shirt, then push aside the little flap at the bottom of the zipper & zip it up over my chest above my boobs, I can pull it down over my boobs, do a wee bit of adjusting and voila!

I did notice that the padding that comes in them is a bit thicker than I'd like. If you can imagine a basic lined bra, the padding in these is thicker than that. Its not terrible but if one happens to break in the future I will replace it and get a large.", "summary": "Somewhat tight but basically pretty good", "unixReviewTime": 1493337600}

There is clearly a defect in the zipper that the manufacturer needs to correct.  I'm very disappointed as I really liked these in every other way.  But clearly, having no zipper makes these useless to me.  I am returning them to Amazon.", "summary": "Nice workout bra", "unixReviewTime": 1484870400}

One other thing I would add is that I've found I have to protect the delicate skin area underneath the bottom zipper cover (with a band-aid) when I wear this bra to go for a run, otherwise it rubs the skin off.  And it's also easier to put the bra on (over the head) with the zipper closed than to try to zip it up while holding everything in - just a tip!

It was quite snug initially, but I thought they would work. But post surgery, I had some swelling in my chest and it was so uncomfortably tight that I felt like a sausage. It was horrible. I couldn't wait to get home to get the bra off. At 128 lbs, I never thought I would need an XL, but that is what I probably should have purchased. #2. Zippers not great. Because the bra was so tight it was hard to pull up (especially post surgery with limited arm mobility). One of the zipper pulls broke on the 2nd time I wore the bra. I had to use a safety pin to pull the zipper - didn't work great and was a hassle. #3. Poor stitching on one bra. One of the bras was stitched poorly up the front and resulted in some itchy fabric against my skin. I had to place some gauze between the bra and my skin to keep from itching raw.

I would recommend going a size up at least. While I do like the removable cups that add a little better shape when exercising and running, I hate the tiny openings in the layers of the cup because once you take them out to wash the bra it's a pain in the butt to get them back in. They usually end up a curled up, misshapen mess when you try to replace them after washing. The other problem I have with these bras is the zipper. They have a piece of the soft fabric placed nicely to protect you from the bottom of the zipper and that lays over the top of the zipper as well, which is a nice touch. However, the hard plastic at the bottom of the zipper and where the zipper comes up to the top still rubs uncomfortably when running or working out, specially doing the rowing machine. The colors are great, the fabric is comfortable and no 'itchy' spots.

For size reference, I'm 5'2, 120-125 lbs, 30GG in Fantasie brand bras, my ribs, under my breasts, measure 29 inches. So, I'm petite and very chesty, pretty active and I NEED tight sports bras, so I know what tight fitting is and this is NOT tight at all. I'm not buying these to work out with though. I'm buying these to use as post-op bras for my breast reduction in October. I heard you should go a few sizes bigger to accommodate for swelling and these reviews are all over the place! Even at my current size, they covered me, they zipped fine, the band was not tight or overly loose, but definitely not enough support for my current size to attempt to workout in, but I need underwire sports bras because of my size. These bras have no adjustments, so being short, I will need to take in the shoulder straps probably an inch at my current size, so once reduced, I may need to take them in more. I am planning on ordering a smaller size, but wondering how the coverage will be, but I'll take my chances because at $7.05 per bra if you buy the 5 pack, you can't go wrong! I hear you need a few to change out often, so $35 for 5 bras or $35+ for one bra, you decide what is the better deal. Plus, the zipper front I believe will be great vice a bunch of hooks.\n\nShipping: I ordered them last week and they arrived in 2 days as prime shipping promises. I ordered this early because a lot of reviews mentioned not receiving their order for weeks, so I was planning ahead and they came what earlier than expected.\n\nBras: They are 5 different colors, which are great, and came in 5 individually wrapped zip lock type bags.\n\nI'm not sure if people are not reading the size chart correctly or do not know their real bra size, which most women do not wear the correct size, so I can't wait to see what the Small or Medium fits like because that's going off my band size. So, even with the shoulder straps being long and the band NOT being tight enough for my liking, I am still happy with my purchase, just need to order a smaller size.\n\nHope this helps future purchases! Make sure you know your right bra size before ordering. Also, sports bras are supposed to be tight! You are working out and need to be supported, not flopping all over the place! That's just my liking though because I run and do high intense workouts that need the girls to stay put, but I need underwire. These would be more suited for walking, yoga,  light activities. Maybe when I'm smaller, ill see about a bra like this for working out again, but once I tried underwire sports bras, which like most probably think they wouldn't be comfortable, they are awesome! Especially if you are a DDD or bigger.\n\nAs I mentioned above, I bought these mainly for post-op bra purposes and I think they are awesome! Now I just have to wait until my surgery.", "summary": "Great Post-Op Bras, do NOT think they run small either...", "unixReviewTime": 1461801600}

In size large and extra large respectively. I very much like the fabric and the fit of the cups for both sizes. The band's under the busy however run small and can be too tight depending on your preferences.\n\nAbout Me: (In relation to product, size, reason for purchase, etc) I am 21 years old, 5'2\", and weigh 143lbs. The circumference of my underbust is 33inches, therefore my bra size could be a 36/38/B/C depending on the bra of course. I have recently gained about 35lbs due to health issues and will be starting physical therapy next month, hence my need for sports bras. I prefer that they zip in the front because they are easier to get on and off. I needed something that was comfortable, yet supportive, because with my weight gain I have gone from an A Cup to a C Cup roughly.\n\nMy Experience: These bras come individually packed in custom zipper bags (see photos posted by other reviewers) however do not have any tags to indicate a \"new item\", like many of us are used to seeing. Don't let that deter you from buying the bras, they arrived spotless, free of wrinkles, and very much brand new.\n\nI initially purchased the 4 pack, size Large, using the size chart available. But when I tried them on I had a difficult time zipping them due to a \"lack of slack\" and they were too tight around my under bust to be comfortable despite being very supportive and conformingly comfortable in the cups (once successfully zipped).\n\nI kept them because I know once I'm able to exercise again I will lose an inch or two here and there and the size Large will be snug enough to provide control over my \"girls\" while running and HIIT type of exercise.\n\nMoving on, I then purchased the 5 pack, in Size Extra Large, to use for now and then later as an every day/yoga/ lazy day bra. The extra large are easier to zip than the large for me, they provided the right amount of \"extra slack\" needed. However, they are still slightly too tight under my bust to be comfortably worn all day. For an hour of exercise though, they do the trick.\n\nOther Factors: The quality and colors are amazing. I have washed both sets and they did not run, the colors are vibrant, and the foam cup inserts actually match the color of the bra which was a nice surprise when I discovered that. I am very happy with the quality and the little extra touches like the matching cups, and even the fabric zipper covers on both ends.\n\nThe price is where it's at, I purchased 9 zipper closure sports bras that are FLATTERING AND SUPPORTING for under $60 and received them in two days with prime shipping. 9 awesome bras, for the price of one seemingly overpriced Victorias Secret sports bra with the same zipper closure.\n\nWhy Not 5 Stars? : The sizing is a tad frustrating. These are made in China and I do believe they are more of \"Asian\" sizes than \"U.S.\" or \"European\". I mean no disrespect. Only that Asians are more naturally petite so these bras absolutely do run small. Not so much a cup size problem, as they are stretchy and hug your curves accordingly, but the circumference of the band in relation to the size of an average woman's under bust measurement is off, and runs tight. But as I said in the beginning, it's all about personal preference.\n\nI love these bras, I only wish they came in an XXL, then they would be a perfect 5 star product.", "summary": "I only wish they came in XXL!!", "unixReviewTime": 1453161600}

I recognize that a review of a free product is something fundamentally different from that of a product for which one has paid but I do believe such reviews can be useful when the process is respected and I've tried to do that here.\n\nWhat you're getting with this order:\n(1) Flat cap, imitation leather\n\nWhat is this, and why might I want it?:\nA flat cap has many different names, paperboy, golf etc... but the look is unmistakable, a short, stiff brim with a rounded top the comes almost to the edge of that brim.  This one is NOT real leather (you should realize that simply by looking at the price) but a soft \"pleather\" which I believe is polyurethane.  It has an elastic band and is one size fits all.  Please note that at the posting of this review the cap is being offered at the lower end of the budget price point at under $8 and will be judged as such.\n\nBuild: The build far exceeds my expectations for a sub $8 hat.  I honestly didn't know one could still buy a hat for under ten bucks.  This is NOT leather it is pleather.  It is thin and quite soft but the cap is well made. Stitching has no flaws, the shape is correct and the fit is good. I've been wearing it a few times a week for about a month and haven't had issues with durability.\n\nAppearance: Classic flat cap. Pleather does look like real leather on first glance.\n\nFit: One size fits all. Mine fits me quite comfortably and it is so light, I almost can almost forget it's on. It doesn't breathe well though and so I find myself doffing it now and again when the temps are up.\n\nAnything else of note?: At the posting of this review, the cap is being offered with free shipping allowing one to keep the cost under $8.\n\nAny negatives?: For a less than $8, I don't really have any complaints.  But as mentioned, it doesn't breathe really well so if you run hot like me, you'll notice.\n\nBottom line: Be honest here, did you know you could still buy a hat for less than ten bucks?  Is this a high quality hat build wise? Of course not. But it's better than costume quality, you can actually wear this out (I have and do) and it looks pretty damned good all things considered.  If you're looking for a leather flat cap that will last for years, keep looking as this is neither leather nor is it thick enough to last for years. If you're looking for a flat cap that looks the part and has you spending less than $8, then this is your hat.

I'm 6-1 and weigh 190.  Thin build.  I usually order an XL in shirt size, but after losing a little weight recently, I can squeeze into a large once in awhile.

Not too tight and not too loose.  Wide array of color choices to choose from.  Material is thin, very similar to rash guard and feels almost silky.  Very comfortable.  Dries quick.  I ordered 3 initially and ordered two more after my first order.  Great workout shirt and I plan to wear it on HOT days and working out.  I think it'll be a great shirt for canoeing.\n\nFrankly, there is nothing I would change.  If forced to suggest a change, I would offer more logos.

I purchased the \"Light Orange\" and it is just that - a light, pleasant not-quite-coral-orange shade that will be wonderful for both spring and summer (I already wore it paired with some royal  blue accessories and was told repeatedly I looked like a beautiful spring day). Paired with brown it would probably also be lovely for autumn. I've already ordered another color, I liked it that much. It fits perfectly allover and is quite slimming.

I am breathing, and smiling. I am very large up top, and have gained a LOT of weight, I was very very nervous that this dress would NOT fit, as I have never had great luck ordering clothes online before.  This is for a Bridesmaid dress.  I was looking for something I could wear in a Church wedding, wear a bra, below the knee, and definitely NOT have cleavage hanging out.  Not to mention \"color\" issues.  I was looking for a peach/coral.  There really aren't a lot of choices that fit those requirements under $250.  I was so nervous about trying this out.  I worried for nothing.  The color although listed as \"light orange\" was really as close as I could have gotten it in the largest bridal store in person.  The coverage is perfect, and the big one, the size,  Not only did it go on and zip right up, the fabric has some give in it, almost like a spanx type quality, making the fabric not light and flimsy or stiff but flowing nicely and hugging in the right places yet forgiving in the other places.  I ordered it on a Tuesday night and it was here by Friday afternoon, and I live in the middle of nowhere,  and overnight or 2 day shipping is ALWAYS a joke, but not this time.  As with any formal,  it had to be hung  and steamed, and will look really cute with a petticoat.  I had read all the reviews so I expected some issues with the zipper, and possibly the sewing quality.  I do need to put a couple stitches around the zipper as it appears a couple stitches were dropped but the hems look ok so far.  So really surprised at the quality, coverage, fit,  color  and rocketship fast shipping of this dress factoring in the price it's a win win. If you have been researching and reading review after review just go ahead and hit click.  All the reviews say they have a great return policy, you can't beat the price, and they must use a time machine for shipping.

The attention I received seemed to amp up my ego and made me to let go of my fear to approach women. The women responded well - most wanted to take a photo with me. It's a really weird feeling having strangers wanting to take a photo with you. I felt like a celebrity for the night. Good times!\n\nThe glasses are well made and feature sort-of tinted lens on the inside and mirrored on the outside. The mirrored lens was cool - I could hide my eyes from others. There is a certain level of mysteriousness and style added when others cant see your eyes. I know it sounds ridiculous to wear sunglasses at night but the lens are cool. I was also able to easily pop out the lens and put them back in. The glasses come with a clear pouch to protect them and store them. The wire leading to the battery pack comes from the back of the frame behind the ear and is hidden well. I was able to completely hide the wire under my shirt except for the 6 inch area leading from my ear to the top of my shirt.  One of my friends with long hair was able to completely hide the wire with his hair when he wore them.\n\nI stored the battery pack in my pants pocket. It makes a slight whining sound when on. When I turned it on at home in silence, I thought I was going to have to listen to it all night. But luckily once it is in your pocket you can barely hear it. Add the sounds at any public location is enough to make the high pitch tone completely unnoticeable.\n\nLongevity is great.

The effect really comes into it's own as the ambient light comes down. Powered by a pair of \"AA\" batteries, the control pack attaches via a proprietary connector to the lead wire that merges into one of the frame arms. A single button on it's face controls it's functions: steady on/slow flash/fast flash and off.\n\nThe frames are clear except for the EL treatment and are lightweight at 1.4 ounces. They are 5 1/4 inches across the front and will fit any size head even adult with no problem. Nicely gift packaged in a thick zip lock envelope, suitable for gift giving.

I wore these to a friend's bachelorette party and they were definitely a conversation starter. They drew a lot of attention.\nThey are comfortable to wear and didn't both my ears at all. The only downside is the cord. The cord was annoying but other than that they worked. They are tinted and have a mirror reflection in the lenses. There are 3 different settings on the glasses. There is just solid, slow blink or fast blinking. I will be honest though, if you get seizures or anything to that nature, do not make them blink fast and you will see why in the video I have attached. I wore them on the solid setting as the blinking ended up bothering my eyes. They also make a whistling sound when it's turned on, just like a neon sign would.\nThere were quite a few people at the party I wore them to that kept trying to borrow them. These glasses saw a lot of people that night. They are a blast and draw attention. I walked onto the dance floor with these on and everyone stared at me and it was awesome. These are fun for if you are going to go to a club, party, rave or even just a night out with the girls. They add fun to the mix which is always great. I really do love these glasses because they are different and fun. I do plan on wearing them to other places. I am curious to see how long the batteries last. I had them turned on for 6 straight hours and the batteries didn't die. That's a plus as items like these tend to suck battery life. The cord is easy enough to conceal as well. You can wear it under your clothes and the battery pack has a clip on it so you can clip it to your pants if you want to. I personally wore the cord down my back and clipped it to my pants. All in all, these are a lot of fun and you won't regret the purchase.\nI received these Neon Nightlife glasses at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Fun glasses are a definite conversation starter.", "unixReviewTime": 1458864000}

Like a designer, adult men's shirt. The material is very see through, like a thin linen.  It is fitted through the torso.  It was too small for my huskier 10 year old, who normally wears a size 10 (U.S. sizes) just fine.  I bought a size 12 thinking I wanted it a bit loose in case he wore an undershirt.  It buttoned but barely.  However, my very slender 13 year old was able to wear it, even though he has incredibly long arms (most sleeves are too short for him).  He generally wears a size 14, just so the sleeves are long enough.  This shirt fit him perfectly.  So for that reason, I kept it, even though it's very thin, linen like texture. The tie has an elastic band for around the neck and is long enough, not too short like some.  The pocket hanky has a weird blanket stitch finishing on the edge, poorly made.  The color is a beautiful, vibrant blue.  The thing I liked best about this shirt was the packaging.  Although there was a lot of it, to the point of overkill.  There were three different wraps for around the collar.  The cardboard the shirt was wrapped around, a plastic collar stay, plastic on the tie, four straight pins and 6 to 8 metal twist clips holding the whole thing together, as well as a plastic outer wrap (though ours came ripped open the shirt was clean).  The thing I liked the least and the reason I am giving it three stars is the super thin, material.  Although it is literally see through if the person stands in sunlight, it is rough textured like muslin and stiff like muslin.", "summary": "See through material.

The bag will be good for what i need it for. it is able to fit my kindle fire 8, a journal, sunblock, and my keys, but i will not be able to be the most prepared person with the magic bag of everything that we might need on this trip. overall a very good bag just a little small.\np.s. i know its a mens bag but none of the women's bags were as functional as what i wanted, and this one is.", "summary": "Nice, but smaller then expected", "unixReviewTime": 1522886400}

But really don't think to much about it. after i got the needle through to push it up I put coconut oil on a Q-tip and rub it on the needle and around the needle to help it slide through easily . It is very quick and easy as long as you know what you are doing. Another thing if you don't know what to do i advise you to do some research and watch some videos before trying to do piercing .

I expect this duffel bag will hold up for a long time.\n\n02 A Good Amount of Space - I am using this duffel bag as my emergency first aid bag and there is plenty of room on the inside for my stuff. Inside the duffel bag I keep my first aid kit, a warm blanket, a flashlight, batteries, paracord, a bag of cotton balls, and bottles of hydrogen peroxide, hand sanitizer, and saline.\n\nThere is also a zippered pocket and four zipperless pockets inside of the bag. Two of the zipperless pockets are large enough for phones and other two are suitable for pens and pencils.\n\nOn the outside of the duffel bag is a zippered pocket that is large enough for a wallet and keys. There are also a hand sized pockets on each side of the duffel bag that are kept securely shut with snaps.\n\n03 Stylish and Attractive - The duffel bag is made of PU leather but I think it has the look of real leather. Under close inspection, leather aficionados could probably tell it is not real leather but it is still an attractive duffel bag.\n\n04 Odor Free - I was relieved to find this bag is free of the nasty chemical odor that seems to plague cheaper products made of PU leather. This is a huge plus to me and I imagine this would be a plus for anyone that isn't hard of smelling.\n\n05 Versatile - I like having the option to either carry the bag by the handles or use the included strap and sling it over my shoulder.\n\n06 Unisex - The look of this duffel bag may be geared towards men but it is also suitable for women.\n\nI received this duffel bag free for testing and review.", "summary": "Nice Duffel Bag", "unixReviewTime": 1469318400}

I am really, REALLY picky about what I carry for many reasons:\n\nOne, I need a very versatile bag.  I do not like changing bags out depending on the color outfit I'm wearing but I also hate to have a clashing purse.  This bag has a nice muted black on the bottom, a nice neutral brown, an olive, a khaki, a neutral burgundy and a neutral blue.  All of the colors are nice earth tones.  The versatility is also a factor in the style it presents as a bag.  I prefer a cross body strap, but at times it is more practical to have an off- the- shoulder strap and at other times, such as when I travel on a plane, a back pack style is preferable.  All of these forms are possible with this bag. (It should be mentioned too that the silver handles on top for a hand-carried bag are of nice quality, if that's the form of carriage you would prefer. I don't usually need to have this option but so long as it is there, it is a very big plus that the silver handles look nice on the bag anyhow!)\n\nTwo, I need space for more than a wallet and a phone, but I really need the bag itself to be light, since the stuff I carry in my purse tends to present enough weight in and of itself.  The canvas texture on the outside and the durable cotton lining make for a durable piece without unnecessary additional weight.  The leather straps on the sides and on the bottom (placed there for the purpose of changing the position of the straps from cross- body to back pack to over- the- shoulder are of decent quality.  I expect them to last through some good wear and tear.  The main strap is fully adjustable and a good, wide, stiff canvas military belt- style material.\n\nThree, I love quality items but rarely- if ever- pay full price.  The MSRP on the tag is $109.00, so the list price (currently under $20 at the time of posting this review) is a super stretch- my- dollar deal.  The bottom of the bag is slightly stiff, which I see as a good sign of quality on a soft- shell bag as it does find itself on the floor from time to time.  The enclosed tag also promises a twelve month warranty for rebate or replacement.  I see this also as a sign of quality as any manufacturer backing its item with a respectable warranty indicates their confidence in the product.\n\nFourth, I need an outside pocket for my large phone.  I am very pleased to find that the front zipper pocket is large enough to fit my iPhone 6 Plus without struggling to get it in and out; and now I don't need to struggle with finding my phone at the bottom of my purse!  Having that pocket helps keep the phone in good shape as well because it's not rubbing against other items in the purse.  Win!\n\nA word about the inside of the purse: it IS deep.  I keep mine organized by keeping items of like kind in separate mesh bags with a zipper (makeup in one, tissues in one, pens and medicine in another, etc.) so I'm now able to avoid the incessant \"digging to the bottom of the Abyss\" problem I've had with deep purses before.  I also have to be aware that I have the tendency to carry WAY more stuff with a larger purse, so that's a consideration if you're like me in that respect.\n\nAll in all I am quite pleased with my new find.  I have a lot of confidence in a long- term relationship with this bag! ;-)\n\nThis item was purchased at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Versatile, Beautiful and Practical Bag", "unixReviewTime": 1454371200}

The colors in the picture reflect how it looks in real life. Th silver handles are really unique. I like how this bag can be worn as a shoulder bag, cross-body, or a backpack. The zipper pulls are high quality and sturdy. The zippers zip open easily. The leather-like accents look realistic and all the hardware to hook the strap to different parts of the bag are shiny and attractive. On the sides There are leather straps that hang down and a buckle at the bottom so that you can create a slouchy style. The strap does not extend all the way to the buckle unless the bag is scrunched up a bit. The lovely silver handles were wrapped in plastic to prevent scratches, however, it was difficult to get the plastic off the handles where the handles go inside the leather holder. I can't get all the plastic off, but managed to cut it away enough that it is not noticeable. Also, on the strap there are a few loose threads and a discoloration, however, these imperfections do not detract from the sturdiness of the bag.\n\nThe bag itself is 15 inches tall to the highest point and 14 inches wide. In terms of depth, it is flat. However, it can hold tons of items. There is one pocket on the back that is about 4.5in tall x 5.5in wide. On the inside, there are two open pockets, one 4in x 4in and the other also 4in x 4in but with extra fabric that could allow something thicker to be slipped in. There is also a single zip pocket on the inside that is 4in tall x 7in wide. The strap can be extended to 61in, not including the hooks and shortened to 32in not including the hooks.\n\nOverall, I am very pleased with the quality of this bag. It is very sturdy with thick canvas material and solid hardware. The colors are beautiful, it is extremely stylish, and it's great for holding a bunch of stuff. The few faults I did find did not take away from all the positives.\n\nI received this product at a discount for my honest review.", "summary": "Beautiful Bag!", "unixReviewTime": 1453248000}

However the more I use it the more familiar and easier it has become. I find it very difficult to feel and sense the release button. Also it can be difficult to release if the belt is on tight . Online video explaining how to cut size and used the Buckle would be extremely helpful. Since I have never seen or used a belt like this before better instructions in a video I'm sure it would be very helpful to many.

I may get a few more as gifts. There is nothing more frustrating than looking for a tool you think that doesn't exist- until you have this kit.\n\nI received a Top One Tech 45IN1 Precision Screwdriver Set Repair Tool Kit for iPad, iPhone, & Other Devices (45 IN 1A)~ at a discounted rate, tol share my experience and leave an honest review, which is what you are reading.", "summary": "Great for the geek~ or just about any tiny screw.", "unixReviewTime": 1451606400}

I do a lot of band sizings and replacements, battery changes, and minor repairs for myself and many friends.  I have accumulated a nice set of higher quality watch tools over the years, but when somebody asks me to come over and change a bunch of watch batteries for them, it's nice to have a small, easily portable, self contained kit that contains everything I'm likely to need.\n\nThe case back openers are the key to kits like this.  There are two basic ways watch backs come off.  They may be pry off backs, or they may be unscrew backs.  The screw back case opener in this kit is easy to adjust and work with.  The pry tool is just OK.  I actually prefer a pry tool made by Victorinox.  This is marketed under the Victorinox name and several other brand names.  I highly recommend obtaining one of those to supplement this kit.\n\nAnother essential supplementary item is a head mounted magnifier.  This will allow better vision for working on small or tiny things, and you will keep both hands free.\n\nThe rest of the included tools are good quality and are perfectly serviceable.  The case is zipper closure and i really nice.", "summary": "Really nice kit for basic watch repairs.", "unixReviewTime": 1526774400}

The outside heart has a row of .super crisp and clear Swarovski crystal elements that really accent the piece in the most beautiful way. I also love the way that the hearts connect to the chain. There is no flimsy latch to hold the hearts on it is actually holes in the side of the heart that connect the heart to the chain.\n\nOverall this piece has been my absolute favorite piece to date and I am so glad I was able to try this necklace at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "My favorite piece", "unixReviewTime": 1448150400}

The large is only slightly bigger than the medium, and the bust was still too small AND it is so short! I washed and dried it once (just like I do with the other dress weekly) and it comes down to my ankles. The patterned dress still drags the floor and is the perfect length.

We took measurements and used the size chart. She is 5'4, 125lbs and wears a size 3 jeans. Chart said size 6 so that's what we ordered. The fit is pretty good, the chest is a bit large for her, she is a B cup, but it's padded and shaped enough that it works. The length is good, just above the knee but not too short, appropriate for young teen and school dances. Material is good quality, color is nice but the rhinestones are a disaster. Right upon opening the dress up I saw multiple stones missing from the front chest and they weren't even in the packaging to sew back on. They are loosely sewn on with a very fine plastic thread and all in one run with no ties so if the thread breaks at all between beads it just unravels and they all start to fall off. When we carefully tried the dress on stones were falling off the sheer chest material and the bottom. I spent over 3 hours carefully sewing many many stones back on and trying to move some to even out the front where they were missing and we had no replacements. The snaps at the neckline are very cheap and sewn on. One fell off when trying to unsnap it and had to be sewn back on as well. Overall the dress is beautiful and my daughter loves it (now that I've fixed it) but for the price I was very disappointed with the beadwork and to have it just falling off like it did. Definitely not worth the price. Had I not fixed it myself it would have cost even more to have someone else fix it or we would have had even more stones falling off and the dress would be ruined. Next time we'll likely find a dress in person so we can inspect the quality.", "summary": "Horrible beadwork, stones fall off", "unixReviewTime": 1474588800}

The leather is the expected assolutamente calf leather with a soft, almost suede-like feel. Based on my MacBook's display, the color is nearly spot-on with the image in the product description, but due to the leather's characteristics it will develop a patina and gradually darken over time due to the leather's texture. The buckle is solid stainless steel with a lightly brushed texture for a matte appearance. Like the buckle, the tab is also solid, not rolled or stamped steel and the whole assembly is attached to the strap with a threaded steel pin as opposed to a springbar.\n\nThe holes are very well defined and accommodate the wide pin with no unnecessary force during adjustment unlike other brands. Stitching is straight and even, very well done, especially for the price with all edges of the leather finished evenly and with no separation. The retaining loops for the strap end are also equally heavy duty and should hold up over time. The looped ends for attachment for the watch are well done. They're not reinforced internally but are almost exactly 24mm wide and should accommodate up to a 2.4mm springbar with no issues. Finally, the padding is well done, giving the strap a third dimension but tapering gently toward the pin holes to make putting on and taking off your watch an easy affair.\n\nIf you plan to wear this with a cheap watch, it will elevate the overall look. on a more expensive watch, it will blend in nicely and maintain a luxury appearance. This band is only cheap in price as the appearance and build quality are well above what you'll pay for it. It easily equals the quality of other leather bands I've paid over $150 for. In fact, there's a brand in the US well known on Kickstarter, that shall remain unnamed, that sells this exact band for $150 as being for the Apple Watch.", "summary": "The best $20 leather watch strap you'll find", "unixReviewTime": 1446595200}

Three days end and it's starting to feel softer already.\n-Stitching seems good to my eye and think it adds to the look of the band.\n-The buckle may be large for some. I actually like the size of it on me, but it might look too large on a smaller wrist. It feels a little thin and thus far is my only concern with the band (not a big concern, but I am keeping an eye on it).\n\nI'll include some pictures to show what the buckle looks like when worn, as well as a close up of the stitching, etc.\n\nOverall, this seems well worth the price (both far cheaper and nicer looking than Apple's leather bands).

I've never gotten a belt in a metal box before. Cool. The belt looked just as I expected. Casual. Canvas. Brown. Manly. Arrrrhh. (wait, that sounds like a pirate... you know what I'm going for).\n\nAnyway, I tried it on. Feels great, slides through the belt loops just fine... and keeps sliding... more.. wait... this is too big. Ugh. This is possibly the perfect belt for me and it's too big. Great.\n\nI reached out to the seller not once but twice and waited a couple of weeks. No response. See, I had received a discount and didn't want to look a gift horse in the mouth (I'm not sure how that fits in here but it seems to work.. I'll go with it).\n\nSo, in the end, I returned the belt. It was necessary. Sometimes you just have to let go. Maybe I'll hear from the seller, maybe not. But I'll keep looking for a belt like this one from someone else. Maybe, just maybe, I'll find the one meant for me. Or my belly will get bigger and I'll buy this one again. Now where was that chocolate bar....\n\nUPDATE: The end has become a beginning. And a belt with no end has been replaced with one that fits. I received a response only days after this review was posted. I thank the good folks at BuyReal for not only getting back to me, but making it right. It seems my conclusion of no service was premature. It's a world market: such a small world, such a big earth. My journey continues. Without the chocalate. Now that's a crime.", "summary": "Really nice belt... in the end", "unixReviewTime": 1453507200}

When you order the belt, you'll receive a cool black tin box with the logo of the company on it, inside of which you'll find the coiled belt. It's definitely the coolest packaging for any belt I've received. It was a pretty pleasant surprise and made me feel like I was getting a premium item. However, plenty of things that aren't great can be packaged to seem better than they are. So how was the product itself?\n\nThis belt is a really great value! I was really impressed with its solid construction, especially for a mostly non-leather belt. The mid-section of the belt is a very thick, sturdy canvas that feels like it will hold up for a long time. It will take a few days of wearing the belt to break in the canvas so that is has a bit more give, as it's fairly rigid when brand new. I first ordered a belt that was a bit too small, but was able to arrange to return it so I could re-order a larger one. Be advised, if you are looking for a cloth belt because you want something that might stretch or give more than a leather belt, this is not the belt for you (probably a canvas belt would be the wrong choice). It's a strong belt that will not stretch.\n\nThe belt is also stylish and looks good with most men's pants. I've used it with jeans, chinos, khakis, and it looks great. The brown color tone seems to go pretty much with everything. I'm really happy with the belt and plan to keep wearing it for quite a while. I'm switching it every few days for a really nice 100% leather belt that I have and it seems to hold up pretty well in comparison.\n\nI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Fantastic stylish belt, highly recommended.", "unixReviewTime": 1452988800}

His current belt he has owned and worn nearly daily for the past ten years.  It is starting to get thin and worn in places. It was defiantly time for a new belt. I went with the reversible brown/black belt because my husband own two colors of boots black and brown. This way his belt can match which ever.\nHis main concern with a reversible belt was the durability of the pin in the middle of the belt buckle that swivels back and forth making the belt reversible. Many reversible belts just have a thin wire holding the belt buckle together. Over time with frequent twisting that wire breaks. This belt appears to have a heavy duty pin inside it that allows the belt buckle to twist from side to side making the belt reversible.\nTo reverse the belt you have to pull a little on the buckle then twist. Once the belt buckle is in place it then locks into place making the belt and buckle look seamless and not reversible. It also helps lock the buckle in place so it won't twist while wearing the belt. In addition to being highly functional the buckle has a beautiful rustic antique nickel look with just the right amount of shine making this an awesome looking belt.\nThe leather of the belt is a thick cut of good quality sturdy leather.  The black side of the belt is a beautiful flat black that shows the grain of the leather nicely. The black wraps around the edges of the belt. It looks amazing with a nice pair of jeans and a black sports coat. The brown side is a beautiful shade of brown also showing the grain of the leather. On the brown side there is a few spots were you can see the black along the edges, but it still looks nice.\nAfter handling this belt right out of the box my husbands noticed it turned his hands slightly black. He said that just like every new leather product it is best to spray it with a heavy-duty water repellent leather spray. This will protect and seal the leather so the color will not rub off. It will also condition and protect the leather. If the leather spray is used every few months it will condition and protect the leather and keeping it from drying and cracking. His secret to getting a leather belt to last ten years.\nI ordered this belt a few sizes bigger than my husbands pants size so that there would be some excess belt to tuck into his first belt loop because I think that looks nicer than belts that are too short. I felt the belt was very true to size. It fit well and looked very nice on my husband. When my son saw the belt he wanted one.  He is also a bit of a science and engineering nerd and nearly took the buckle apart to check quality of the pin inside the buckle that turns making the belt reversible. It apparently passed the test because he really liked the belt and is adamant that I get him one also.\nI received this product at a reduced price for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Amazing High Quality Durable Multi-Use Belt", "unixReviewTime": 1458345600}

The belt came in a nice tin gift box. My husband has a size 32 inch waist and I ordered the 36 inch belt and it fit perfect without having to make any adjustments.\n\nThis is a nice belt for the price and my husband was happy with my selection.  What he really likes about this reversible belt is the versatility in being able to switch from brown to black depending on what he is wearing on any given day.  The leather is was not as thick as I has hoped but still seems durable enough.  I have seen a few reviews regarding issues with the buckle, so far my husband has not experienced nay problems.  I guess the true test of time will show how well this buckle holds up.  As for now the belt looks good, the buckle work great and as advertised.  My son saw this belt and liked it and now I have to go and order another one.  I am happy with my purchase and would recommend to a friend.\n\nI have received this product free or at a discounted price in exchange for testing, inspecting and providing my honest and unbiased review. I received no other compensation for providing a fair, unbiased, and honest review.\n\n***UPDATE***  I am changing my rating and returning the belt.  After one month, the belt buckle snapped off.  I will say the seller has very good customer  service and was very prompt in replying to the issue, however I had just happened to return this belt to Amazon for a refund and ordered a different belt and within an hour had a response from  customer service to assist with the belt buckle.", "summary": "Like versatility in being able to switch from brown to black ***UPDATED review 4-14-16**", "unixReviewTime": 1458172800}

Not just credit cards, but those other pesky cards that get lost. Like my library card, or my AAA card. Now I have room for them all. I received this wallet in exchange for an honest review and I am so glad they picked me to review it!\nIf you're like me, you love the feel of real leather. You will get your leather fix with this wallet! All of the stitching is solid. No skips or \"skims\" on the edges. The snaps on the front and inside and the zipper on the inside are all well attached. One thing I really liked about this wallet is that it has 2 areas for paper money. I like to keep larger bills hidden away from prying eyes in the checkout line, so now it looks like I only have a few dollars.\nAnother bonus is that the interior snap keeps the rest of the wallet from falling open just because you need to get a couple bucks out of the bill slot. The snap keeps all your cards tucked away, again, from prying eyes. Saves you from having to refold the entire wallet every time you need some cash. And since we're talking prying eyes, they thoughtfully made the id window out of a dark mesh. You need to be up close to read what's behind there.\nSince I don't carry a lot of cards, I was able to put all those cards into this wallet. The card slots are all nicely \"tight\". You don't have to worry about your cards just falling out. You actually have to do a bit of tugging to get them out, which I like.  Behind the card/id area there are two handy slots.  I used one as a holder for an individually wrapped handy-wipe and an eyeglass cleaning wipe. Also, since I don't have an iPhone, I use the slot on the back of the wallet to hold my grocery list and coupons that I will need for that trip to the store. All of my cards and id, all of my cash (not like there's a lot), some coins, a handy-wipe and glasses wipe, and my grocery list and coupons all in one wallet. And I'm not straining to get it snapped! The two outer snaps give you the option of making the wallet tighter or looser, depending on how much stuff you want to stuff.\nThis is a very versatile and high quality wallet. Well worth the price of $37.99 as of writing this review. This is now my everyday wallet. Thank you Winkine for such a wonderful product!\n\n**EDITED 5/13/17**  This is still my everyday wallet. It has gotten a few scratches, a couple water spots, some minor wear marks, but those only add to the antique look! All of the zippers and slots are still showing no signs of giving out at the seams, etc. I still have some card slots double stacked with cards and the slots still hold the cards snugly.

And I have to say that my OCD is definitely kicking in. I just feel like there's a couple of words that are missing and it's kind of driving me crazy. The bottom line says 'Free Person At Time'. I guess that could make sense, but what I think it should say is free person at one time, or I was a free person at some time, there's just so many different ways that it could have been stamped into the leather. Its just driving me crazy. The top part says comfortable and free style, and then on the line under it it says in nature... Deep respiration. I don't even know what that means, in the context of using a bag I mean...  Underneath that in quotations is \"dailylife\". I just feel like there's a couple of key words that are missing in order for it to make sense for me.\n\nAs for the quality of the bag, the canvas is a nice thick canvas, the stitching is done really nicely. The hardware is also very nice, it's not a cheap plastic material. The elastic drawstrings is very heavy duty, and closes up the back very nicely. I like the magnetic button that is on the kind of flap of the bag.\n\nThere are plenty of pockets and lots of space that can be used for this bag. I definitely have an appreciation for the easily adjustable shoulder strap, I like that it's not a sin shoulder strap and also that it's not overly large. I would consider it to be the perfect medium size strap.\n\nI like everything about this bag except for the leather piece in front that has the print on it.

I give their customer service 5 stars.\n\nThe coat I give 3.5/4 stars I was not expecting great quality for the price but was pleasantly surprised at how well the coat held up. For those people who have never bought clothes directly from China be sure you check the sizing. It is significantly different from U.S sizing and although I bought this coat under the U.S sizing I have seen this coat on amazon using Chinese sizing so be sure you check. The coat actually ended up being a little big on me but that is my own fault. The reason I have given the coat lower marks are for the following reasons: 1) I loved the idea of the belt unfortunately it was very flimsy and of little use. I would suggest the belt be made of better material and quality that alone would make me buys this again; 2) I liked that the lining comes out and acts as another jacket, however there were no pockets, which I did not realize until I wore it by itself (I was in another country and had to pull out my passport a lot so I wanted deep pockets on the front so I could keep track of it...note the outer layer does have the pockets which was great but again the lining had none).

Maybe that's evident in pictures and descriptions, but I'm letting you know just in case. It's comfy, for sure, and offers a lot of coverage. I haven't yet tested it in the water because I'm going to return or exchange the bra I received because it is too big. I am a 34D; the sizing chart says I'd wear a large (39\" bust). After reading reviews, I thought a medium would fit better. Turns out that I may be best off with a small, and I think that might make sense because I'm petite, bust size aside, and I usually wear a small in women's clothing. The issue is that the band is super loose. That said, the bra conceals my large breasts, but *that* said, a smaller size wouldn't reveal anything. The medium size isn't giving me the compression I was hoping for, and maybe a smaller size would. My bathing suit gives me a lot of compression, so even if a small doesn't compress I may keep it because the bra is lightweight and gives a lot of coverage (and will, hopefully, still give me coverage in a small). I think the lesson is that the size chart is more applicable to band than bust size.\n\nEDIT: I exchanged the medium for a small. The band fits much better, and I still have a lot of coverage. But I'm noticing that after about five wears some of the stitching is coming loose. Maybe this is from the pull on/ pull off struggle over big breasts, or maybe this one out of thousands has a QC issue.

And for the people who complain that jewelry turns places green, I understand if it turns places green when it's suppose to be sterling silver, but thats only reason we should be upset, but if it just said silver ring or chain, then you just know it's a 50/50 on how it's going to hold up, one can't be that upset for price we paid. I know when I buy jewelry on here thats what to expect, it's the false advertising I have issues with. I will try to update after she gets and wears it. I will ask her to keep nots on day she received it and not that I am looking for it too, but if it does mess up to let me know and i will update.

The band does smell like leather and bend with no wrinkles nor did the band start cracking.  I will not think twice about ordering from this seller.  They have my business for life.  Attach are pictures of the band with my watch installed.\n\nDisclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for a discount in the hope that I would mention it on my review.
