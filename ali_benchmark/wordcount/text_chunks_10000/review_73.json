Obviously, it is form fitting, so beware of panty lines.\n\nThe way this dress is cut is extremely flattering.

Definitely no worries there, as this dress has become one of my favorite items in my closet! For ladies who are concerned about how this dress looks on, I highly recommend taking a chance. It's flattering even though it's form-fitting.

That indicates that they have had a lot of complaints and are avoiding returning people's money. If you want to pay for shipping to china, they'll let you. Well, thanks.\n\nThese are the reasons for the 3 star review. It's a shame, because the item is very nice and the service was prompt. But it's quite clear they have had complaints and just don't want to have to pay anyone back. Hoenstly, if they had an American XL (which would've been a large) I'd have paid to have it exchanged.\n\nIf you are a very slim western male with no muscle mass and saggy shoulders, OR you are asian, this coat might fit you as described. But don't waste your time otherwise.", "summary": "Nice item, misleading service.", "unixReviewTime": 1451779200}

This company ONLY wants 4 of 5 star ratings they don't care if their product is flawed or not as long as you give them 4 of 5 stars that is what matters to them.  Once I made them aware that is not how I will go about there final message was and I quote: Ok, we have refunded to you. Hope you can help us leave 4 or 5 stars.  Of course if I could I would give them -5 stars for this do not bully me for your ratings rather make sure your product is of good and above standard quality and you will be those ratings to but say half for a star is not good in any fashion of business.\n\nGot it and was like WOW this is awesome and it fit just a little snug but I prefer that don't have to worry about it falling off my finger but then after having it for about 3 weeks I took it off when I have to do some cleaning with chemicals and noticed that 2 small stones had fallen out...that really bummed me out as it was so pretty just hate that stones didn't stay.

I will update this review as I get more wear out of it. Pictures will be added later!\n\nFor reference, I am 5'5, 115 lbs, and 30C; I ordered a Medium instead of a Small based on the size guide in the description of this product (I HIGHLY recommend doing this when purchasing from a retailer you're unfamiliar with and who produce in other countries). I found that ordering a Medium instead of a Small was the PERFECT fit for my body type. Specifically in the bum department. So many rompers are too short for me and you can see too much booty for me to be comfortable walking around in.  Some things to note about the romper:\n\n-The straps are somewhat removable. Think of those bras that can convert into racer-backs and that's exactly what this outfit can do. It's designed to have the straps going racer and tank style to keep the large back gap as \"closed\" as possible. Though you can go full tank style or full racer, however, it will make the opening on the back billow much more.\n\n- There's this weird pointed edges right next to the loops where you can remove the straps. It's where the clothing was hemmed I think and I think it's too thick for the seamstress or sowing machines to attach the loops there. I wish they did because it would have made the back more ascetically pleasing. It's kind of noticeable and this kind of bothers me which is why I knocked off a star.\n\n-It's definitely a linen-like material which for me means it will need special care in the washer. Cold wash and air dry--no dryer unless you don't use heat.  I've only seen myself in this romper at night and in artificial light, but I'd have to say it's semi-see through. A backless bra or pasties or no bra (Go you!) will work just fine with this outfit.\n\nOverall, I'm pleasantly surprised that this romper fit! I'm excited to wear this out this summer. I love the back and how open it is. This romper is very roomy, but modest -- in the front. ;) As of right now, I highly recommend this to those looking for a summer romper or cover-up that also fully covers their bum!\n\n**I was NOT paid or discounted this item.

I really love this Threesixty360 Womens Classic Toggle Duffle Pea Check Hood with Coat, but as you can see in the video it is WAY TOO SMALL! The video includes first a look at the coat by itself and then a look at the coat on me. You'll see why I love it and why I'm so disappointed in the sizing. (In the very beginning of the video I said I chose a size medium, but I completely misspoke as I actually had ordered & received & was wearing an extra large!)\n\nI harp on the sizing in this written portion, but the video shows you all the great details about this coat that you don't want to miss if you can fit into it! Just for starters, the zipper closure goes to the neck which is fabulous!\n\nI always follow the guidelines put up by a seller for sizing and this one was way off.  If you look in the product photo area, there is a size chart and for the size I chose the largest available: XL and I was within parameters of the measurements given; they also said XL is comparable to size 16 to 18 which would be correct for me. For the black coat I was offered for review, I was not given the option of an XXL which might possibly have fit me better.\n\nI look like a stuffed sausage wearing this coat. They included a thin blue shell that you can see me wearing in the video. I felt it was extremely inappropriate to wear by the blue shell by itself as it is paper thin which is why I was hiding behind the coat in the video.. Since creating the video, I have since wondered if the seller's idea of a pea coat and mine are different as it is clearly made outside of the US. I see coats as something to put over clothes to keep warm. Maybe they see this as a fashion statement and not meant to be taken off?  I highly recommend you measure yourself over a set of clothes you want to wear underneath this coat for correct sizing!\n\nAnd keep in mind that this coat is a coat for Autumn or Spring- not for winter. It is so thin I'm sure the windy city would freeze me if it had fit and had I worn it out and about in Winter!\n\nI did not know what \"duffle\" meant in the name of the coat and so I looked on amazon to see if there were other duffle coats to understand if this contributed to my misunderstanding of how this coat would fit. In the video, you can see that the tags do not match the name Threexisty360. And I happened to find a coat with the same description as this one-looks very similar except hood lining is a different color and it has the same tags (with the same brand name) as is on my coat! You can see it here in a slightly different color:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Meaneor-Women-s-Classic-Toggle-Duffle-Pea-Coat-with-Hood-Wine-Red-XXL/dp/B015XNN2GC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Meaneor Women's Classic Toggle Duffle Pea Coat with Hood Wine Red XXL</a>&nbsp;I saw they had XXL which might've fit me better unless they were going on  different size chart. Anyhow-it is interesting information to have.\n\nI LOVE the look of this coat and feel SO frustrated that perhaps there is something that has been lost in translation as this coat was never meant to fit over clothes as . I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion. However! I am not happy to have paid the money I did to have the coat not fit.  I would be horrified if I were to pay the full price asked for and do not recommend you buy this coat at full price. I am going to donate this coat in hopes someone else can fit into it and enjoy it.  Three stars because it did not fit even though it has a lot of potential and is really cute.

I imagine you'd have less of an issue if you purchased black.  I do like it, though, but that's something to consider if going for the gray or wine color.  Personally, I needed something other than a black jacket.\n\nMaterials: There is no label, so I'm not sure if the materials in the listing are what I received  The outer material feels like a fleece, but without all the stretch.  The inner lining is your typical jacket inner lining, and the hood is a faux sheepskin like material.  Overall, it feels cheaper than a $199 list jacket (per the Amazon list price).\n\nSize: This is my biggest issue with this jacket.  As I mentioned earlier, I purchased a medium.  The tag on the jacket indicates I received a large.  A large would normally be huge on me, but I'm glad I got a large--even that was tight. It's very fitted, and I definitely couldn't wear anything bulky underneath! If you choose to purchase this, size up, then size up again.  Consider going one more if you ever want to wear a sweater! However, I'm not sure if the medium I ordered is a large based on the origin outside of US sizing, so it's really hard to say whether or not the size I received was a mistake.\n\nJust to add some things not fully mentioned--the jacket zips up to close, and has three cute, oversized buttons which add a fun detail. It also has two pockets in the front.  It also has a hood. I do like the style, and think it's a good looking jacket.  It's not super thick, and is good for fall where I live (Michigan), but is definitely not a winter jacket.\n\nI received this jacket at a discounted rate of $39.99 in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are 100% my own.  I do feel this jacket is worth the value I paid, though I would have been disappointed at the full price.  I also want to comment on the packaging--this came with a sheer tank (mine was in yellow), a cute polka dot hair tie with a knot/bow, and a regular hair tie with a charm.  I do appreciate extras, and think that's a nice thing from the seller.  However, I'm not sure if these are the norm or because of my agreement to review.", "summary": "Runs very small.", "unixReviewTime": 1446854400}

I'm tall 5'8\" and I wanted to make sure it would be long enough to cover my backside and that the sleeves wouldn't hit me in a weird spot. The large fits perfectly.

I was a little perplexed with the online image and wondered how true it was to the actual earrings. It turns out the online image is pretty accurate and not exaggerated at all. The brown mother of pearl reflects different colors depending on the light; brown, peach, rose, green, clear and even a tad bit of grey. In addition, each color that it reflects also comes in various hues. The brown for example, is not uniform...The brown is lighter in some parts and darker in others. Its a truly spectacular mlange of reflections that coordinate beautifully with each other. The rose gold plating is a perfect match for this pair that predominantly lets out brown and peachy hues.  These earrings are versatile in that they willl go with any color you want to wear. They also look dressy enough for a classy event yet can also be worn in a casual setting. While KS' famous signature Danielle earrings come to 2.5 inches, the Alex earrings come a little shorter to around 1.75 inches (including the top-most part of the hook). They are overall very sturdy and well-crafted. Unlike the Danielle earrings that are a bit heavy, the Alex earrings are rather light and far more comfortable and feasible for ladies with sensitive ears. If you like brown mother of pearl and classy earrings and you're looking for something lighter than the Danielle earrings, you will love these. Lastly, the packaging was a sight to behold. They were beautifully wrapped in the popular KS sky blue pouch and then also bubble-wrapped for extra protection. I was excited like a little child to unwrap each pair of exquisitely packaged KS earrings. 5 stars.", "summary": "Yet another gorgeous pair from KS", "unixReviewTime": 1480118400}

I've been lugging my Phantom around in the original box it came in. While the box is totally serviceable, it's a pain to use and (of course) not very durable. The problem was that I didn't want to spend $200 or more on a hardshell case.\n\nMy needs were this:\n\n1) I wanted a hardshell case mostly for personal transportation. That is, I wasn't planning on entrusting this case to baggage handling machines or other people. I wanted a case I felt comfortable putting in my car, taking to the park or on long road trips, etc. If you want a \"bombproof\" case, you need to think about the $200 Pelican style cases.\n\n2) I wanted precut foam that was tightly fitted.\n\n3) I wanted travel/carry options.\n\nThe Cheerwing checks all those boxes.\n\nSHELL:\n\nThe outer plastic shell is certainly not bombproof like a Pelican case. It's thin, cheap plastic. But I don't need something that can bounce off the top off an expedition vehicle, down a rocky crag, and into a hippo-infested river. I'm a suburban dad, not a Nat Geo explorer. This case is sufficient to withstand light drops, luggage shifting onto it, kids kicking, rain, and all the normal daily hazards that most of us face.\n\nThe case is significantly better than cardboard and sturdier than a softshell case. It provides good everyday protection for your drone. As one other reviewer noted, the shell comes with a plastic film. Mine came torn up a little and it made the case look like it had been damaged in shipping. No biggie to me because I knew the case was going to get scratched up pretty quickly like all my other hardshell cases have (after all, that'd kind of the point of having a hardshell case: they take abuse). Remove the film and you get a glossy faux carbon-fiber look\n\nThe zipper pull feels sturdy, and I haven't had any hitches with them.\n\nFOAM:\n\nThe interior foam is low quality, but as it's primary job is crush-resistance I think it's fine. A softer foam would have offered more impact-absorption, but you have to keep in mind that a foam insert for a Pelican case of this size would cost almost as much as the entire Cheerwing backpack. So, keep in mind that this backpack is better suited towards crush-resistance. If you plan to throw your drone case around a lot 1) you are madman, and 2) you should buy a more expensive case with impact-absorbing foam.\n\nI found the foam cutouts to be perfectly acceptable. Everything slotted in just fine and the case closed up easily.\n\nThe one thing I didn't like is that the top foam piece in my case is loose, so it occasionally comes out. This isn't a big deal, but it surprised me a little. If I end up finding it really annoying, I'm pretty sure I can just glue or velcro tape that piece in.\n\nTRAVEL:\n\nThe top handle seems to be stitched in well and makes it easy to pick up and move the case. When I pack my drone away for a bit, the top handle make it easy to hang the drone from a hook or to carabineer it onto a closet rod. The back straps leave a little to be desired as they are very basic straps.\n\nThis is a \"prop-off\" case. You need to remove props or prop-guard before you put your drone in it. The upside of that is the case has smaller dimensions than prop-on cases. In fact, when you combine the thinner plastic, cheaper foam, and smaller dimensions, the case is surprisingly light. The light and compact design are great for everyday use taking your drone to the park or packing into the minivan with all your vacation luggage.\n\nOverall, I really like this backpack. I would have liked slightly better backpack straps, but this otherwise is a great value. I honestly think will provide ample protection for the vast majority of situations most of us face when we travel with our drones. That being said, if you're going on an expedition (or your thinking about entrusting your expensive drone to an airline luggage system), you might want to upgrade to a more expensive and rugged case.", "summary": "If you don't need a bombproof case, this is the one for you!", "unixReviewTime": 1469059200}

It up scales my Sport Watch very nicely. I needed to remove four links for a correct fit and the included tool made doing so, a snap. You just insert the pointed end in one of the holes at the side of a link. There are spring posts in each removable link. Gently press a little bit and you'll be able to release and remove a link. Then to join the links again, align one end then use the tool to press down the other pin and slide the links together until they click shut. This is about as easy as a removable link band gets to adjust. The butterfly latch is very easy to use, to remove and attach the watch.\n\nIt looks fantastic with my Space Gray Watch. The surface has a semi-matte shine with very little glare. It also seems to take on body temperature and not be cold to the touch. When you run your fingers over the surface it has a unique texture, it's not smooth as much as it feels like paper. Very unusual and very interesting. I love the difference from typical bands I'm used to. I'm very impressed and think you will be too. It's a stunner and also comes beautifully packaged for gifting.\n\nThis product was provided at or nearly no cost for the purpose of evaluation and review.", "summary": "A stunner, a beautiful upgrade for any Apple Watch", "unixReviewTime": 1469836800}

I'm usually not one to change out that particular piercing and have stuck to the original one I have but I'm so happy I decided to give this a try. Buying industrial piercings can be tricky. I've had this piercing for nearly ten years and in time have forgotten my gauge so it was a bit of a tossup as to whether it'd fit and luckily for me, it did. Also don't forget about then length of your piercing. It's not easy to measure but it's doable otherwise it might not be long enough. Also it is not suggested to change them out until it is healed. I know the temptation for switching piercings but it's really not worth it.\n\nThe jewelry itself is great. Each ball unscrews so you can insert it which isn't my favorite as it can be a bit tricky and takes longer than my other but in time I'm sure I'll get used to it. Honestly I wanted to give it five stars and debated it but the only reason I didn't was because one of the balls won't show the diamond if you screw it as tight as you can. It was a bit misleading in the picture in that sense as you obviously assume both with show. I'm keeping it anyways and will just make sure the one that won't show is on my hairline since that one is difficult to see anyways so it's not a big deal for me. I tried to not screw it tight but it's just too loose to make me comfortable that I won't lose the ball. I've had that happen and it can be a pain to replace and in this case, since it's a more specialized one, I'd have to order it a second time so leaving it partially unscrewed isn't an option. The only other problem I can see someone running into is the actually diamond logo touches the helix, the outside/top portion, of my ear. I don't plan on wearing this consistently but if I did then I imagine the rubbing might irritate it.

This shirt had a few \"mislabels\" eg. the brand name was not \"J. TOMSON\" as in the picture but instead it was \"WAX JEAN\".  This doesn't matter much since both labels are not well known.  The other mislabel was inside where it says the shirt is 100% cotton.  The description on amazon says its about 70% cotton and 30% lyocell (which i prefer).  The lyocell mix will reduce the shrinkage and reduce wrinkling.  The actual shirt fabric has some north south stretch so i am inclined to think that the label on the actual shirt is wrong.  I am very happy with the shirt otherwise and love the comfortable fit.  I would recommend sizing up because the shoulder seam in the back will feel a bit snug if you have average to wide shoulders.  I just ordered a few more of these shirts in different colors because i think I'll get a lot of wear over spring and summer.  UPDATE: washes like 100% cotton.

I have a small head, so I tighten it as far as it would go, and it fits perfect.  It gives 360 degrees comprehensive protection,resist UV damage, has a removeable side curtain allows ventilation and is comfortable,and fast drying. It comes with a face mask which you attach with velcro, however it attaches pretty high up towards the bridge of your nose.  So, if you want full face protection, this is great for you, but if you want it down lower on your nose, towards the tip, you will have to attach it with safety pins. There is also another piece  which protects your neck from the sun and bugs  which you attach/detach with hooks which make it easy to put on/take off.\nOverall, I am very happy with this product and think it is a good value for under $16.

If it is too loose there is an elastic cord with a plastic stopper at the back of the hat on the outside to tighten the hat.  If you have a larger head I think it may be a bit tight since there is no way of extending the size.\n- I really like the lightweight breathable material that was used on this product.\n- I like  the versatility of the hat.  You can wear it as just a regular hat, you can pull up the sides and secure them with the snaps or you can add on the other pieces to help protect your neck from the sun and other elements or add on the face guard to help protect from dust, sand and dirt.  I like the use of the hooks which make it easy to attach and remove the back piece.  If you want to add the face guard on while you have the hat on it is a little challenging since it attaches using Velcro which is placed on the inside brim of the hat.\n- I like that the under chin strap.  Do note that it is not removable.  I like that the strap has a plastic stopper to help secure the strap under your chin with a separate bead used as a stopper to ensure that it doesnt come off.\n\nI like the More Than Trade Womens Wide Brim Hat.

If one does break it would be pretty simple to use a safety pin or some thread to attach the two together.\nThe face shield is not as well designed, the Velcro tabs to attach it are a little too far back and it keeps that piece too high on her face, right at the bottom of her eyelids making it uncomfortable to wear, she said that if the Velcro pieces were double their length or if the face piece ends were just a little longer it would be perfect as it needs some more room for adjustment, \"reason for dropping one star\".\n\nOtherwise she really likes the hat, ventilation around the top is excellent and it's not too heavy.

The bottom flap of the cardigan is hemmed along the edge with no fringe, and is sewn to the top near the inside of the opposite shoulder. The fringed side is a raw edge with the fringe knotted, which crisscrosses to the opposite shoulder and stays in place with a button. You wouldn't be able to really wear this as an open cardigan, as the one side is sewn in place. The bottom portion and sleeve \"cuffs\" are hemmed, and the top is raw.\n\nI've seen a very similar top advertised on a popular styling service and I've also seen this style popping up in my friend's social media feed for a lot more than here, so I am really glad I found it here for considerably less.

I suppose that is ok, as its just hat. However, thats not the whole truth as it is a little more complex than your average hat. There are two separate pieces of fabric. The first shades the back of your head/neck and attaches to the hat with clips. The other shades the front of your face and attaches to the hat via two pieces of Velcro. The hat, along with these two pieces of fabric do a very good job of shading your face/neck from the sun. In the photographed picture, the hat almost looks cheesy. It looks like something the samurai would wear when they go fishing. I presumed that the hat would be a lower quality, due to the funny look of the hat (as pictured). That is not the case, the material feels nice, exactly like the material that was used in one of my other top of the line outdoor hats. In person, the quality is apparent.\n\nIn summary, this item is a great buy for the money. For people that spend a lot of time outdoors, in the sun, its worth the price several times over.

There are two types of UV radiation:\n Ultraviolet A (UVA). UVA radiation is able to pass through glass and may cause premature aging and wrinkling of the skin. Research suggests that UVA may also play a role in causing basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma.\n Ultraviolet B (UVB). UVB radiation is more closely linked with the development of skin cancer and melanoma. UVB radiation causes sunburn and does not penetrate through car windows or other types of glass.\nIt is important to protect your skin from both UVA and UVB radiation.\nOther sun protection tips\n Limit sun exposure between 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM, when the sun's rays are the most intense. Practice the shadow rule: if your shadow is shorter than you, you should find shade.\n Pay attention to the UV index, which is often included in the weather report. This index is a relative measure of how damaging exposure to the sun will be on any particular day. The index is a scale of 1 to 10+. When the index is 10 or higher, people should stay indoors, if possible.\n Be careful around water, snow, or sand. These surfaces reflect the damaging rays of the sun, increasing your risk of getting sunburned.\n Wear a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, and a hat that shades the face, neck, and ears. Dark clothing with tightly woven fabric blocks more sun than white or loosely woven fabrics. For additional protection, look for clothing made with special sun-protective materials.\n Wear sunglasses with 99% to 100% UV absorption. They will provide optimal protection for the eyes and the surrounding skin.\n Be even more cautious if you are taking medications that may make you more sensitive to the sun. These include specific types of antibiotics, anti-inflammatories, antifungals, blood pressure medications, and chemotherapies.\n Keep babies younger than 6 months old completely covered and in the shade.\nNOW ABOUT THIS PRODUCT;\n360 degrees sun protection, very lightweight and fast drying material, excellent to go on Hiking short/long trips, believe me the sun gets brutal sometimes and this protection cap will do its job in protecting you from direct exposure, therefore helping you be more at ease when hiking in sunny days we just went to claim the Picacho del Diable peak in Baja (tallest mountain in Baja Mexico +10,000 ft) a 5 days trip, the last one in particular in the Laguna Salada (desert), and this Cap sure help a lot during that 112degrees dayit really dries fast and the 360 degree protection  made a difference.the front breathable mesh lest you breath easily in those dusty trails.for that and many more thingsI recommend this productso enjoy\nThis is my first impression of, and limited experience with, the product.

Based on the pictures I thought the material was going to be softer and more knit, but in person it is harder and more stiff. It isn't bad though, and is thick and of nice quality. The fringe is super cute and knotted tightly so I'm not worried about those coming undone or anything.\nI am 5'4, 125 pounds and a 34D bust for reference and I purchased this in a medium. It fits, however it is a bit tight on my shoulders. This makes it slightly uncomfortable and a little difficult to get on and off. If you normally order a medium, It might be beneficial to order up a size. However, because it fits everywhere else and is the perfect length for my height Im not sure ordering up a size would have helped me. I also noticed there is a slight tear on the inside of my poncho, and I saw this before trying it on. If that tear rips more, The one side of the poncho will completely come off. However, it is an easy fix so I'm not really concerned about it.\nOverall, I gave this 4 instead of 3 stars because it is really cute and I will wear it in the future. I just had higher hopes for it based on the price and pictures. Also, it shipped really fast, my expected delivery date was November 27th and it is November 9th.\nI received at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion.", "summary": "I had higher expectations but it is still really cute", "unixReviewTime": 1447027200}

I've worn it one day and there are 3 snags that have been pulled up from the teeth not giving a \"clean release\". Along with that comes the fact that I can't get it off in one motion, I have to open it up, pull it tighter (to clear any of the belt fabric from the teeth) and then pull the belt off... So far, it has been a hassle. I blame the teeth, if it had a flat bar across to grip instead it probably wouldn't snag on the belt fabric.

It just looked so beautiful and elegant. Unfortunately, the sizing charts they offer on the page for this are not for tops, but I used my best judgment. I got this item quickly and knew it was a 50/50 whether it would fit or not according to the other reviews. When I opened the packaging, I was really excited. The item itself is really beautiful. There's a ton of detail and it looks great in person. Unfortunately, the top did not fit correctly. In my case, the chest and waist fit perfectly but it was too tight around the arms and shoulders. I am disappointed that it didn't fit and am returning it tomorrow. I did contact the seller and requested an accurate sizing chart for their tops. I'm seriously considering ordering another in the next size up because I really think for the price, it's a gorgeous cover-up. I will admit there are a few stray threads that were left poking out of the jacket but nothing that couldn't be trimmed easily. The material was also a bit more scratchy than I expected it to be. Although, seeing as it's made of tulle, sequins, and beads, I suppose it makes sense. It's definitely wearable for one day. I would recommend this item for a very pretty and inexpensive way to add a little more coverage to your wedding dress, but I'd strongly suggest contacting the seller to get an accurate sizing chart so you don't waste money returning the wrong size!", "summary": "Very pretty and detailed topper!", "unixReviewTime": 1465344000}

Upon opening the item I saw that it was technically a hoodie, just basically a long sleeved t-shirt with a hood on it. Still technically counts, but not the sort of hoodie I've grown accustomed to.\n\nThe biggest issue is the decal. It does have the piston on it with the phrase. But it is faded, wrinkled and cheap looking. The letters and piston are not individually ironed on, it is one single decal and the space in between the letters is very noticeable. It looks like something you'd make at home for a third of the price. They also list this as 80% cotton, 20%# polyester. Pretty sure this is BS. There's no tag inside the hoodie, however.

There were no loose strings falling off this shirt.\n\nThe bad: Despite following the sizing guide, I still felt this shirt was a bit too tight. The material is very clingy, meaning that all of your flaws are on full display. The material is also very thin, and somewhat see through. You pretty much HAVE to wear something underneath this shirt, which is bothersome because of how this runs small.

I like the color scheme and they look warm and cozy, like a log cabin. The problem is that for the price, they are poorly made and tear easily. I had returned my first pair of pants because they arrived with a tear in them. The tear was located on the front thigh area.\n\nI returned those and ordered a second pair. I was pretty excited, since its starting to get a little chilly, a rarity in Miami, and I immediately put my pants on as soon as they arrived. As I was walking around in my house, the pocket snagged on a closet handle and lightly tugged on the pocket. The pants ripped instantly from the pocket all the way the way to my behind. Seriously, it was instantaneous, no resistance at all, and it really was the smallest tug. I showed them to my wife, and after a few laughs, she looked over the pants and told me that the stitching was poorly done.\n\nSo here I sit, writing a two star review and I'm pretty upset. I have purchased flannel pants like these from other stores and they have lasted me forever. I would wear them out and they could withstand some light wear and tear, these however are very fragile. Be sure to use them only for some pictures and then immediately take them off and place them back in storage.\n\nOne of the other reviewers mentioned that they feel cheap, while they don't feel cheap, you can tell that somethings off when you wear them. It's like between cheap and okay. I also agree with the other reviewer that stated that the pants were very light. I don't think they would do a good job at keeping someone warm in the cold.\n\nPictures attached, please don't laugh at my white Casper like legs.

I cook, grill, and smoke a lot. I have used a wireless smoker/bbq thermometer for some time now, but I always find myself having to run back and forth to the kitchen to check on the meat that I put in the oven to finish it. This solves that!\n\nUpon unboxing I installed four AAA batteries (two in the transmitter, two in the receiver) and it immediately connected wireless. No programming it, no pressing buttons until the transmitter and receiver found each other - just plug and play. The temperature transmits reliably throughout my house and on my back patio, which is where I intend to use it the most. I don't know the exact range, but it is obviously longer than I need - I suppose I can now check the temperature on my pork butt or roast from my neighbors house if I'd like to.\n\nYou can select the type of meat and it automatically selects an appropriate temperature to alert on. From there you can set the level of doneness. In the case of beef the preset values are a bit higher than I like (136F Rare, 145F Medium Rare, 162F Medium, 171F Well Done), but that's of no consequence - press the \"Set\" button and pick any temperature you'd like!\n\nThe receiver has a built in kick stand and belt clip, so whether you want to set it up next to you while you relax on the patio or by the pool or clip it to your belt while you are on the move, you've got options that will work for you.\n\nI'm very pleased and expect to get a great deal of use out of this wireless thermometer. If you haven't used one before, you are missing out on a level of convenience that wasn't possible 10 or 15 years ago (at least not at an affordable price point like this).\n\nThis product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. Even so, I do my best to be fair and honest in my reviews. As you can see from my profile, not every item gets five stars, and I bring up shortcomings in items as I find them. I do try to exercise some care in selecting items to buy, even when they are provided at a discount, based on other reviews and existing product knowledge - if I suspect that an item won't be good, I don't buy it in the first place.", "summary": "Exactly what I wanted to provide wireless flexibility while cooking!", "unixReviewTime": 1468800000}

I tend to dress in darker colors and the grays bled in perfectly with my wardrobe.  I am always reluctant to order clothing online.  I am a plus size woman and I find that I need to try almost everything on to make sure it fits in all the right places.  This wrap was one size fits all so I thought I would give it a try.\n\nWhen it came I couldn't believe how well it was packaged.  It was in a mailing envelope, inside a nice zipper top plastic bag, inside a second zipper  top plastic bag with vents and it had a reusable bag with it that I assume would be the stores bag.  That bag is bright white with lovely printing on the front.  My grandson immediately latched onto that bag and started putting his story books into it to carry around.  Even though I loved it I think I have lost that shopping bag.  There was also a nice little ornament included with the wrap.  I thought that was a lovely, kind gesture.\n\nThe wrap itself is beautiful.  It is very soft.  So soft that I just wanted to snuggle down into it when I put it on.  I love the fact that there are no actual sleeves.  There are slits that you put your arms through.  I suffer from sever heat intolerance due to a chronic illness so the no sleeve aspect is very appealing to me.  My body often times is cool but my extremities and face are very warm.  This will be the perfect fall wrap for me with my condition.\n\nBeing a plus size woman the wrap is a little smaller than I would have liked it to be.  It does fit me and I can wear it but I would have liked a little more fabric.  It will fit most women perfectly as a one size fits all.  If you are a very small woman it might seem that you have excess fabric but that just means you can really snuggle up within its extra soft cashmere fabric.\n\nI did not receive any care instructions with my cashmere wrap and since I am not familiar with cashmere I will definitely be researching how to properly launder this beautiful wrap.

Its Very short so its not meant to be worn outside, its for cosplay or as a lingerie piece. I picked the red version, the colors are nice and bright.\nWhat I didn't do before ordering is read the listing, turns out I should have. Its \"free size\" which usually means XS-M, in this case, its more M-XL. Its a wrap skirt with no closure (no zipper or button), it has a long strip of velcro instead. This could be an advantage, it will accommodate several different body shapes, but it also means that if you're smaller, it may be too large for you.\n\nFor reference I am size S at 5'7\", 115lb, my hips are 33\" and my waist is 25.5\".\nThe skirt is supposed to sit on your hips, not your waist, the listing says that its best for 33\"-40\".\nThe measurements are 8.8\" in length and the velcro stretches from about 32\" to 39\" in hips (so the listing is basically correct). If your hips are between 32\" and 35\", there will be a strip of velcro sticking out, it looks kind of awkward actually, im gonna add pictures of me wearing it so you can see for yourself. I supposed it could be cut but then you would have to fix the edges, not sure if its worth the effort.\n\nPersonally I like skirts a bit loose so I don't mind the velcro issue, overall I think it deserves the 5 stars, as long as you know that it's best for approx M-L in hips.", "summary": "Looks great, best for M-L", "unixReviewTime": 1464912000}

I did take it off to wash my dishes because I do that with every ring but it's fine with hand washing.\n\nMy ring has no missing stones and they all look secure in the setting with no raised prongs to snag anything. The aquamarine gemstone is stunning to me. I love the way the light dances around the cut of the stone. The little diamonds are so shiny and they sparkle even under my office light the combination is eye catching and perfect to me.

While doing that I found the stitching wasn't much better than mine at absolute beginner level (had never used a sewing machine before).\n\nPros of the dress: cute, nice color\nCons of the dress: obnoxiously small, cheaply made, inconsistent between dresses (a couple of the dresses had totally different lace patterns/colors), stiff/cheap zipper, way more suffering than it's worth.\n\nIf you insist on ordering this (or requiring it) make sure you order at least 2 sizes up to begin with and order it way in advance so you can replace it if you need to.\n\nP.S. My photo is from AFTER I altered it by replacing the lining", "summary": "DON'T BUY THIS DRESS!", "unixReviewTime": 1503532800}

This AmorWing Tibetan OM Bead Tiger Eye Prayer Mala Bracelet is an excellent item.\n\nOne can note in the description of other prayer beads the emphasis on beauty.  Some people may view mala beads as jewelry.  These prayer beads are certainly very attractive.  That is a nice plus.  However, the two characteristics which are significant to me are durability and functionality.  I purchased this bracelet because they are prayer beads.\n\nI wear these beads daily, and nightly.  I have purchased much less expensive mala beads in the past, but they do not hold up to the wear very well.  Going on two months of constant use, these beads have held up very well.  I will report back after six months on that issue.\n\nA second essential is functionality.  One can pray and keep track of his/her number of recitations by feel, and not need sight.  This is permitted by the very large bead in the center of the prayer beads.  This permits a person to pray at night, in the dark, driving or when they cannot visually follow their progress.  This is not possible with the design of some other mala beads.  The extra large bead in the center is therefore a must.\n\nThe bracelet allows a person to have the mala beads with them all the time.  This is not the case with other prayer beads such as a Anglican or Catholic rosary, or a 108 count meditation bead, which one needs to carry in, and possibly forget putting in, a pocket or purse.\n\nAs an aside, I will mention that I was questioned about the prayer bead bracelet only once, and that was when a Vietnamese lady inquired if I wore it for good luck.  I did not explain further but told her that it was not a talisman.\n\nI wish that AmorWing would translate the writing on the main, large bead in its description.  I still have not found a translation.\n\nThe AmorWing Tibetan OM Bead Tiger Eye Prayer Mala Bracelet is an excellent prayer bracelet and worth the price from my perspective.", "summary": "Excellent Prayer Beads", "unixReviewTime": 1457740800}

Another simple improvement (worth at least one star) is to have snaps at the crotch.\n\nHandy tip:  To reduce strain on the material / snaps, use your finger nails to separate the snaps instead of pulling on the material.

I find fits well the nylon/ spandex allows the bra to hug my bust just perfectly. The 3 row of hook and eye gives me great security and comfort. The straps are a little wider than traditional bras which is always a plus. The only flaw I've found is the straps are placed to far apart.

I wanted the bra to give support while still have a pretty, modern look.\n\nMerchandise: The bra arrived in secure packaging inside a plastic re-sealable bag.  I received the beige bra. The bra has two front snaps to allow the bra to open in order to nurse. The clips are easy to use. The bra also has removable foam inserts.\n\nThe Good: My favorite attribute about bra is the adjustable straps.  The straps allow for great coverage and comfort, as it distributes the weight over my shoulders.  I also like that I could adjust the strap length and the overall circumference of the bra, due to the back extenders. I am a 36 circumference and I ordered a Large. The bra fit as expected  if anything, I would say I fell on the too small side rather than the too large. Therefore, if you are between sizes, I recommend going up a size.\n\nThe Not-So-Good: The bra straps seem to be wide set, which if not tightened correctly, can cause the strap to fall down on my shoulder.\n\nMy Recommendation: Overall, this bra is exactly what I expected. It is comfortable and a great bra to wear throughout the night. Although finding a size can be tricky, the size I bought fit nicely and I was able to further dial in my size by using the adjustable straps and back extender. I would recommend this bra to a friend.\n\nI have been lucky enough to be selected to review this product at discount in exchange for an honest review.

I was hesitant to order a nursing bra online, but after zero luck trying on maternity bras in the store I decided to give this one a shot. The bras I tried on in the store were ok, but not super comfortable. I have been having a rash like pain on my bra line that the doctor indicated was from nerves stretching to their limit. He advised trying a sports bra to help alleviate the discomfort. When this bra arrived (and super fast thanks to amazon prime), I was so excited to try it on immediately. The bottom of the bra is stretchy and fits similar to a sports bra. I was very surprised at how comfortable the bra was initially, but mostly was thrilled that it really did eliminate my discomfort at the bra line! I have worn this now a few times and have still been very pleased with how comfortable this bra is. As with many nursing bras, it has the hook to make one handed unhooking for breastfeeding much easier. Also, the fabric has just the right amount of padding and a spot for nursing pads. Overall, I am very happy with this nursing bra, especially for the price! More comfortable and less expensive than those I tried on in the store!\n\nI received this product at a discount in exchange for my HONEST review.", "summary": "Very happy with this nursing bra!", "unixReviewTime": 1458259200}

I nursed my three year old for twenty-six months and still going strong with my eight month old.  I have had a hard time finding nursing bras I like.  The ones I have used had underwire in them or a hard piece on the side that always dug into me.  A comfortable bra is a necessity whether you are nursing or not.\n\nFor the price, I figured this bra was worth trying.  I ordered the L. I am normally a 38C in nursing bras.  The straps are wider than I am used to.  Most of my bras have a skinnier strap.  The usual clasp setting I would put it on at the back of the bra did not work for this one.  I had to try another one.  Once I got the straps figured out, I had no problem wearing it the rest of the day and it was quite comfortable. I am a few days in using the bra and quite happy.\n\nIt hooks and unhooks easily for nursing.  The last thing you want to do is mess with a difficult clasp when wrangling a fussy baby.  It comes with removeable pads.  The opening is at the top instead of the sides with most bras.  They were easy to remove and move around. I found the bra to be supportive and comfortable.\n\nOnly con is that the pads sometimes move or get flipped over.  It is an easy fix, but has happened a couple times.  If they annoy you, they are easy to remove.\n\nI received this product at a discount or free for my unbiased review.

My first purchase of zipper-pull end closures was a design that accommodates two 1/8\" cords through a hole in the hinge, then compresses them between rows of ridges.  Those pulls were too small for any of the cord that I have.  I've got about 10 varieties of 1/8 cord, which I believe to be all in standard sizes.  None of them fit the clasps I first tried.  It was possible to compress the tab far enough to get the clasp to engage but doing so damaged the clasp.\n\nOut of desperation, I decided to try some other zipper-pull closure designs and gave these a try.  What a difference!  It's a bit challenging to get these open but that's generally a Good Thing since it means they will stay closed once assembled.  The trick to opening them is to put a bit of tension on the hinge while pushing the clasp free.  Once it comes loose you'll need to keep tension on the hinge until you get the other clasp free, then it opens right up.\n\nOnce open, slip the cord in and close the clasp on it.  I didn't think it would close due to the extremely small amount of clearance but it did and it's near impossible to pull the clasp off once locked.  On one of my tests, I managed to damage the shroud on the cord before the clasp pulled free.  That's a good hold.\n\nIn short it was a bit difficult to open but extremely easy to close securely.

I spent about 3 hours wearing this set last night and got a tooon of compliments (we went to a club), guys couldn't take their eyes off me and the girls all thought it was beautiful. My husband had to help me lace it up because the metal facets in the front are very rigid and hard to do up if the lacings are already tightened, but once someone has gone through and tightened everything it fits snug and stays that way. It was vaguely hard to breathe all night long, but it definitely kept the girls pushed up and secure. I am normally a size 8, usually a medium top because of my breast size (32K) and I ordered an XXL. The skirt fit perfectly and sat about midway down my thighs and fully tightened the corset fit just like it was supposed to. I danced, bumped and grinded all night in it and it held up very well so I wouldn't worry about the quality of it with normal wear and tear...though I wouldn't expect it to hold up well to washing.

I give the shirt 3 stars but that may be stretching it as well. The shirt is not officially licensed as it states in the description.  The one I received had zero tags on it and the care tag had been cut, leaving only the manufacturer label which is in Chinese.  The shirt fits great though and feels awesome; wasn't too loose or too tight.  I ordered large (5'11, 195#). The image was laughable.  It seriously looked like they ran it through an inkjet printer.  The front image was streaked with grey, light purple and blue and is difficult to tell what it is supposed to say.  The back image was white and quite legible but it looked as though they made a print setup error causing a mirror-image outline which was offset to the right. In short, the design was poorly crafted.  Not one to be thrown off by someone's misgivings, I was able to remedy the back image issue and I can live with the puke-ish front image.  However if you're one who expects what the description lays out, then avoid this.  Probably best to avoid this seller as well; I waited 33 days for this (it was Prime,ordered 9/26...it never left China until 10/19, a day after I was told that it would arrive!!)", "summary": "The shirt fits great though and feels awesome", "unixReviewTime": 1477958400}

This belt completely eliminates the prong and belt holes. Instead, it offers a ratchet system, which lines the inside of the belt and locks into place once engaged in the buckle.

You're no longer restricted to using punched holes every 1/4\" or more apart.\n\nThis particular belt is defaulted to 48\". The inside ratchet rail is probably about 8-12 inches in length. My husband is a 40\" waist and the belt fits fine. Any excess belt through the buckle is slid through the belt loop. The website mentions that you can cut the belt to length, but I wouldn't suggest this. There's also mention that if a comment is placed on the order, that they can be custom made but I didn't use this option so I cannot speak to it.\n\nThe belt does appear to be made out of good quality leather.

So many these days are so thin that every thing can be seen through them and also making things visible that shouldn't be, like a camel toe, this one will not leave you like this. The color is absolutely adorable! It's a very nice baby blue color but with a little more bright and pigment to it than actual baby blue, I guess is how to describe it. Then it's outlined in black which really compliments it and adds that sexy touch. The straps are good and thick and stay tied.\n\nMy only complaint with this LOUISE MAELYS Sexy Top Halter bikini is that it is tiny. The sizing is a little off. I would definately order a size up. I am normally a 10 or some articles of clothing a size 12 and I ordered the size large which the size chart says a large is a 12-14. This is too small. I would say the large is more like an 8-10 maybe.

I fell in love with the emerald green dress instantly.  I ordered it and waited.  Since I looked at the size chart I ordered a small. I am a petite woman and most dresses that I have to buy have to come from the juniors section at local stores.  I ordered this in November on cyber Monday and got it almost a week before Christmas. (Fair warning it ships from China. That is something not in the details.) I was so excited since the majority of the reviews say it fits exactly how it says it will so this should be the dress that fits me for once! Well the day came I came home from work and it was here.  I hurriedly tried it on to find it was about 5 inches too big around every part of my body. Instead of this fitting a small like I expected, it was actually a medium. Biggest dissapointment of my week. It was just a plain green cotten fabric too. It looked so different from the picture.  This was NOT the dress i fell in love with online.\nFortunately it fits my niece and she loves it so it won't go to waste and I don't have to mess with returning it to China. But I will NEVER  buy this again. I will NOT recommend this to someone else. Biggest waste of my emotions and time and money.\nBuy a size smaller if you can.

NOPE. This is great looking fashion jewelry. Clasp was really nice and works very well. It was fit perfectly for my husband's wrist too. This bracelet measure almost about 8\", it's made of a thick, wide leather that has what looks like a gold swivel strip braided into the center of the leather stretching out against the whole length of the leather bracelet. It has a unique clasp that is stainless steel that's easy to open and close, pretty easy to put on with one hand. The clasp opens and closes just by sliding it out from one of the sides. It has a magnet inside of it so once you close it, the magnets click together and have a pretty good connection so it's not falling off of you.\n\nNote: I received this product at a discount or free to allow me to test it, and the write a review based on the results of my test.

It would have been nice if the item came in a gift box or jewelry box as it is an accessory item. This kind of makes the product appear of lesser quality.\nThe bracelet that has silver stainless steel with black leather.  There is a strong smell to the bracelet so please be warned of that and is primarily due to the leather so if you don't like leather smell then this may not be suitable for you.\nThe bracelet fits a medium sized hand well. If you have thin wrists it may not fit you well unless you wear the bracelet higher. The bracelet appears to very sturdy and good quality and is not bulky with the right weight . There were no imperfections on the bracelet. Only time will tell if this is actually water resistant and good for everyday use. The buckle operates well and fits snugly due to the magnetic clasps. No matter how much force you shake your hand, the buckle will not separate. It is hard to get the buckle fastened but I think thats because I am not used to these types of clasps.\n\nOverall, a pretty decent bracelet for the price and would look great with casual looks.\n\nI received this item at a discount in exchange for my hones review and unbiased review for this item.

They are in China and suggested I give the shirt to someone else or donate it to charity. When I balked, they agreed to let me return it - but I would have to pay the postage!\nI suppose I will try to find a young boy who can wear this shirt. If I could give zero stars - I would.

I really like that, because it means that it'll be tight around my neck, not allowing the wind to get in, and covering my neck at the same time! I couldn't help trying it out, and went outside in 45 Fahrenheit (7.2 Celsius) weather, just for a walk around the block, and LOVED it! (I'll bet it'll be comfortable in even colder weather, though!) I also drive a bicycle, and REALLY want to try it on there, AND when going down a hill, (and around here, they get pretty steep!) [sounds great, huh?] In that instance, the extra warmth should be a welcome addition! I also wear ski goggles when it's really cold, (for which I've had people call me 'Darth Vader') because the wind will make your eyes water when it gets that cold! I will update this review when I get a chance to use this balaclava, as it's been warm here, lately! (In the middle of November?! C'mon!)\n\n(UPDATE 12-4-2015) I FINALLY got the chance that I have been long awaiting, and it was (sadly) bittersweet. I found that it IS quite wind-resistant, AND warm in cold temperatures, (it was 35 Fahrenheit, or 1.6 Celsius) however, for riding ANYTHING where you need peripheral (side) vision, it is completely lacking. Once you have the hood on, it will keep the wind or cold from bothering you, but when I go for a ride on my bicycle, I like to have the peripheral vision I told you about earlier, and anyone who rides a bicycle, motorcycle, snowmobile, ATV, etc. can understand what I mean here. That's why I can recommend this balaclava for people who walk to where they're going, (or as part of a health regimen) but if you use any kind of vehicle, 4 or 2 wheel, (or one with a track and skis) I must sadly ask you to search elsewhere, because this most likely won't help. I REALLY wanted to use this balaclava for cycling, too! I'm only removing one star though, since otherwise, it's a great balaclava!\n\n*This product was provided to me at a discount in exchange for a fair and unbiased review*", "summary": "A great balaclava and seems very warm, so far...

This seller was amazing in working with me around custom fitting this dress for my 12 year old daughter, who needed a dress for a formal event for a cheer competition's evening gala. We looked for months for a dress but all dresses we found were either too childish or too mature and not able to be altered to fit her. She is very small for her age (wears a girls size 8) and they custom made this dress to fit her very small measurements. They even ensured that the bust area was age appropriate. The only issue we have is that the crystals rub against her bare skin. This is probably isolated to our specific dress since they had to alter the bust area so it's missing the padding. Additionally, the dress is heavy so the plastic snaps used to keep the dress up are not very secure. We have a local seamstress helping us with making this more secure. Again, these may be isolated based on an adult dress being altered to fit a child. Otherwise, we are absolutely thrilled with the dress.

He loves to barbecue and I thought it would be a nice touch to encourage him to cook even more often (hes a great cook!).  He knew the apron was coming but did not see the sample or really know what to expect.  From the minute he opened the package he has been tickled pink about the apron being customized with his name! The apron is light denim washed blue in color.  It is a soft, light weight denim.\n\nHe is 6 tall and fairly large boned, broad shouldered, plus sized; so I was not sure if the apron would fit.  Happily the apron does fit (see attached image 1) although the ties are not very long (see attached image 5).  Personally, it seems to me like the ties could be quite a bit longer but at least they fit (image 5) and he is not complaining at all. He also made sure that I knew that the apron was very comfortable to wear and he felt like it fit him perfectly.\n\nAs you can see in the attached image 2, the apron has (2) generous pockets in the front, which my husband loves.  He barbecues a lot at night or after dark and he really likes having the pockets to carry his flashlights in.  The apron is also fairly long (images 1, 2 & 3), goes almost to his knees.  Since he is 6 foot tall, he and I both agree that the length is perfect on him!  The attached image 4 and 8 shows the beautiful customization of his name.  The customization, I noted while ordering, centers any writing you choose.\n\nImage 6 shows the inside of the top of the apron, with the company Port Authority on the label.  Image 7 shows the other tags inside of the apron 100% cotton.  Made in China. Machine wash cold.  Use mild detergent. Do not bleach.  Tumble dry low heat. Do not dry clean.  I admit that I have not washed the apron yet but when I do I will wash it on a delicate load and just hang it up to dry.  It shouldnt take the apron very long to dry.  I have not spoken to the seller, though, and I do not know if they use the same exact aprons for every order, or not.  This may or may not change.\n\nWhen you go to place the order, you are given many different options:\n\n1) Fonts:  Brush Script (the font I chose); Graffiti; Old English and College.\n\nHint:  If you type in the name you want in Embroidery Line 1 you can go back up on the page and change the fonts to see how each font will look on the apron.  A very nice little option!\n\n2) Font Colors:  The options offer (6) different colors (white, red, black, blue, green and yellow).\n\nHint:  If you have a name or statement entered in Embroidery Line 1, 2 or 3 in the sample image on the left will also show the font you picked in the color that you choose.\n\n3) Embroidery Lines:\n\nEmbroidery Line 1:  Allows 12 characters\nEmbroidery Line 2:  Allows 15 characters\nEmbroidery Line 3:  Allows 12 characters\n\nAs far as I could tell, it appears that all of the options are included in the price and there are no extra fees for picking any of the options.  I must admit that I was very surprised at how many options were given, including 3 lines of possibly embroidery!\n\nThank you for creating a beautiful customized apron at a very reasonable price, it made an amazing gift for my husband!  I would highly recommend this apron as a gift, especially with the holiday season coming up.\n\nAlso, thank you for taking the time to read my review, I hope we have answered any questions you may have had about this product!\n\nHave a blessed day!\n\nSincerely,\n\n(Mr. &) Mrs. Jr.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Swagge-Customizable-Embroidered-Full-Length-Apron-with-Pockets-OSFA-Washed-Denim/dp/B017HFV7QG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Swagge Customizable Embroidered Full Length Apron with Pockets - OSFA - Washed Denim</a>", "summary": "He loves to barbecue and I thought it would be a nice touch to encourage him to cook even more often ...", "unixReviewTime": 1473897600}

Package arrived today, and am very impressed. They snap into the frames perfectly. I bought the red lenses only to trick myself into thinking I bought brand new glasses overall. The light that comes through is very slightly brighter, but I actually prefer that because the original lenses were dark enough to get annoying in certain conditions. The package includes some cleaning solution, some care instructions, and an extra cleaning clothe to throw in the original bag.\n\nThese were not included with prime shipping, but the shipping was still free...I was given a delivery window from Aug. 26th to 31st, package was at my front door early the 25th (today).\n\nI'd highly recommend these as well as anything from the seller.

My dad said it feels like a good long lasting, quality shirt.\n\nThis was such a great gift; my dad was so surprised and pleased with it!\n\nI received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an unbiased and fair review.", "summary": "Fits my tall dad perfect!", "unixReviewTime": 1447804800}

Interior color-- I think this item would be much more successfull if they chose a more neutral interior to contrast with the dark brown leatherette exterior-- the russet-brown isn't a deal breaker, but it definitely looks specifically masculine than neutral...\n2. more of a gripe than a 'con' per'se... Depending upon where you buy this there may be some inconsistencies in\nquality of workmanship-- so don't buy this on Ebay or other auction sites--you won't get a necessarily new one, or possibly\nyou'll get a 'defective' item..--\n\nPros\n1. It looks even better in person than in photos. The clear top is sleek and elegant and the simple design looks\n elegant without being overdone and it still looks nice displayed with other case/pieces.. I left the protective film on the glass to prevent scratches.\n2. The interior storage is amazing! The key-lock hidden/stacked storage design drawer inside is safer and a better design\n than the cases where only part of the case locks and the rest is unlocked or open-- so you will feel more secure knowing that everything you put in this case will be securely 'locked' -- Especially if you have holiday or cocktail events and nosy visitors decide to give themselves\nan unauthorized tour of off-limit spaces...\n3. Easy to store. The design makes it easy to stack and store as needed. the simple design will blend\nwell with more vintage pieces in the same dark brown family--\n4. The price- Comparing prices will definitely ensure a great deal-- i think at the time Amazon had this item on-sale for the lowest price (and they still might be lowest, currently ) and with a gift-coupon and free shipping it was even cheaper!\n\nOverall this is a keeper and great piece to add to any jewelry keepsake collection!\nOur grade: Solid B; or 4Stars!", "summary": "I {{Like}} The Ikee Design Wooden/Leatherette Locking  Watch Case -- Grade: Solid B or 4 Stars!!", "unixReviewTime": 1496188800}

I thought it might fit since I don't have a very long torso but it's just not made properly. I'm 5'1 107 lbs. The length for a small is supposed to be 75cm/29.5in but instead they measure 65cm/25.5in, those missing 4 inches are definitely the cause of this very uncomfortable wedgie. Extra fabric bunches up right above the super wedgie since it's wider up top and so short in length. I really wanted it to fit like the blue one I seen in another review with 5 stars but it's obviously a completely different one since mine has plastic buttons instead of the metal ones she has on hers.

Because I haven't worn it long enough & I obviously haven't washed it yet either. I actually really like this product. The package arrived wayyy before the delivery date I was given ( by like a month) & the package arrived undamaged. The shirt itself was soft to touch & very soft on my skin. It fit literally exactly as shown. I have the thick thighs & big butt. & I'm petite. I orderd a large & it fit perfectly. As it being to tight around the thighs for some women.. I think this particular shirt is made for the right size thighs. So if yours are bigger then average, then it might be uncomfortable for you. & if your super skinny & not as curvy, the shirt won't fit exactly how you want it to. As for the buttons, many reviews said they popped off & ripped instantly... Mine did not. The shirt isn't thick material. So when your snapping of the buttons, don't literally rip them off. I also read that a bracelet was supposed to be included as well. I did not receive one. Overall I'm happy with this purchase.  Just an fyi:if your taller then 5 ft I would try a size bigger might fit better. But I honestly think this shirt was made for little people (like me ) & I love it.", "summary": "Good shirt.

The leather does stretch, so after a week or so, I no longer had a problem getting them on, but someone with large/wide hands might have trouble.

I do not know if it is because it is China made (yes, it is -- you will see if you purchase it; the packaging shows it). And I have bought a China made belt about 2 years ago and that fit perfectly.

I ordered extras, in different colors for this reason and also for extra outer lenses as they do get scratched up over time.  I give it 5 stars anyway, simply because years ago Bolles' or Oakleys cost  a fortune if you needed prescription lenses.  I couldn't afford the $450 Oakley set so I settled for the $300 Bolles'... The Oakley lenses were specially made with the prescription lenses permanently set into the outer lens, while the Bolles' came with an insert.  This product is quite similar to the Bolles' I purchased years ago when I was a bicycle courier in Washington D.C.

Secondly, I had not noticed this before, but there are NO pockets on or in this bag. I had a couple of organizers that I haven't used in years, because all my other bags have a lot of pockets in them; I pulled them out to fix the problem. Then, I really had to fix the opening problem cause if I didn't the opening would drive me nuts and I would end up getting rid of it. So, I found one of my scarves that have the same colors on it and threaded them through. I took the plastic, rope/cord and tassels off and used the scarf. Not only did this fix the problem, but it made it look REALLY cute!

The snaps on the one I got were not pressed on very well and 2 of them came loose the 1st day my son wore this.  I think I just got a one...\n\nOverall I really like this romper, I will be fixing the snaps with my snap press and keeping it.

As a Grandma, I think it's a very nice onesie that has just the right amount of stretch to it. The snaps work well, and appear to stay snapped even when you pull on them (this is important to me because when onesies first came out, the snaps were notorious for not staying snapped). The only down side to this outfit is that it does have kind of a chemical smell to it, so I advise washing it, first, before you use it with baby, just to get the softness into the material and the smell out. Other than that, it's a cute outfit that is not gender-specific, meaning it would be great for a girl or a boy.

There is nothing about what the materials are or care procedures like you see on allot of clothing tags. The material is nice it doesn't feel cheap and the graphic is printed on the cloth so it doesn't feel rough or anything either. The stitching is also well done with there being no fly-a-ways or tears in the fabric. When I pulled on the romper non of the stitching popped or stretched which I always take as a good sign. The legs are closed with snaps and they lay flat and are smooth so they won't irritate at all. The material around the sleeves, neck and ankles is stretchy.\n\nWhen Alexander was crawling around and playing in it he seemed to be able to move easily as usual except for when he tried to clap his hands or wave them then the sleeves would cover his hands. It is supposed to be for 18-24 months is what a size 90 equals out to right now my son wears 18month shirts but this was quite big on him but he has plenty of time to grow into it. He did end up getting a little to warm in it so we had to take it off but that just means it will be great for when the fall and the coming winter roll back around. The gray color is a little light so I think I would have liked it better if the cloth was a dark gray but that is a personal preference.

I got the gold tone sunglasses.  They come in a very nice semi hard black glasses case.  Within the case is on cleaning cloth and one fabric glasses carrier.  The case itself is very nice and has one side the can clip onto your purse or pants or any bag.  The only issue I had with the case is that the strap broke off so I couldn't use the strap.  The glasses themselves are nice and big, the lenses shade out a lot of the sun.  Though the ends of the glasses, the part that goes back by the ear, was a little sharp and tended to dig in.  I am sure you can just sand it a little or maybe it was just my pair that had that issue but it's something that I wanted to mention anyway.\nI received this item at a discount or free for my honest and unbiased review.

Boy was I wrong. Not only do these look great, I bought the silver with the black lenses, and now I want the gunmetal with the black lenses.\n\nThe company who sells these, Dollger, is really helpful. They include a car that tells you how to care for these sunglasses, a soft case for them, and a more rigid case. These sunglasses look great. They're very light weight but they don't feel like cheap plastic like so many sunglasses do. I've already got compliments about these sunglasses!\n\nI would definitely recommend these to anyone who wants a stylish pear of quality sunglasses! I have a thinner face, so some sunglasses seem too big on me, but not these! I was happy to find that out. This is a really stand up company with great support, which you don't find often when buying from a store with products at this price point.\n\nI was lucky enough to be able to purchase this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

Fits absolutely perfect now. Color and appearance exactly as expected.  I was very happy with this shirt.

If you're wondering what size, definitely go up one maybe two sizes. They do seem well lined though, so maybe the thick socks won't be a problem.
