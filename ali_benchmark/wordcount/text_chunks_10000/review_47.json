I would continue to buy this bag over and over as long as the quality does not go down any lower than it has.  My bags take a lot wear day to day so I have to wonder about those who say it fell apart quickly how the bag was being treated from the start.  If it were checked luggage for 50+ flights I would agree it would not last as long but also consider the price.  This is an $80 bag that will do you just fine as a carry on bag and last for years.

Waited about one and a half weeks, shipped from China to Southern California.\n\nMeasurements. It says \"one size fits all\". Here are the actual detailed measurements (everything was measured flat):\nLength (from shoulder to hem): 25 inches\nArmpit-to-armpit width: 28 inches\nArm sleeve hem-to-arm sleeve hem (with the cardigan laid flat like a \"T\") was about 46\" in width.\n\nMy measurements are: I'm 5' 2\" with a 40\" bust, 34-35\" waist, 17\" shoulder width, 11.5\" bicep circumference.\n\nMy review: It smells mildly plasticky. Nothing what a light wash and Febreeze couldn't fix. The upper arm sleeves are rather tight and very fitted. NOT baggy or long sleeved at all. Like all the other reviews for it, it really is a 3/4 sleeve. If your bicep circumference is over 11\"+, don't get it cause it will either be too tight or won't fit. The cardigan is not as over sized or baggy like how it looks in the stock photos. It's also thinner too (more like a light weight sweater or cardigan) not thick or bulky. It really does run small though. Mildly itchy too (in case you have sensitive skin).\n\nAccording to the label sewn in, it says \"acuriru 100%\" in Japanese which translates to \"acrylic 100%.\" It's technically made out of synthetic fibers (which may explain its weird chemical/plastic smell and semi-itchiness).  Care instructions are (also translated in Japanese): Machine wash at normal setting in water temperature at 40 degrees celsius or less. Do NOT use chlorine bleach on this garment, Cool iron at 80-120 degrees celsius with a cloth placed between an iron and garment, this garment can be dry cleaned w/o restrictions, hang dry in the shade (I guess that means you shouldn't put in the dryer or it might shrink).\n\nOverall, its a cute cardigan, still wearable (hoping the sleeves will stretch a bit), fairly fast shipping, and the pricing is very cheap!", "summary": "It's okay, runs very small though.", "unixReviewTime": 1418169600}

Also, they didn't press it and the lining and outer layer ar puffed out from each other and not hanging flat. So...first I have to carefully iron every inch of this (very low heat, I would imagine. Looks as though it would melt on a higher heat). Possibly that will help it to hang better. I have a feeling I will end up having to rip some seams and insert interfacing into the neckline. Hmmm.

In fact, I feel that this watch can probably endure a fair bit of rough treatment without any issues (though I would have to suggest avoiding throwing it around a room just for kicks :P). It feels nice in your hand to hold, and it's not too big or small. It's very easy to use as well, even if you've never used a pocket watch like this before. Operation is pretty simple - press the \"button\" on the top to open the front, press it down farther to open the back, turn the notched head on the button to wind the watch, pull it up and turn it to set the time (pressing it back down when done). When winding the watch, I originally thought I wasn't going to be sure when it was fully wound, but it's quite obvious, and as long as you're not horribly sleep deprived or angry while winding the watch, I find it highly unlikely that you'll overwind it. With its mechanical simplicity, you might think that it must only have that, but no - it's also quite nice looking! The internal mechanics look beautiful, the casing looks nice and the engraving/detailing looks to be pretty well done. And on top of all of these other things, I've found that this pocket watch keeps time quite well - 5 days straight and it's still accurate to the second. :)\n\nThis watch isn't perfect, to be sure, but any \"flaws\" I have found aren't really a big deal, and their importance will vary person to person, but here's a few small issues to note: The face of the watch can be a little difficult to read depending on your eyes. My own eyes have a little bit of an issue with smaller details depending on lighting, and the hour hand can be a little difficult to see against the mechanics just behind it. The button for opening the watch can take a little getting used to, as well - the front and back both open with the same button, but the front will open before the back does. It takes a bit of training to learn the proper amount of pressure to apply to open the front and not the back. In the mean time, though, you can always hold the back with your hand while you open the front to avoid also opening the back.\n\nLike I said - there aren't really much in terms of cons or negatives to the watch. :)\n\nSo you might be wondering: why would you want to spend 4 times as much on a pocket watch if this one is so good? While I do admit that this is a fantastic watch in general, and not just for the price, you DO see a few benefits from buying a more expensive watch. For example, if you wanted a specific material, such as silver, this obviously doesn't offer you that. More expensive watches will also have certain other features, like a photo insert, or a stand on the back. Other than physical feature differences, while this watch is nice, there are definitely nicer watches out there. This thing looks and feels great, but there's just something nice about that pristine, perfectly clean appearance of a more \"jewelry\" oriented watch. Bright, clear, shining metal looks nice to me, but obviously that may not be the important thing for everyone. Also, I've noticed that having a nice watch with glowing hands for lower light is quite nice, as the glowing helps a lot for the aforementioned low light, but the added thickness of the hands makes it much easier to see even in full light (for people with eyes like mine, anyway xD).\n\nIn the end, you have one question to ask yourself: do you want a pocket watch with solid construction, a nice look to it, accurate time-keeping, and is easy to use all without breaking the bank? If so, this is definitely a good choice. It won't offer the best in pocket watches, but it definitely makes for a good gift or a good pocket watch for those who aren't sure if they really want one.", "summary": "A Great Pocket Watch In General, Not Just For The Price", "unixReviewTime": 1413504000}

I am thrilled with it and will be purchasing several. I suggest if you want it but are afraid of the other reviews of being to short if your not willing to put alittle effort into stretching it  as I did I suggest don't buy, but if your thinking putting effort in would make it worth it then GO for it !!! (just make sure you have something not to heavy not to light) I could live in this sweater it's eye catching and you would be surprised how many compliments people will give over it.

I took it off after about 30 seconds (maybe a minute tops), and the elastic on one edge was loose, leaving the edge of the elastic part of the belt looking rippled/puckered. It's still usable, as the puckering doesn't show when it's all stretched out, but I don't expect it to last long. I may have just gotten a defective one where the elastic wasn't fully sewn in to the belt, so if you buy it, I hope you have better luck than me.

Those are not very comfortable and are kinda long on my short torso and flips up in the lower back area.annoying!  So, anyway I had a few concerns and requirements for this purchase because of the price and if I planned to wear it during workouts and (almost) 24 hours a day!!  It had to be comfortable and it had to be short enough to be able to sit all day.  You think you want a long cincher to cover everything until you get one and then you hate it.  I wear this one right under my bra-line and it ends right below my belly-button.  I have a little pouch that is under it but I hope to see that disappear soon with diet and exercise.\n\nSo, it is Thursday and Ive had this cincher for about 4 days now.\n\nThe first time I put it on.it was hard to put on and super tight.  I slept in it that night and it was very uncomfortable.\n\nThe following morning I wore it to the gym.  After the first few workouts, which were enhanced by the added ab supportthe cincher started to loosen up a bit.  I can tell that I was more annoyed with it than anything.  It was stretching from the heat I guess.\n\nI wear it to work all day and it helps my back pain.  By Wednesday I was on the second row of hooks.  Surprising, right?  I don't think I lost that much in a matter of days but some loss is possible because of my daily enema routine (dont judge me..lol) and diet changes (no processed carbs).  I, personally, think it just stretched out with the heat.  Now that I am on the second row of hooks it feels secure and tight.  My waist looks and feels snatched and I truly enjoy wearing it.\n\nThere are no sharp bends in the bones of the cincher, they are very flexible.  It buckles a little at the top and bottom because of my upper back fat and the curve of my lower back but it doesnt hurt and I feel very sexy when I wear this.  Ohh just wanted to ad that when you workout in it there is not much restriction in movement if you wear it in the right spot.\n\nOh and measure your waist right below your ribcage not the lower waist we measure for weightloss and at the doctor.  That may be what I did wrong and why I am on the 2nd row of hooks already.\n\nHope this review helps..", "summary": "XXXL 42 Size 16/18", "unixReviewTime": 1398902400}

If you have any belly at all, it will look like your pregnant if you pull it down ! Mine almost pulled down to my lower thighs! The sleeves were just the right length, though. And the material is medium thickness and absolutely soft! The inside of hood is like a short furry stuff, but only in the hood. Inside the body of this, it's a soft, brushed white material! It also comes to sit lower in the front than on the model, and I'm rather big busted. I still love it, and it's so comfy! I have washed mine already, in warm water and a hot dryer, and it did not shrink. Came out as soft as new! I like how the hoodie  drapes, just like on the model.

It was so comfortable. I put it on, and the double sipper thing was a bit surprising. There is a zipper inside that you don't see in the pictures that you have to zip first, it's shorter in length, and I think it's just there because of the cut of the jacket, it helps it lay right, not a biggie, just a surprise. And if you want to wear it unzipped, you can't cause of the double zipper.\n\nBefore ordering I read a lot of reviews and everyone says it runs small, which makes since, since the designer is in Asia-someplace. But when I ordered mine it did state the size correlations; S = US Size 2, M  = US Size 4, L = 6-8, XL = 10, 2XL = 12, 3XL = 14, 4XL = 16, 5XL = 18.\nI am normally a US size 12 in tops, so I ordered the correlating size 2XL, oh my gosh was it huge! Not just big, maybe I can pull it off big, but huge I look like I look pregnant. Even when I pulled the band down around my thighs, as the model wears it, there was so much extra material that it bunched in the middle and made me look pregnant. When I tried it on for my husband, that is the first thing he said too \"you look pregnant\". After having three kids I want my sweatshirt to hide my tummy, not make me look bigger.\n\nI love this sweatshirt/hoodie, but I had to return it, luckily I did order it through Prime.

Well it fits fine however this tankini does not have any elastic under your breasts so I'm thinking when it gets wet, it will loosen up there and let your breasts float out.  So I called SWIMSUITSFORALL to find out if a size 16 was available, so I could return the 18.  I would keep the 18 until I try the 16.  If the 16 never became available I would have had my sister alter the 18.  I felt it fit ok with the straps cinched up all the way, but the other problem remained.  The first time I had no luck, then the second call I found the 16 by asking for the item number.  It turns out you can order this tankini without bottoms ( like I did) or with a couple different types of bottoms-boy shorts.  I got the top by itself because I ordered a swim skirt and swim shorts to go with it.  The reason I tried the 18 was the cup size. A statement that 16 was for C/D and 18 was for D-DD & up.  My back is narrow and bust large, so you'll have to decide what you like.  I haven't rec'd the 16 yet but I think it will fit best.

Even cosplayers sometimes use chest binders. This was a cheap alternative while I saved up to afford another binder from the official underworks website, but alas, this isn't very good. The main problems I'm encountering would be:\n-It's not the right kind of material. Binders need to be able to stretch a bit, so the person wearing it can breathe, so they don't hurt their ribs, and so they don't do any damage whatsoever to their lungs/bodies. This item isn't going to allow this, and is probably going to put the person wearing it at risk. You're only supposed to wear a binder for about eight hours anyway, but honestly, you probably shouldn't even wear this one for three hours. I've been wearing it for maybe thirty minutes, and I've noticed that I can't even take a deep breath.\n-It's not very good at binding. In fact, I'm wearing it and my breasts are still popping out. It fits great, but it seems to act more like a tube top, to be honest. And tube tops aren't chest binders. It's tight, but it's not BINDING.

The material is better than I honestly expected for the price, and is nicely lined - fitted but not cliingy. My only regret is listening to the sizing reviews in the instructions. I'm a 34C and ordered my usual medium, fearing it would be a little tight (didn't size up bc the large wouldn't have arrived in time). I definitely could have gone down a size and still been very comfortable (and probably felt more secure up top).

I'm 5'9, 115/120lbs, 34C, and I usually wear size 2/4 or small. This dress was a perfect fit. I ordered the black in size small. I've attached photos of how the dress lays. It comes to just above my knee, and after sitting, bending over, and moving around in general, this dress will not ride up! It's a fitted, ruched dress that accentuates curves and hides imperfections. Even with the built-in padding in the bust, I opted to wear a bra for the extra lift. As other reviewers have stated, the sleeves are attached to the bodice under the bust, not above, but this was not an issue for me. The sleeves stayed up with no problem. You could always add double-side tape or sew a few stitches to the top part of the bodice. Panty lines do not show (yes!), nor does that weird bulge most of us get when wearing pantyhose (you could always do thigh highs, though!). Looks great with heels, and is perfect for date night or cocktail-attire events. I will definitely be buying another in a different color.

I have quite wide frame glasses(5.5\") and these fit over them with room to spare.  I've not worn them a lot yet, but so far so good, like others i've worn. Quite dark, which is fine with me. BUT, until i got them i didn't realize the side lens are clear, (untinted), which i have yet to see on any other glasses of this type, so i was not expecting this. If you look at the pictures again with that in mind, you will see what i didn't when i bought these. The problem for me is these side lens let too much light in, especially at certain angles to the sun, and i get light reflecting off the inside of the dark lenses, dramatically reducing my vision at those times (i notice the same effect with most clip-ons). So much so, that currently i have covered these lenses over with black tape, and intend to refit them with some cutout lenses from some old sunglasses, because having them blacked out reduces my peripheral vision. Odd design IMHO. And monkeying around i didn't expect to have to do. They should at least indicate this in the description.", "summary": "Clear side lenses!?", "unixReviewTime": 1423872000}

I ordered these to go under a particular dress, but I was thrown off by the color in the photo. They look more blue-tinted than green in the photo to me, but in person they're much more green-tinted. They look closer to mint in person than in the photo, which will be good for you if you actually want mint tights rather than what they appear as in the photo (at least on my monitor). I'm 5'2\" and 117 pounds and they fit well. They haven't sagged at the waist like my other leggings and they don't squish my fat and give me muffin top or anything; they are high-waisted, so that might be why. There is a typical seam down the insides of the legs, which looks fine, but there is a slighter seam going down the outsides of the legs, which I think looks weird. I actually thought it was a really long run when I opened the package, but then I realized it goes all the way up and down on each side, so therefore it's meant to be like that. The worst thing about these leggings is that they're see-through; they're not solid. I can see my tan skin through them just like if I was wearing pantyhose or thin tights. Because they're so thin, they're not forgiving to any bumps or bulges you might have around your knees; I feel like my knees look bumpy compared to how my other leggings make them look.

I will definitely be ordering in other colors.", "summary": "Awesome Dress!", "unixReviewTime": 1384300800}

The price was great..I think I paid a little under seven dollars plus shipping costs. I received the glasses  in 2 or 3 days after ordering. Really fast which was nice because I was excited to see them in person. So when I opened the box they came in a very nice sturdy case....which seemed worth the price I paid already.!!!  The glasses were gorgeous. They looked like I  was wearing true , expensive designer sunglasses..When I put them on I felt like a movie star !!!!!They are so chic looking...I got a complement 5 minutes after I put them on!!!!!!!!!!

I'm tall (5'11\" - ordered a large), so I really appreciate the long sleeves and torso of the jacket, the hood is actually big enough to cover your head comfortably.  It isn't really heavy, but I have a lightweight vest that looks good under it for those colder days -- the arms are tight, so I don't think I could comfortably wear a bulky long-sleeve under it.  My workplace is cold, so I usually wear my jacket all day, and since the material is mostly cotton it doesn't restrict movement.  The only thing I don't like is the left-hand zipper is small, but the pocket is large, so it is difficult to get my phone in and out of that pocket.  You definitely  can't use it for a hand warmer!

I wanted a well designed gym bag. I was tired with struggling with the zipper on my cheap bag. I really liked most of the designs I saw made by this company, but there were no reviews for any of their bags, this review is the first. So I was taking a chance.  Evidentially I bought the last one Amazon offered through Prime, I didn't have to pay for shipping and I had the \"free returns\" option, so the risk was minimal.\n\nI opened the box expecting to be a little disappointed - but was I surprised! This bag is perfect. Perfect design, materials, stitching, lining - everything! And there were a few nice surprises. I thought there was a possibility that, from the pictures showing a side zippered panel, that there might be a shoe compartment, and I was right. There are three inside pockets, two open with leather piping on the top for cell phone and easy access, and a nice zippered pocket with a very high quality leather front. All of the stitching on this bag, both inside and out is perfect.\n\nThe side panel, shown in the photographs with a sort of sideways \"S\" shape is one large pocket, deeper on one end and shallower on the other. There is a nice contrasting brown canvas panel that mirrors the exterior under the pocket - an unnecessary detail that reflects the quality of the bag. The leather strip that holds the two handles together snaps together easily and has a nice feel to the grip. The high quality zippers are a little stiff, but I expect they will loosen up with use.\n\nI searched through this bag to see if there is one negative thing I can say about it, but I can't find anything wrong with it.\n\nThe bag is extremely handsome and well made.

Its not as perfect as what i saw in the picture. The top part is see thru so i have to wear something underneath,& i didn't realize how short it was. Im gonna wear white shorts underneath but they stick out like a sore thumb to where i look like a \"special\" angel. So im incorporating a skirt with it too. Trying to make it as modest yet cute as possible takes alot of work. I wanted a tutu type angel costume & wear it to my church's trunk or treat event on halloween & this was the only one i could find,i should have bought a typical angel costume instead. Its still a great costume,maybe for thinner girls & can work with it. But its cheaply made for something thats 39 bucks cuz if ur not careful it can rip when putting it on, i took it out of its bag and there were stray strings hanging & coming off. Disappointed but i can work with it. Id recommend it for those looking to where it once for halloween or just the dress for sexy time with a significant other cuz of it being see thru & short. Im giving 3 stars due to its faults.", "summary": "Wasn't what i expected", "unixReviewTime": 1444262400}

The cameo itself is dainty, yet incredibly detailed. The simple open-back setting is the perfect complement; understated and sophisticated. The sterling silver chain accompanying the pendant is fine, but surprisingly strong - completing the entire beautiful picture.\n\nThe cameo and chain are presented in a lovely box, complete with ribbon and bow. They were placed in separate tiny plastic bags, which protected each of them and prevented the chain from becoming tangled.\n\nSabrina Silver were outstanding to deal with. I initially ordered this necklace, and then cancelled it a couple of hours later. This was mainly due to the fact that I am a terrible procrastinator and over-thinker. The fact that there were no buyer reviews, was a big factor in my decision-making. I live in Australia, and the subsequent distance/time/cost factor if I wasn't happy with my purchase, came into play also. Sabrina Silver were gracious enough to cancel my order without question. Obviously, I changed my mind a few days later. I couldn't get this beautiful angel out of my head! I had looked at many others in all sorts of settings and finishes, but this is the one that stayed with me. I re-ordered her, and felt a little (read: a lot!) uncomfortable doing so. I kept waiting for a \"Are you really sure this time, Skye?\" email - but of course it never came. Instead, I received notification that she had been put in the post and was on her way. My beautiful necklace arrived today - a week later - and I am thrilled. My original hesitation was unfounded.\n\nI hope that this review may serve as a note of confidence for anyone who has wanted to purchase the pendant, but hesitated due to the lack of feedback. You will not regret your choice. She is my every day and forever necklace. She is so very special.

I went ahead and ordered a size 7 which fit great. After wearing I noticed they stretch out a lot. However, be aware that although the listing (for me) said *free returns*, the company will NOT honor that. I went back and forth with them and they gave me some BS answer about why they wouldnt even though my size and color did say free returns.

This Lolita Blouse was exactly what I needed. Seller was very courteous and gracious and offered to custom-make my order. I gave them my measurements: chest, waist, hip, etc. and they did the rest. The item fits PERFECTLY and I'm not exaggerating. I have a very disproportionate body. Large chest, very short torso, and waist and hips are almost the same measurement. There is always gaping in the chest or it is too tight in some areas. One feature that I love about the blouse is the lace up detail in the back. It can be tightened or loosened for a fitted look. There is a lot of pin-tucking that gives you the hour glass shape while hiding any problem areas. I have a broad shoulder that tends to be wider but this fit perfectly like a dream. Sleeves were the exact length as well. The only con if a con at all is that the lace is a slightly different color than the white cotton that is used for the blouse. It's very subtle and likely not detected or commented by others but nonetheless it remains the facts. I'd say it's an off-white or eggshell color.

I may try removing the tiny buttons on the collar to see if it helps. Maybe a smaller size, for a more fitted look would have been better for me. I regret not asking if the returns were free--I'm guessing I've waited too long.\n\nThe item looks like the photo and the fabric is thin but not transparent.

They have batwing arms if you look at the photo,so you will definitely have room\nto move.

I didn't want to swim in this,\nAnd I didn't want to use this as one of those snuggie-things , I wanted to wear this out, and look good wearing it !.\n\nPLEASE, if you have measurements similar to mine, don't be afraid to buy the small. I got the color AND THE FIT, and so can you(if the color is)\nstill AVAILABLE. so don't fear or hesitate, this isn't so much a cardigan, it's 78% polyester however it's good for early fall. it's in the 70's here in Ohio\nat this time and sunny, so I could wear this today with a short sleeve blouse if I wanted. Don't expect sweater like material THIS is not THAT.\nthis is good for work(offices) or a nice cover up over a top for dinner out.

It was pretty obvious I was ordering a dress from China, and almost everyone is aware that the sizes are smaller.  They shouldn't just change the sizes without advertizing that.  I would not have ordered it if I had known that.\n\nSo I ended up with a dress that was too big (like 3 inches too big in the waist).  They offered me an $11 credit, not really super thrilled.  What I really want is my size small that I ordered. Anyway, I re-sewed the waist so it's smaller, and I wear it with a 2 inch off-white leather belt, so the top is a little more blouson-like.

When I first put it on it was clear that it's not exactly made from high quality, but that is to be expected considering the price. I bought it for a specific \"dressy\" occasion and was hoping I might be able to make it work with a nicer blazer thrown over it, but in the end it just wasn't a good enough material. In saying this, however, it is something I would have worn out with my friends to get dinner/drinks, or a night out with my boyfriend. The only issue is that it was too big for me all around. I am 5'5 about 130 lbs, generally in good shape and slightly bigger on top than bottom, and it was somewhat baggy on me. I tried other belts that I already own with this dress (cause the one it comes with is literally just a piece of rope-like material), and it still didn't fit me as I would have liked. Another thing to keep in mind is that the back part of the top half is see-through. And actually, the front sequence part is not made of a very thick material either, so in the sun it is sort of see through as well. Once again, this would be fine for a night out with friends if you put a cute crop top or bralette underneath, but not necessarily appropriate for work or a nice function. All in all, if I would have ordered a smaller size, I would have kept the dress for the price alone. If you are similar in size as me, I would definitely go with a small.", "summary": "but in the end it just wasn't a good enough material", "unixReviewTime": 1441670400}

I spent months researching various wallets for my needs (yes, I know it was a little OCD) but the thing is that I couldn't find a wallet that was a good fit for me.\nThings that I look for in a wallet:\n1.) needs to carry a lot of cards,\n2.) needs to be secure,\n3.) needs to be relatively slim,\n4.) prefer that it's not made of metal or hard material\n5.) prefer that it's light\n6.) prefer smaller form factor\n\nEnter the Bellroy Very Small wallet: It's about the height and width of a credit card but I can put 12 cards in it and it's still only slightly more than half an inch thick. The half zipper means that my cards are secure but when it's time to pull one out that I have space to flip through them without having to take them all out. Plus it's at a good price. But it's not all function, the leather makes it look classic while the Owl gives it a unique detail (I really like that), and on the blue version the contrast of the interior leather color looks pretty nice as well. The zipper slides smoothly and the construction feels sturdy.\nOne little negative thing I have to mention though: the color of the fabric lining is not the same as in the pictures. I originally ordered the black one because I really liked that detail with the light blue stitching and the matching color in the pattern of the fabric lining, but when I got the wallet the interior was different shades of brown. When I emailed them to ask if it was a fluke, they told me that ALL the wallets in the \"very small\" line now have the same brown color lining because they discovered that the blue coloring ran and stained the contents of the wallets. I wound up returning it and getting the blue one instead because even though it has the same brown fabric lining, the leather portion of the lining is this nice parchment color- makes for a nice contrast. Anyway, so just be mindful that when you order this wallet the interior color will not look like the pics they have here or on their actual website. Normally I would have removed a star for this- but their customer service responded to my emails super quickly, their emails were personal (not scripted), and they were very proactive about offering me alternatives and solutions- so in this case the great customer service made up for the minor issue and they definitely earned that extra star.", "summary": "Form factor comparison and a little note at the end...", "unixReviewTime": 1441324800}

Unzipping the wallet around adults made me feel like a child in professional environments, I also ended up stuffing my cards and money into my pocket as I didn't have time to zip and unzip the wallet after making a purchase.\n\nThe leather wore in extremely fast, and also made me wonder about how the cards are held inside, as there is a very defined inch line at the bottom of the wallet where nothing goes, maybe it's for change? Also the metal emblem is VERY out of place, and catches on things. There is a leather slit on the inside that may be for a key, but mine wasn't opened beyond the leather being cut, so if something was to go in there it couldn't.\n\nAfter having 2 Bellroy wallets, I will no longer be buying anything from this company.", "summary": "Good for a couple cards ONLY.", "unixReviewTime": 1453766400}

I can pull long sleeves over them or pull the gloves up over the sleeves if I choose to.  I receive compliments on them every time I wear them.  I have driven with them on, and they keep my hands warm, but still let me grip the wheel.  I love the camel color...I also got the red ones...I'm thinking I may order some more colors.....I haven't washed them yet.", "summary": "I like fingerless gloves at times", "unixReviewTime": 1417478400}

The kind lady at my local store said the quality was that of \"Claire's\" (cheap) and put a better quality clasp on it for free. So I have it for myself right now and spent 30 dollars on a similar hematite pendant with jeweler details for my friend.\nEven more surprizing is that KONOV has yet to respond to my concerns, and this lady fixed the necklace for me as best she could for free when she didn't sell it to me.\nAmazon's customer service people were very helpful but say I won't get a refund from the seller since it was repaired. Guess I'll wait and see but it's been a week and a half.\nThank you for nothing KONOV, you guys are a joke.", "summary": "hate to be the bad guy...", "unixReviewTime": 1363132800}

The best part is that the sleeves are 3/4 sleeves and have a button on the bicep area if you want to fold it up and secure it. I have slender arms so that might not work with those fabulous women that lift weights...just a heads up. I soooo love this.

I ordered the sand color and in the picture it doesn't show gold thread and small gold sequins. I think it makes the poncho more elegant. Looks great with leggings(no personal body parts show) and dark jeans. I tried it with light washed jeans and it didn't really pop. The important thing to know is you have to be careful with it because it snags easily. I put mine on with no rings or bracelets. I then put the rings and bracelet on after putting on poncho.  I hand washed this poncho and hung to dry and it kept it's shape and didn't snag in the process. Even though you have to be a little more careful. Fit is very casual. Fit is very flattering and lays well on body. But with the sequins I can see wearing black leggings and some gold gladiators and you would look like a million bucks!!

My watch was shipped from China in a rather flat, KS branded cardboard box that was badly dented in transit.  Inside the box the watch was nicely packed, and included tags, warranty, instructions, etc.\n\nThe KS-095 has a more elegant design than similar Chinese multi-function watches.  The main hands and lower dial (24 hour), are set by the crown.  The day and date dials are set with the recessed pushers on either side of the crown.  The instructions specify the main watch hands be set to 5:30 before using the pushers to not damage the movement.  The case is a reasonable 40mm in diameter, but at 15mm thick, feels a bit clunky. The face looks a bit plastic on very close inspection.  All six hands are inset with a poor quality lume that fades in minutes.  There is no lume other than the hands. The writing and logo on the dial are very sharp, but some of the gold hour indices are slightly skewed off-angle.\n\nThe band is made of stiff leather, that is sized for Asian wrists.  I have smaller wrists, but I still need to use the third hole from the end.  It is rather thick, but seems to be conforming and getting more comfortable with age. The band seems sturdy, but only time will tell.  The buckle is low grade (stainless?) steel, and does not match the case's gold finish.  It also must have a low chrome content, and seems to tarnish. The exhibition back reveals a nice looking \"turned\" Kronen & Shne branded counter weight sticker, giving the appearance of an engraved part.  The rest of the KM0206 movement has rather crudely finished metal parts.\n\nMy initial complaint was that the movement sometimes stopped while being worn, and had a poor power reserve.  This watch often stopped running when placed on the night stand while I was sleeping.  The reserve seemed to run 6-12 hours.  I have discovered that while the KM0206 movement is non-hacking, it does allow hand-winding.  Since fully hand-winding the watch, it seems to be working fine (maximum 30hr reserve). Unlike previous automatics I've owned, the self-winding doesn't seem sufficient to keep this model working.\n\nOverall, this is a nice looking watch from a foot away.  It doesn't really look or feel cheap, but its \"automatic\" movement reflects the price paid.\n\nUpdate:  The gold plated finish is wearing off in places after less than 1 year of use,  The crown's finish went first, and now the lower case finish is wearing away/tarnishing.  I have managed to clean up both with a Q-tip and some Bar Keeper's Friend cleaner, but the etched KS logo on the crown is now gone and the case is a bit rough where it lost plating.  This is ultimately a disposable watch, and is priced accordingly.  I would suggest choosing the stainless steel option for a longer lasting finish.  I just really liked the look of the watch in gold.", "summary": "Cheap Inside, Where It Counts - Requires Hand-Winding", "unixReviewTime": 1414886400}

There is a window on the back where you can see the ticking wheel and gizmos. Hard to believe you can get an automatic self winding watch for this cheap. Slide rule is cool. This watch does in fact tell time. Good for a first automatic watch.\n\nThe instant you feel this watch you can tell it is cheap and fragile. I was afraid I would break it because the scratch-protection plastic was very difficult to remove and the wristband feels flimsy. The date and day setting buttons don't work, but setting the time works. The second hand keeps ticking even while setting the time, so it can't be synchronized down to the second. The slide rule is slightly inaccurate (e.g. it said 2.00 * 2.00 = 3.90).\n\nObviously you get what you pay for. The telling time part of this watch works, it looks cool, and it is good value. The complications do not work.\n\nUpdate: The complications do work. I think it only doesn't work between 9pm-3am, perhaps because the date mechanism is in action during that time window.", "summary": "It Works!", "unixReviewTime": 1475625600}

I recently bought this, as well as two other ties, to try to I prove my daily rotation. At first, I was impressed by the PenSee tie. I like the gold (some gold bow ties look too glossy and are better suited for tuxedos rather than more casual wear). The fabric felt nice and the tie tied very easily (some ties are too stiff and more difficult to manage).\n\nThree weeks in, wearing this tie about twice per week, it has begun to fray around the edges. At first I thought it was just my tie breaking in a bit. But it is getting worse. Soon, the tie will be completely unwearable.\n\nYeah, it's a bargain tie. But so were the other two I bought (and every other tie in my collection). I've never paid more than $15 for a bow tie and most of mine cost under $10. I've worn a handful of them regularly for years without a sign of wear. For this one to fall apart after a few weeks is ridiculous.\n\nIf you're looking for a novelty that you're only going to use once or twice, this tie will do fine.

I found this dress on Amazon and decided to order it for them. I wasn't sure how the fit would be, because it seems like a lot of the clothing items we order, end up coming from China and are extremely small compared to US sizes. This dress was perfect! It was the exact size we needed. I thought it was very well made and my daughters said the material was really comfy. There also is a stretchy element to the dress, so it hugs to the skin and stretches. It is not low cut, and fits very well. I do highly reccomend this dress for anyone looking for semi-formal attire. I do think the pictures don't do it justice and it looks great on! The rhinestones on the belt area are a great accent and really sets off the shimmery material on the dress.

Plus, it has an actual locket so I'm going to get a small picture for it. The only criticisms I have are that the clasp that hooks is a weaker metal, and I can already see it pulling open which will break it. I think I have a pair of pliers around here some where and I'm going to squeeze that ring/circle closed so it's not pulling open. The other thing is that the necklace is a MESS to deal with--I almost think it should have been designed so all the necklaces hook off of one main chain, rather than having a bunch of necklaces lumped together to clasp. Trying to organize and unravel this to put it on takes time, all the chains get tangled and folded over each other and it's a huge mess.  If you have the patience to work it out and organize it so you can put it on--the necklace itself is stunning. Each charm is beautiful and well made. It's a nice thick metal and most of the chain is thick and durable--only the ones that attach to the clasp are questionable as I mentioned earlier.\nThis is a gorgeous necklace. Keep it hung up so it stays untangled and you will have a beautiful necklace that will get tons of compliments.

They were shipped in a timely fashion, however, upon examination of the package content, I found that the package was torn, the glasses were packed inside the vinyl pouch without instructions nor the described cleaning cloth. There was no way to ascertain whether the glasses were truly 7 x 25 because there were no markings or anything inside the package or tag attached that showed the lens strength. I assumed, because of everything I have described, that maybe the item had been previously sold and returned.  Initially, I contacted the seller directly  hoping to speak to someone about resolution, hoping I could get an exchange.  I chatted with someone that gave me a telephone number and an e-mail address.  No one answered the phone when I called.  I then sought resolution by contacting the seller through Amazon.  After sending pictures of the glasses, contents and the box, I WAS FNALLY TOLD ; \" We are sorry for the inconvenience caused, but we sell only new items and we believe the package was damaged during transportation. Anyway we can confirm that you received binocular exactly as ordered and advertised.\"  I assume I am suppose to accept that statement at face value. THEY NEVER PRESENTED THE EVIDENCE.

I did a lot of looking for cash system wallets, and there are some great ones, I just wanted to be able to remove my envelopes.

They have others that do empty out, where I keep frequent shopper cards, and other non important things.  Another great feature it has is \"safekeeper\" which is some kind of lining that prevents thieves from using scanners and getting your credit card numbers.
