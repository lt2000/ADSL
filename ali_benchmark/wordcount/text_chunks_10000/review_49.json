The gem was tilted a bit not perfectly straight for those with ocd I took off a star because it had that small defect many cant notice but I do . It is costume type jewelry I don't expect many uses out of this but it would definitely last at least three wears. Mine came packaged fine with no damage except the red gem tilted.

While I don't see any \"educational\" value...the ring is, however, very well made & sturdy. The stones are set securely....(the blue setting is gorgeous in person!).... and the alloy that the ring is made of is polished to a high shine so that it looks like silver. My daughter has had the ring/bracelet set for about a month now and there hasn't yet been any sign of wear to the ring band, no chipping or fading..however, I wouldn't recommend wearing the ring everyday solely because of the material it's made of or signs of wear will begin to show quickly.  Any jewelry that is \"coated\" will begin to fade around the band if worn everyday, so to make the \"coated silver finish\" of this ring last longer my daughter wears it only 2-3 times a week. Seller also shipped the item the same day it was ordered and it arrived about 2 1/2 weeks after the order was placed. This seller also included a very lovely box that the ring arrived in and can be stored or gifted in and the box was well wrapped in bubble wrap to protect it during transit. All in all.....very pleased with both the purchase & the seller and would recommend this item to anyone that is interested (or has a child interested) in Black Butler Anime.", "summary": "Very Nice Ring", "unixReviewTime": 1398988800}

Hell, Maybe even all of them . I'm here to honestly tell you how your experience will be with this cincher.\n\n**Please remember cinchers are different than corsets. Corsets are made for more serious waist training.\n\nPosture: I have been using this product for about a week and a half and with it on notice a change in my posture. Mostly because with it on it is uncomfortable to really slouch. Uncomfortable, not unbearable. You most likely sit straighter because the bones in it are plastic and you might break them doing some dramatic moves. I've noticed I walk taller and sit straighter with it on.\n\nSizing: Based on other reviews I'm sure you notice there is a lot of issues when it comes to choosing the correct size due to the inconsistency. I'm going to try my best to make this as simple as possible. I am a 36C/D bra size. When wearing women's T-shirts I am a Medium (Men's Small) and in dresses I am most comfortable in an 8. The reviews told me to order 2 sizes up so I did, buying  an extra-large (XL).\n\nHow it Fit: The first time I ever used the cincher I was able to put it on the tightest setting (second row). Ideally you want to first be able to put it on the loosest setting (1st row) then graduate to the second you know it's working and that your waist may be getting smaller. I may have been better off getting a large. I have ordered another cincher and this time a Large. As far as the initial size I bought (XL) it's not too tight even on the second setting . When I say not too tight, I mean that I can breathe in it . I do feel compression and it does flatten me out but I'd rather have a large just for my preference so keep that in mind. I will say that the XL for me starting off on the second setting was probably a good starting point seeing as though I never typically wear cinchers or corsets.\n\nGym Use: So far I have used this cincher in the gym. It was not uncomfortable even when sitting down and doing floor exercises. It does give compression allowing for proper use and that little extra something to work your abs . In comparison to a typical exercise bandits does not collect a lot of sweat so it's not extra gross when taking it off after a workout.\n\nBody Shaping: Okay, I'm sure this is where many of you jumped down to. Trust me, this was all I was searching for in reviews. So this cincher actually does give the appearance of a flatter tummy and smaller waist under my clothes, but it is NOT a dramatic difference. I bought this to introduce my tummy and waist to the idea of waist training ( if these are your intentions, this product is a good place to start) HOWEVER, if you are seeking a product to begin serious waist training, it is best to begin with a steel boned corset. This cincher easily takes away 1-2 inches of your waist. May be another inch or two more but I would need a smaller size to be sure. Does give a more flattering appearance under your clothes and active wear at the gym ,\n\nBody Results: Like I have stated previously, I have only had the product after a week in a half. So far, I have seen a slight difference. I'm not sure if it's just when I take it off because everything still seems to be sitting in the right place. But I do feel like I'm pinching less when touching poking and my sides. The current results make me optimistic about future results so I will keep using\n\nFlaws: I can see the cincher hooks through my clothes. I would not recommend wearing with skin tight apparel. If you bend the bones they will snap. Since I have a relatively short torso this cincher meets my bra sometimes pushing in my underwire which is sometimes uncomfortable.\n\nWelp, that's pretty much all I have. If you have any additional comments or questions feel free to contact me at genee143@comcast.net .  I am not paid or anything I just know how hard it is to find honest thorough reviews. I am not sure if amazon has a messaging center but if they do you can message me there as well. Happy Cinching!", "summary": "The HONEST Review Your Looking For", "unixReviewTime": 1405468800}

The color was different then pictured (it was a pale yellow and they pictured a bright yellow) but I actually liked it better so when it came time to order my younger daughter's prom dress I had no qualms about ordering from Gorgeous Bridal again. I think my mistake was in not communicating as effectively. With my oldest daughter I was very nervous about it and asked a ton of questions and made it very clear what I wanted. I remember telling them that my daughter hated wearing heels and I wanted it to come to the top of her shoes instead of all the way to the floor.. I didn't do that this time so when the dress came it was way too big! It came with a hoop skirt. With the hoop skirt and the highest heels my daughter owns it dragged on the floor. The problem was that my daughter didn't want to wear the hoop skirt or very high heels and she didn't want it to drag on the floor at all so it was about 8-10 inches too long.. It was also too loose on the back. Gorgeous Bridal was willing to alter it and pay for shipping but with the time constraint and the initial cost of shipping it back to China ($65)  I was worried that it wouldn't get back in time. They did a partial refund so that I could get it altered.\n\nTo be clear. The dress is absolutely gorgeous. The material is a really good quality and the workmanship is superb. It comes with a tulle slip already sewn in so it pouffs out quite a bit without having to add a hoop skirt. My mistake was in not communicating enough. I sent in my daughter's measurement but I didn't specify how I wanted it to fit. The customer service is really good and they are quick to get back with you, but there is a bit of a language barrier so it's better to spell out exactly how you want it rather then to simply assume they know what you want. I'll definitely go back to them. I did try getting a dress from another company and I wasn't happy with the results at all!", "summary": "Make you sure you let them know EXACTLY what you want.", "unixReviewTime": 1488844800}

It is a snake chain with a lobster clasp, an extender, and a heart charm. The connectors at each end of the snake chain unscrew to allow the Pandora style charms to slip on. At the end of the extender there is a heart charm which, though small, could be engraved with an initial.\n\nThere are all kinds of Pandora style charms sold online, in craft stores, jewelry, and discount stores. This bracelet is lightweight but sturdy and well constructed. I would not hesitate to put more expensive charms on it and know they would be secure. Who knows?

It is not too heavy on the wrist and does not weigh me down at all.  It is a thin delicate elegant piece of jewelry.  It has a claw swivel clasp which is very easy to open and close.  There is a 1 1/2 inch extender that the claw clasp hooks onto that is great for adjustability.  This is great for women teens or children to use.  The bracelet can be worn anywhere whether is is a fancy or casual outing.  It can even be used daily because of its design it is very versatile.

At first I was nervous getting white tungsten because I was worried it would be a cheaper metal. Although I did some research and found out that tungsten is right below a diamond as far as hardness goes, so it'll never lose it's polish. The one draw back I found is that harder metals like this one tend to be more brittle, so it'll break easier. Although Thorsten has such a great warranty that I figure they're pretty confident it'll never break. One other helpful fact that you might want to be aware of is that you can't resize tungsten (because it's so dang hard) so they need to send you a brand new ring when you send it in to get resized. The warranty should cover this, but if you're sentimental then that's a big deal. For me, if it breaks or gets resized I'm just going to have a priest bless the new one. I bought my fiancee a white gold ring and it's already losing it's color. My brother in law has a platinum band and the edges have slowly become rounded. White tungsten looks the same as white gold (as long as it's *white* tungsten) and is a heck of a lot cheaper, and meanwhile will maintain it's color, shape and luster for a lifetime. As long as you get a good warranty (not because you'll use it but because it shows that the manufacturer has confidence in their product) then I say go for tungsten!", "summary": "Awesome ring!", "unixReviewTime": 1345507200}

Love the pockets and buttons.  Simple sophisticated design is who I am.  The zipper came down a couple of times when I would sit down, but added a belt and it fixed the problem. Please continue to make more of these types of skirts in 20 PLUS.  Thank you!", "summary": "I finally found what I've been looking for", "unixReviewTime": 1486944000}

They look simply fantastic and the pu-leather feels grand! They are sturdy and well made, and are spot on for cosplay! I know that taking the measurements seems a but tricky but here is what I did:\n\nFirst, take all your measurements accurately and write them down. I used a measuring rope for this.\n\nNext, I would reduce the calf measurement by one centimeter. I did this and the boots zipped up snuggly and I don't have the huge gap in the back that everyone talks about. And, don't worry, there is still plenty of space to stuff pants into it.\n\nAfter that, determine whether you want a tight fit around your foot or a looser one. I increased my foot measurements by one centimeter each so that my foot has plenty of room to move around.\n\nAnd, finally, for the boot height, it includes the top flap, so you definitely want to increase that. I increased mine by about three centimeters and it just comes over my knee l, so if you want it to go completely over it, I would suggest adding on at least another four centimeters, for a total of at least seven centimeters.\n\nAlso, you may want to buy some insoles for cushioning, if you want.\n\nEven though you gotta play with the measurements, it is totally worth it. These boots are amazing, and do not smell nearly as bad as what I expected them to, they just smell like new shoes.\n\nSo, if you are looking for cosplay boots, look no further, these are the shiz!", "summary": "Beyond Amazing!", "unixReviewTime": 1442793600}

Weilert", "reviewText": "When I bought this watch, I was in need of a self-winding skeleton-style watch to replace a different one that had broken after many years of use. From the images, this watch looked like a good fit for my style. Once I got it, though (many weeks later, by the way . . . no Prime shippingwhich itself was an indication of troubles to come), there were a few things that didn't seem right. First, Im not sure what the numbering on the outside of the bevel is supposed to represent, but these numbers don't add any functionality to the watch. Furthermore, the small circle on the left side of the face of the watch is just that: a small circle. Theres no secondary second hand there, and its pretty much meaningless.\n\nAs for the functionality of the watch, there have been many questions about if the band can be adjusted. The truth is, it can be adjusted, but youll have to take it to a jeweler to do so. There are no adjustment tools included with this watch for you to be able to adjust the band yourself. Unfortunately, this wasn't even the most significant flaw: the watch didn't keep time at all. Usually, Ive had to purposely move my wrist for the first few days of wearing a self-winding watch, but after a few days, itll accumulate enough charge that it will keep time even if Im not wearing it. After a week, this watch wouldnt keep accurate time overnight, even when I wore it to bed. It would also run out of charge mid-way through my day, which shouldnt happen given the activity that I do that normally keeps this type of watch wound up.\n\nAs I was searching for replacement watches, the price of this piece allured me, but after my ordeal in trying to return it, the lower price wasn't worth it. A reliable self-winding watch has historically cost me anywhere from $100 to $150, and for a good reason. Aside from the flaws I mentioned above, I was trying to not buy from a brand that seemed to be obviously Chinese. I figured Carrie Hughes sounded like an American brand, but boy was I wrong. When I got the watch (again, after about two weeks of waiting), it came in a package covered in Chinese characters and containing a card typed up entirely in German that I think was asking me to give them a 5-star review. Once I realized this watch didn't work, I went through the painful process of returning it. This process was constantly hindered by what appeared to be a fundamental lack of understanding of the English language. I had to continually be hounding the seller to provide me with the option to return the item (since it wasn't eligible through Amazons normal process), and then had to follow up with them once the USPS tracking number had shown the package had reached them (of which I had to pay for shipping). They never told me that they had received my return until I asked about it two weeks later, at which point I finally was able to get my refund.\n\nIn short, if you want something that kind of looks nice, but doesnt function, this watch is for you. Otherwise, stay away!", "summary": "Buyer Beware!", "unixReviewTime": 1531526400}

I thought I would give these a try. And here you have \"my learnings\".

Maybe it was my fault for not reading some of the reviews, which now, I realize have commented on this issue. The pulls do not work with regular men socks because they are too small; I attempted to use it with 4 different pairs. In addition, most men socks are mid to upper calves and the pulls are still too short to reach that from the right below the knee part. I think these will be great if you are wearing ladies below knee stockings or something that thin (I am sure there is a proper name for them, I just do not know. The are made of stocking material, but they are socks right below the knee.)\nNumber two, the buckles that close the part that goes around you leg are made of metal. They are super sleek looking; but if you have hairy legs your hairs will be pulled.\nI do have to say, the product seems of very good quality, and it is very nice looking; just did not work for me; with my socks, and my hairy legs.

It was just not flattering on me, and the boob part was just constantly coming off. I'm not sure if it's just because of how it's cut and that it would act like this on everyone or if it's just because I have no boobs, I'm inclined to think it might act like this on everyone to some extent but if you have more substance in the cleavage department that it might help a little (either way it's nothing some tape shouldn't be able to fix). I'm 5'8, 140lbs, 36b, and usually a medium in tops and a large in leggings (smaller ones are just too short). 5 or 6 in pants, and I think a 29 although I haven't had anything sized that way in years. I bought a large in this and it was the proper size for me, a bit of camel toe effect but minimal and it could be solved with the strategic use of a pantyliner (personally one of my favorite fashion tricks).\n\nUnfortunately I don't have much of anything in the hip department either, maybe if I had either hips or boobs, at least one of the two, this might've looked pretty good, but I don't so it just looked silly. It did improve when I stuck a cute long sleeved hooded crop top on top of it, so there is always that option if you end up getting this and it doesn't flatter you either, and you can also put shorts on top of it along with the crop top to further cover up any unsightly bulges while still having an interesting vaguely out-of-the-box type look if shipping costs make returning it nonsensical.\n\nI gave it four stars because while it didn't look good on me, it DID look like it did in the picture, I just don't have the right body for it, and the fabric feels really nice and silky and has a good amount of stretch to it, and the legs were actually long enough for me which is not the case a lot of the time (also the butt part did look really good, but it just wasn't enough to salvage this for me).\n\nIf you have proportions similar to the woman in the picture (or if you at least have nice hips) then get this, along with some fashion tape and pantyliners :) if you don't you might end up disliking this but it can be repurposed to serve as something interesting to wear underneath a different outfit to switch things up.\n\nGood luck :)\n\nUPDATE: Added a couple pictures for reference, I wore a bra under it and then covered that with my hand/phone for modesty purposes but it should give at least a general idea of what it looks like", "summary": "This can be very unflattering but on the right body it could look great", "unixReviewTime": 1436140800}

Some stocks, business, house, cars, feed the homeless???  Nope how about some sunglasses.  Let me tell you for 8 million dollar sunglasses these do not dissapoint...sure you could buy the $20 sunglasses that are polarized and block out 100% of the suns rays...but who wants that? You can just buy yourself new eyeballs no need to have sunglasses do that.  Its the comfort and style ur paying the extra $8,264,682.64 and boy is it worth every penny, after receiving these I opened up the box put them onand its as if the lgith from the great fireball in the sky only hurt my eyes alittle instead of alot....I sure am 1 happy camper.  I recommend everyone buy themselves a few pair, 1 for weekdays and 1 for when ur out about town.\nUPDATE MARCH 19, 2013...So I was going to buy my 2nd pair of 8 million dollar sunglasses when I came back to this page and saw it went up to 18 million...still a bargain if you ask me. As much as the 8 million dollar impressed Im sure the 18 million dollar pair would be just as awesome of blocking the suns deadly rays from my eyeballs...I might just sell this at a large discount. So for you folks reading my review, instead of purchasing the 18 million dollar pair of sunglasses I will let you buy mine for the low low price of $17,999,999.99 Ill even include free shipping.  Just leave me a not and let me know your interested in my friends and family discount.

I ordered a size 4 and it fits perfectly on my body except the length. The length was too long. First I adjusted the straps (top) by hands to shortened it by 1inch shorter so that the cup of the dress is on my chest. Then I had to cut the dress length shorter because it was too long. I hand sewed the dress length by hand after cutting off the length by about 3 to almost 4inches off the dress bottom (can't remember exact inches but was a good width of fabric and this is an estimate since I threw my discard fabric away and can't measure them anymore).\nAfter stitching by hand my dress to fit on me perfectly with my 2.5inch heels for my cousin's wedding. I had a lot of complements about my dress, hair and makeup and my family asked where I bought my dress because they said it is beautiful and perfect for the wedding in a humid tropical climate near the beachfront. They were surprised to know that it was from amazon and was pretty,beautiful and well made like it came from a department or a bouquet store. The dress was not heavy on me and looked amazing. I will be ordering  other dress from this site in my future for sure when another occasion comes up.  My pictures are from the day I got the dress without any adjustment to fit on me. I even took a photo of it after hanging my dress on plastic hanger without alteration, then I hung my dress on top of my bedroom door to try and show how long it was.\nI like to give it 4.5 stars but can't so I gave this dress a rating of 4stars because it was really long for my height even with 2.5 inches heels without alteration on the day I got my dress from the mail.", "summary": "Beautiful, exact sized as it stated and is long in length.", "unixReviewTime": 1505260800}

Every week or so the belt would simply slip out because the teeth inside the buckle wasn't really getting in there, but it did leave gouge marks in the leather each time it came out so I would have to snip. It got to the point where I bought a mitered scissor (for $15) just so I could be certain I was making good square cuts in the leather. Eventually I had to replace the strap (of course) and still I have these problems. Now today, less than a year after purchase, the belt buckle just decided to fall apart into pieces. The pins that held all the moving parts together just fell out and the thing just crumbled like a cracker.\n\nThe idea is good but the execution of the Eazybelt leaves a lot to be desired.

My head is a little small at 20.5\", however I am able to comfortably wear an average wig. The average wig is designed to fit a 22\" head and be able to be pulled in by 1/2-1\". This headband is designed to fit a 22\"-23\" head before it's stretched slightly on your head. If you fasten it any less than 22\", the rough part of the Velcro is not secure and can and did grab onto my long wig causing the hair to get caught in the Velcro. In addition to poor design, the material is flimsy and after two uses, it's falling apart. The stitching on the rough side of the Velcro has already begun to come undone,  as has the edge with the serger finish. Between both uses, I haven't even worn it for more than 4 or 5 hours nor have I washed it!  So since I know my way around a sewing machine and need to fix this one and cut to down to fit, I'm using it as a pattern. I purchased material with a similar nap at my local craft store on clearance for $6/ yard and industrial Velcro on sale at $8 a yard. My half a yard of fabric will easily make 8 of these.

The outfits are cute and fit the look we were going for, but they are a bit small. I hope they dtill fit by the end if the summer. The boys are slim, but the waist size (even with the elastic) seemed to be a bit tight. The shirts are cheaply made; they're very scratchy material and the button holes started fraying the first time we tried them on. Definitely need a white undershirt underneath!  Although I bought the tan color outfits at the same time, the ties were very different colors. One was more light brown and one was more greenish. On top of that, one of the ties broke imediately. Luckily we had different ties planned. The hats and the shorts themselves are cute and nice. The shorts were a bit see through - careful with colorful underwear or diapers. I didn't notice until it was too late. I'll have to take off and move the buttons on the suspenders since there is no way to adjust them.  One of the boy's suspenders were too short, and the other's were too long. Overall, we were very satisfied with the look of the outfits for the price, but you know, you get what you pay for.

And I truly don't mind having to fold my paper cash. I am only using this wallet in my cross body bag and we don't get the Harley out but maybe 2-3 times a week, so I only put as much cash as we'll need to eat lunch or dinner.\n\nThis wallet is really a nice wallet.

This is on a 4 inch wallet.\n\nI LOVE that it has so many slot for Credit or business cards. I have 16 cards all together, and some are doubled up - and they fit without any problems at all. No bulging of the zipper and the entire wallet looks great....not over stuffed. It's real leather so I know it will last a long time, provided it's taken good care of!\n\nBuxton makes good products, their quality is exceptional.

This was perfect for my son who is very thin.  The only issue was that the jacket button was not sewn on very well and fell off almost immediately.

For reference, I wear a size Small HJC CL-17, size Medium Shoei RF-1200, and a size Medium Bell Bullitt TT.\n\nStyle:\nI love this helmet because of its retro look. The interior lining is soft and extremely comfortable. There are nice details like the leather visor pull, the shield pod that secures the visor, the chrome trim, and the round red graphic. I also think the cream color give it a classic look. If you search online, there is a video of how this helmet came to be. In a nutshell, a college student created this helmet design as his thesis project and Bell contacted him about producing it.\n\nOn the motorcycle:\nThe helmet provides great air flow. It does not have a chin curtain, so it gets loud on longer, greater speed trips. I use this helmet primarily for commuting, but even then, I wear ear plugs. The helmet provides a wide view range, which I like.\n\nI purchased this helmet from Edwards Motorsports & RV through Amazon.

Only drawback is I'm not sure how long the zipper is gonna last, as it doesn't seem very durable. But overall, I am pleased and a great price.\nETA: I liked these so much I got them in White, but they were out of mediums so I had to get the large. While the large is still wearable, they don't enhance my lower body like the mediums do. They are somewhat baggy around my hips, butt, the top of my legs and knees.

The cut/ style of scrub top is closer to NORMAL sized clothing, unlike most other scrub brands. Those who are small understand the struggle. If you typically wear any layer besides a bra (i.e. a camisole or undershirt) beneath your scrubs, you may want to consider sizing up. With that being said, this top washes well, dries quickly, & doesn't require ironing. (winner!)  The print is super fun and the length of this top is just perfect for a smaller frame. Pair with whatever brand of pants fit you best; I promise the fabric won't look weird.\nFor a size reference, I usually purchase an XS in the mock wrap style top from Grey's Anatomy. Unfortunately with that style, I find that there isn't enough \"boob\" room for my taste, but it fits well otherwise. I am happy to say I haven't faced that problem with this top.

I had a scheduled C-section for my second child so I bought a second gown (Ella) for my 4-day stay at the hospital. First off, the snaps in the back and front are the best features of this hospital gown. I was able to walk around the maternity floor without feeling that \"draft\" or fearing that my butt is hanging out. I also didn't need that extra gown to wear around my back to cover up. The front snaps were great for skin-to-skin and nursing as well. The \"nursing gown\" they gave me at the hospital had open slots in the front so it felt like my boobs were going to pop out at any time unless I was wearing a nursing bra underneath. The snaps on this gown was super convenient for nursing and pumping. This was also very easy to get in and out of whenever I showered or if I had to go to the bathroom. I don't have to look for the laces to tie these around or loosen them if I have to nurse my baby.\n\nI also received compliments from our nurses and even they said \"why can't they make hospital gowns with snaps in the back?\" ...at least for the maternity floor. Yes...why not? The material was pretty stiff when it arrived so I remedied that by washing these in warm water and put a dash of fabric softener and it was good to go! It had that \"worn\" feeling to it.  My only \"regret\" is that I wished I had known about these when I had my first baby.

I recommend washing the shirt immediately after you get it (I usually do this with all my clothes, not just this shirt in particular)\n\nUPDATE: it has been quite a while from when I purchased this shirt to now when I'm writing this review. As expected after wearing this shirt a lot,m and the constant washing the logo has faded a little, and surprisingly the color has also faded quite a bit, but overall I am very happy with my purchase.

I've also bought 2 for my Dad.  The material is extremely well made, durable and comfortable.  It's not cheaply woven, and I've never had a seam come loose.  The sizes fit exactly as I'd expect them to.  It takes about 2 years of continuous wearing (2+ times a week est) and washing before you notice any fading.  If you wear it less, the colors last much longer obviously. The colors are amazing; all very rich and well dyed.  The pattern has always been 100% centered.  The best thing about this shirt, for me, is the people I meet when I wear it.  People come up to me and say, \"I love my pit bull too!\" and I end up making new friends.  I also find the price very reasonable, especially for such a well made product.  I would recommend CafePress shirts.", "summary": "durable and comfortable.

They fit great before i dried them and now they are too short.  Keep in mind I dried them with the rest of my laundry on low heat.  I would buy again but maybe buy a size up so after they shrink they will still fit.", "summary": "Shrunk in the wash!", "unixReviewTime": 1512518400}

Period. I've looked around a LOT for a BIG airy hat with good sun protection - found it.\nExcellent firmness to the wide brim with cloth underside to shade the face and neck. Same cloth on the top (for the slightly balding). Very light, and because it's actually slightly too large (on my big head, 61cm+, 24\"+, which is wonderful, allowing it to breathe) I made a few adjustments.\nRemoved the sweatband (just WAY too hot), added chin straps (shoelace stitched on the inside, see photo), and a loop for clipping to belt buckle, and then decided to ADD the sweatband again (turned out to be a bit too loose without it), but this time also stitched the upper part of it inside the hat, so it doesn't actually touch the head/forehead very much (not like the original \"sock around your head\" feel).\nOn a windy day you really want that chin strap (or sweatband if that's for you) since this hat wants to FLY. And on a rainy day you better keep this thing safe somewhere.\nThe brim can be reshaped (metal wire on the inside) to a style you like. The flat top is something you get used to (would have preferred a slightly more angled shape to it but heck, it works). It's the perfect summer hat for people with big heads (61cm+, 24\"+), it breathes, is cheap, and with a few minor adjustment - the best hat I've ever bought.

You know how special occasions can be - for the perfect item your budget has a little give - so I'm not rating it based on the price.

Why even call it faux fur when it's like a soft carpet? I also don't like the cheap ribbon in the center. Why pay for a gorgeous dress and accessories and then have a cheap ribbon front and center in your outfit?\n\nI ended up trying boleros, shrugs, capelets, wraps, and jackets for the snowy wedding. My favorite was a convincing faux fur stole that added to the beauty of the outfit instead of just looking like a utilitarian or costume piece slapped on top.\n\nWatch out for tops that detract from the outfit and shift focus to the shoulders when you're trying to show the girl. I remember in modeling class, we were taught that you make some clothes look better but some make you look better, so go for the latter.

The print is very slimming because the designs are vertically oriented, which helps fool the eye and distract from the mid-section. I'm 5 feet 5 inches, and the length is great on me (a little over an inch below the knee ). The shoulders fit perfectly and the V-neck is great if you use a shoulder-strap purse...no neck stretching.\n\nOne thing I like about this dress is that I can use it for vacations in Hawaii, but I will also feel comfortable wearing it here at home. This dress is very versatile. It just \"works\" for so many purposes. The sleeves, neckline, and knit material of this dress also give a little protection from a chill if there is air-conditioning in the store or restaurant.\n\nWashed it on gentle cycle, cold, with woolite dark, and damp-dried on lowest heat for less than five minutes. It did great. It's completely wrinkle-free. I'm air-drying it the rest of the way on one of those thick foam bendable hangers that don't leave any creases. Does not seem to have shrunk at all.

I'll be honest that I was worried with a larger order of so many small items that the seller might forget one or two items when shipping, but they were all there when I got the parcel. Some of them do need a smidge of DIY TLC. Have some superglue ready in case of pieces falling off (trust me, pieces will never fall off again). Really, though, even with a little assembly needed for SOME of Yazilind's products (only 3 out of the 10-15 I ordered even needed any altering), you're getting some very nice jewelry for the price! I get compliments on my bracelets, necklaces, and wrist cuffs all the time! It's my little secret that they were less than $5 each! The only part of the pieces I received I didn't like was that the bracelets are lobster clamps - so hard to get on by yourself! I feel like pull ties would be much more manageable, and probably look better, too. I will probably find some threads for them and replace the metal chains on the bracelets with pulls instead when I get the chance. Other than those few small complaints, all the items I received from Yazilind were as pictured, comfortable, and very charming.

My feet are 8.7\" (22cm) long from big toe to heel, and the widest part of my feet measures 3.5\" (9cm). My ankle is 8 3/4\" (22.2cm) around.\n\nIf your foot measurements are close to mine, or just a tiny bit bigger, then the 6.5~7 size should fit you very well. If your ankle is any bigger around then you might have some trouble fastening the clasps. Mine are snug around the ankles but comfortable. The tabi don't slide around on my feet and they are easy to walk in. They feel even better in a pair of sandals.\n\nThese tabi are the real deal, non-stretch, and as far as I can tell from the packaging, legitimately made in Japan (not 100% sure though -- almost certainly imported from Japan at least). The packaging says they are 35% cotton, 65% polyester. I bought these to wear with waraji sandals (Bleach costume, you guessed it) for an upcoming convention. I'm sure I will be able to walk around comfortably for several days in them. I will update this review once I've had a chance to wear them for a while.\n\nMy only disclaimers: Before you take them out of the bag, hold the soles up to your feet to see if they match. The seller's note says they are non returnable if they are worn. Also, if you are looking for form-fitting tabi, you will almost definitely not want to get these, as they do not have elastic.\n\nOverall, these fit very well, and I really enjoy them. The quality is good too. They look like they will hold up to some wear and tear. Not bad for my first pair of tabi!", "summary": "I love them.

For the price of 5 bucks, I definitely was expecting a transparent string wearable only by microscope. But this blew all my expectations out of the water.\n\nThis is a belt that is true to size, true to picture, all down to the tiniest rhinestone. I ordered the white belt and it arrived quickly from NY in secure packaging. There were no defects (usually with anything involving rhinestones I basically assume a few would have fallen out, but not this!), and the loops aligned with the belt notches and holes. The size was quite hefty  medium-to-large thickness, making this a beautiful statement belt to cinch a tunic or dress. Length was good too, even though I ordered a S/M, this could easily adjust from small to large sizes especially as these work best around the waistline versus hips. I am less sure if this belt with its width would be able to go through pant loops, but for my intents and purposes it really jazzed up my plain dresses.\n\nThe customer service was attentive as well, with a cute thank you note in the packaging and contact information at my disposal. The design was impeccable and pretty intricate for the price. It really looks much more expensive than it was, and I have bought my share of designer belts that looked like they should have been sold at this belts price! Even though I got this at a minor discount, I would not hesitate to buy one at retail price. In fact, I think I may be buying their other colors and designs so I can have a spectrum of accessories to match my outfits. Keep a watchful eye for this brand, because if the other designs are as cute as the one I got, this brand has got some potential.\n\nDisclosure: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. Particularly, I'm known for either rave reviews, or brutal reviews because I don't lose any incentive to do so - what I say reflects how I actually feel about a product, and honesty comes first. Speaking of honesty, when it comes to reviews, I honestly don't think mine are the very best that no one ever was. I consider my hobby accomplished if my opinions are sorta heard and of course, I am happy if they end up helping any prospective buyers. If not, Ill be fine after crying myself to sleep for a few nights. Its cool.", "summary": "This brand is so hot right now.", "unixReviewTime": 1461110400}

For what I paid I was expecting something so-so nice, but I was actually very pleasantly surprised by the quality. The suit looks nice and the lining and construction on the interior was especially nice and it has a number of pockets on the inside. The cuffs have 4 decorative buttons.\n\nBe aware that as it is shiny and the picture likely being taken in bright light, it is actually a little darker than it appears in the picture. The pants are not hemmed, so they will have to be hemmed but that means you can then choose with or without cuffs. If you can sew it is no big deal, or a tailor should be able to do it pretty cheaply, but I would expect this with an off the rack suit to be honest.\n\nFor the price it was at and the unexpected nice quality I have to give it 5 stars.

Mine did not bleed after washing it once, but my son fell asleep in it and when he woke up his face and mouth were covered in black fuzzies, some of which were very clumpy and large! I had to fish black fuzzies out of his mouth. I threw this onesie out because I was freaked out that he has swallowed some of them.\n\nThe red/white onesie also did not bleed in the wash, and it looks just like the onesie that the baby wears in the movie Labyrinth, so I planned on putting my son in it for Christmas photos. After several washes, I am constantly finding large clumps and balls of red fuzz all over the place - in his crib, pack n play, changing table, inside his diaper! This did not wind up all over his mouth like the black onesie, but I will not use this for daily wear anymore.\n\nSo in short, if you have a big wide baby and want a cute striped onesie without an applique on it for a photo op, these are fine.

But problem solved! By putting a tube or bandeau top underneath it, I was able to successfully prevent unwanted exposure, and it actually looked like part of the suit! I had to do a tremendous amount of searching through Amazon just to find the right bikini top to wear underneath it (can't have straps, can't be tie in the back, not too much coverage around the chest, etc.) and I found 2 that I really liked and go well with the suit: The Sheridyn Swim and the BC Bandeau tube top.  I especially like the Sheridyn Swim b/c it has a clasp in the back and the bandeau is just a tube you slip on and off. But it was fun b/c I got the bikini tops in a bright and fun color to wear underneath this black suit to give it a little pop of color.\n\nThe suit itself isn't really of great material, it's thin and kinda flimsy, but it's not terrible, and it's very inexpensive, so you can't expect too much from it. It's very comfy and you can adjust the straps that tie around your neck like a halter to either have the V Neck drop down and be loose or tighten the straps to make the V Neck flush against your skin. The smaller set of ties go around the front of the suit around the waist to create a tie or bow (that took me a while to figure out). But I like how the suit is breezy and feels like you're not wearing much, especially on top and even with the bandeau or tube top. It's stylish and sexy and daring. The only drawback, is that in the back, where the briefs come up, the banding is slightly tight (especially for a large) so it create a slight bulge, but not bad. For reference, I'm 5'3, 123 lbs and 36C. I got the large and it fit pretty well, other than the slight lower back fat problem.", "summary": "Put a tube or bandeau top underneath this suit and it's super sexy.

Measurements are 34\" bust & waist (17 inches across lying flat), and 36\" hips (18 inches across lying flat). Length of dress is 31\" and the cape is approx 6 inches longer than the dress. I guess I didn't notice that before I ordered.\n\nI am giving this 3 stars because I too find that the sizing is off. It's just not doable for average US women. I understand as a nation we are larger than most Asian people but if you are manufacturing clothing to sell abroad, adjust your sizing. Otherwise for me this dress would be a 5 star dress.\n\nThe material is of very good quality (surprising considering the price) and the dress is fully lined! The cape is heavy enough that it is not see-thru. A wonderful dress for a skinny person.\n\nSadly, I will be returning it. Fit great except tight in the bust for me (I wear 34D) and also the cape does not cover your arms for the most part up top like I thought it would.
