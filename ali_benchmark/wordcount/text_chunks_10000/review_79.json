For one, they are much cuter, but they also sit closer up to the chin so that there isn't a lot of space for drool to run down baby's shirt. They're thicker than regular bibs as well, and the snap in the back makes them more secure than the velcro versions. We own two packs of Adovely bibs and they've held up fairly well over the last 4-5 months. These are a little bit bigger than some of the other brands offered, which was noticeable when my son started wearing them at 3 months old, but since then he has grown into them. The photo does make the bibs appear a little bit brighter in color than they seemed in person, but I didn't mind that so much. However, the bibs with red are more orangey in color than I expected. We have both the whimsical and the nautical styles, and I will say that the ones with solid coloring have held up much better than the ones with the white backgrounds. After wearing them every day for months on end, they do tend to take on a yellowish tint where the drool collects, so just keep that in mind when picking out colors if you plan to be as hard on them as we have been.

Not only are they adorable, they are well made and comfortable to wear as well. I haven't washed them yet, but I tried some on and they fit me perfectly. I normally wear a size 6.5M or 7M in U.S. Women's shoes and sock size 9-10. I never could figure out how they came up with the different sock size from shoe size...\nAnyways...so these socks are made in Korea, and they come in one-size-fits all for U.S. women's shoe size 6-9. They do seem to have some stretch to them and they fit me just right. They're snug, but not tight and restricted feeling, nor are they loose in any area. Basically, they fit snug from ankle to toe, but not so tight they leave impressions, or loose where they droop at the ankles or make my feet slip in slide inside my shoes. I so hate when I spend money on socks and they do that. I think these have just the perfect blend of fibers: 80% Cotton, 15% Polyester and 5% Spandex.\nThen, there's the cuteness factor...these are honestly the cutest pairs of socks I have in my possession. I mean, they're so cute, I want to show them to everyone. It's a shame that they aren't visible while I'm wearing shoes, but there is one consolation. Our culture (Japanese) has us always taking our shoes off when we enter a home, so I plan on wearing these whenever I go to a house that has us taking our shoes off first. We used to do that at our house growing up, but stopped after we grew up. In fact, as a kid, I never wore shoes at home...we were always barefoot or in socks. It could be also that because we were so poor, my mom couldn't afford to buy us any. At any rate, these are super cute and comfy and I plan on keeping the Cat & the Panda ones for myself and maybe sharing the others with family members. They're just too cute to not want to share with everyone. Although I received these at a discounted, promotional rate (in exchange for my honest and unbiased review), I find that the price is very reasonable. Especially for the quality, besides being a novelty item. I like the different color stripes too...all on a neutral beige color background. I wish these came in kid's, toddler's and baby sizes, that would be so cute! But then again, there are already so many cute things for them, so it's kinda nice somebody thought about us big boys and girls.", "summary": "These are the cutest socks I've ever bought.", "unixReviewTime": 1465257600}

That being said, I was excited for the opportunity to try this nose ring at a reduced price for my sincere opinion.  On sight I fell in love with the design.  Not your boring plain septum ring (which is fine for some formal events of course), this one not only has jewels, but also rests a bit lower which I like also.  This ring feels very sturdy, and should last for quite some time.  It was very easy to put on, and remove, and did wonders at helping me decide that yes, a septum ring is still something I wouldn't mind having the ability to wear but in the meantime, I am more than happy with this lovely ring, and I plan to have a few others with just as good quality so that I can wear proper designs for proper occasions.  A fun and insightful buy.", "summary": "A Beautiful Quality Nose Ring That Gives The Look W/O Pain AND Can Help You Decide If You Truly Want To Get The Piercing", "unixReviewTime": 1457481600}

It did fit perfectly, I probably could or should have got it a size smaller to make it tighter.  I did wear this on my wedding day under my dress.  It really worked well and kept me tucked in nicely.\n\nSo compared to a name brand body shaper, this one does hold its own.  I wouldn't say top of the line, but if you were wanting to wearing this for everyday or even certain occasions but be able to breathe, then this would work perfect in my opinion.\n\nI didn't have any issues with it rolling up or rolling down.  It stayed in place nicely with my wedding dress.  It is very breathable which is nice.  And it shaped me to give me that hour glass figure.\n\nI really did like it, the only thing I would change is to make it a little bit tighter!\n\n**I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.

I used to use a bowl or cup and it didn't work as well because the tiny brushes were still wet by the next day and the wet brushes kept touching each other.\n\nThe makeup brush holder and dryer arrived in 3 pieces. There is protective filming on the materials that you need to remove showcasing the black sleek look. The product was extremely easy to set up. I have used a variety of different brands in the makeup holder from Japonesque to Eco-tools and they held up well in the elastic and soft rubber holes. The holes wrapped tightly around the brush handle deterring the brush from falling through. If you also don't have time to remove the excess water from your brushes than you can flip the flat part of the makeup holder around so the brushes are facing downward. Overall, in my preference, I wouldn't used the product as a makeup holder because the soft rubber holes do have a good grip so it isn't an easy reach and grab while doing makeup but, works great displaying your brushes and keeping them away from debris on the table. Therefore the holder is stable, none of my brushes touch while wet and it makes it easier to air dry.

She is a pageant contestant. The evening wear dress had to be an \"approved\" floor length dress. My first choice from Macy's was not approved. My second choice from JC Penny's was approved but I decided to look a little further on Amazon. I found my daughters dress! And I did not look any further. The pageant director & her assistant both agreed that this was the perfect dress for my 13 year old daughter. This dress helps to maintain a sense of innocence. Not too revealing, not too 5 year old'ish, not to 20-something, but elegant enough for a 13 year old girl.\n\nSecondly, I needed it quickly. To be exact, I wanted the dress to arrive at my home atleast 10 days before the pageant. So, I changed my order to rush delivery $20 extra plus the $94 for the dress (I budgeted for $115 so I was good with that). I was reassured by customer service that I would receive my daughters dress on time. The dress arrived 3 days early! Another plus!\nThe pageant isn't until Sunday May 1st but she tried it on and she looks like Miss Universe! My husband & I are so pleased.\nThe dress is sturdy, stitched together very well. I purchased her a size 10 but she could definitely wear a size 8. The only alteration needed is under the arm. I think it runs small but my daughter has a small frame so that is why I probably should have ordered the size 8. If I had I would not have to get this small, minor alteration.\nThe dress is beautiful. The fabric is beautiful. The lace at the top was not just seen together w/out care. Someone took their time with this dress.", "summary": "EXCEEDED OUR EXPECTATIONS!", "unixReviewTime": 1461110400}

This fabric is light as air! The legs are not huge but just loose enough to be in the \"harem\" category. I didn't want hugely billowy pant legs, so these were perfect for me. The waist band is an elastic smocking, which you can see in the product image, but I didn't realize that until I got my order---and that is a nice surprise because that is much more comfortable than a single elastic band at the waist. The elastic as the ankles is also softly gathered. I'm going to buy these in a few more colors.\n\nUPDATE: I did buy a second pair, and the back seam allowance on the second pair was so narrow, and the fabric is so (nicely) light weight, that the seam came apart and the fabric unraveled. I would hesitate to buy this again, unless the seam allowance was made wider.

I followed the size chart and the overall fit was exactly what I hoped in a size medium.\n\nThe only thing that surprised me and disappointed me a little was the tightness of the tank top. It is very form hugging and I was hoping it would hang a little more loose on me.. kind of like a workout racerback tank. The form hugging fit was a little uncomfortable, but that was because it was something I am not use to. The sizes are true to the size chart and the design looks awesome!

This hat came in a flat package, so needed to be fluffed and formed again in order to look good, but once I did that it is sufficient for the need I had.  Some of the feathers did fall off as I was attempting to reform the hat, but that is pretty expected when it comes to feathers.  I think that this hat is perfect for a costume or to wear for a Derby party.  It is not of a decent quality though to expect more than one use out of it.

I wear 33 or 34 waist and ordered these in tag XL.  Of the six pair, four fit quite well but two are undersized slightly in the leg opening resulting in a less than deisrable fit.  I may order again and get the XXL, however this is more a quality control issue that anything else I believe.  The ones that are proper fit give you an awesome lift and really make your package very prominent and are quite comfortable.  A good value even considering the fit issue.\n\nSo, a followup review here based on the results of my second order, in XL again. In both orders two of the six pair are seriously undersized.  Interestingly it was the red and yellow pair in both orders.  Not only are they undersized, while the fabric has the same texture as the other colors, it is not the same.  The fabric in the red and yellow has significantly less stretch and give than the other colors which makes the under-sizing issue even more of a problem.

Attached is a picture of it on my own neck, in case you want to see the length on a human. It is a twisted rope style. It is dainty, but durable and well made. The clasp is easy to use, and the chain is very sparkly. The pendant has a large turquoise stone that is extremely sparkly! It catches light very well, and glitters from across the room. The setting for the stone is a four prong, and the stone is well set. The turquoise stone is framed by two overlapping hearts. One is a simple silver outline of a heart. The second heart is made of a bunch of tiny cz stones or maybe Swarovoski clear stones. Whatever they are, they make what would be a pretty necklace - stunning! The necklace is the perfect size of a daily wear necklace. I attached the picture of the pendant in my hand to show the size better in my palm.  I have worn the necklace several days in a row and it is not tarnishing or discolored.\n\nThe Uhibros Sterking Silver Heart Pendant Necklace is a fantastic choice for a gift.

Because the pendents were smaller I was expecting the chain to be a little shorter on my daughter.  it's a longer necklace. I do have one negative, the batman does not sit up like in the picture. It hangs. Taking the effect away a little but the necklace is still very nice. My daughter thoroughly enjoyed it when asked what her favorite part about the necklace was she replied the two charms because they both symbolize Batman so she was really excited about that. It is well made and it has not tarnished her neck as of now.

My son probably would've been happy wearing them even with only one working. But I knew it was only a matter of time before the other shoe would fail as well. They are novelty shoes, made of cheap vinyl. And scuffed VERY easily. But all that aside, I would've kept them if they would've worked longer than two weeks.

(pink one) Okay so I was somewhat skeptical about ordering online, because my body is shaped weird. I have an average sized frame with a very large bust. There wasn't an option to order an XL, so I got a large. This worked out for me. Its slightly tight on me, but that's what I wanted. (I wear a DD bra for reference.) By the way, the bottoms are TINY, and VERY cheeky. But I bought this bathing suit specifically for the top, with no intention of wearing the bottoms, so I'm 100% happy. If you're someone who isn't fond of a tight fit, order one size up. And forget about the bottoms unless you want to wear a thong to the beach! Haha!\nBY THE WAY, shipping was fantastic!! I ordered it on March 16th, and received it on March 24th, only 8 days later! I was really surprised because it said it would take a month to get here.\nAlso, its great quality too.

The button/charger comes up and sticks out of a cut in the material on the inner ankle of both shoes.  first, the button can get mashed a bunch of times while just walking and the wire can slide back into the material.  I sewed the material around the wire to prevent it from sliding back in.  I placed a small over over the button to prevent it from being mashed constantly and changing from colors you choose.  Otherwise the product is perfect and after walking around theme parks, playgrounds and kids parties with them...they are not broken or messed up in any way yet.

The leather is VERY cheap. The price is high for the bad quality of the leather.

The location of the plug for charging is inside the shoe, at the top.  My son loves it because of the lights. You can chose which color you want it on by pressing on a hidden switch inside the shoe. In my opinion, the location of the switch is bad since what happened is that even if you turn it off, while moving or running, my son's foot gets in contact with the switch and it turns on by itself. Since he cannot keep the lights off, he cannot wear them at school since shoes with lights (if they are on) are not allowed. I have seen other brands that placed the switch on the outer side of the shoe, and those are much better. I got the black as well for my younger son (4 and a half years), again, cheap leather. An extra problem with him was since he is younger, its hard for him to place his finger inside the shoe and turn the lights on, or chose colors or turn off the lights by himself. the only nice thing about these are the lights.", "summary": "The price is high for the bad quality of the leather", "unixReviewTime": 1463961600}

This falls into the second category. My daughter wanted a hair tie bracelet for her birthday and there were several different ones on Amazon. The \"brand name\" one was really expensive so I ruled that out. So I ordered a Cari Cuff and several other cheaper ones as my daughter tends to lose things so I figured having a couple backups wouldn't hurt. I also ordered one from Kohls -- it was more expensive than this one so I figured if the Cari Cuff was ok, I'd just return the Kohl's one to the store.\n\nThe whole point of this is to say that this is not one of those \"I got the product for free in exchange for my glowing review\"-type reviews. I purchased this bracelet along with several of its competitors using my own money. And I will say that the Cari Cuff was by far the nicest of all of them. It arrived in a beautiful gift box while the cheaper ones were in cheap plastic bags with barcode stickers on them or in a flimsy velvet drawstring bag with threads hanging out of the seams. The Cari Cuff is sturdy and a nice weight while the cheaper ones were flimsy and easily bent. The hair tie stays on it well while it falls off the cheaper ones all the time. The ends are nicely finished on the Cari Cuff while on the cheaper ones, it is like they were just cut from a long band of metal and not sanded or shaped in any way so they are a bit sharp -- they can scratch both your wrist and your laptop or desk if you lean your wrists against them to type. Comparing the Cari Cuff to the more expensive Kohls bracelet, the Cari Cuff was still the winner - the Kohls one was overly heavy and clunky and had a weird pattern design....and it was HUGE (as in probably would have fit my husband huge). No way would it stay on my daughter's wrist so I ended up returning it.\n\nSo overall the Cari Cuff is heads and tails above all the others I ordered. And perhaps the best testament to that is the fact that it has not left my daughter's wrist since day 2 (after she spent day 1 trying all the different bracelets) -- anything she manages to not lose or misplace is something she really really loves. (And note: after over a month of constant wearing, the bracelet still looks brand new so the finish is holding up great.)\n\nAnd a maybe even better testament is that while I figured I would just wear the cheaper ones that my daughter rejected, after trying to use them all for the last month and being annoyed that the hair ties keep falling off and my wrist and laptop keep getting scratched by the unfinished ends, I am back here ordering another Cari Cuff for myself. (Happy Mothers Day to Me!)\n\nSo if you are trying to decide which of the many hair-tie bracelets here on Amazon is the best value, I would definitely recommend this one. It is a little more expensive than some of the other ones on Amazon, but well worth the extra money!", "summary": "Really nice!

You cant see the size, the material, or the overall quality.  I will admit I was a little skeptical about this outfit as its extremely well-priced and it almost seemed too good to be true.  Ive seen similar outfits for three times as much as this one.\n\nWell, I can say with all honesty that this was well worth it.  First, its just as adorable in person as it is in the product pictures.  Both the shirt and the pants are super soft and you can tell its quality material, not super cheap, stiff, or itchy material.  Its a really nice cotton and the design is so darn cute!  I absolutely love the little tie and you can actually move the little piece on the tie to adjust the tie.  If you are concerned about the little piece coming off, you can just take it off too.\n\nThe suspenders seem to be screen printed on, and it is done very well. I didn't notice any imperfections with the screen printing and I thought the detail on the back of the shirt was a wonderful touch.  As far as sizing, I got the XS which says 1 year and I would say this is equivalent to 12 months so the sizing seems to be pretty correct.  Overall, this is an adorable outfit and I would order from them again!\n\nI received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.", "summary": "Absolutely adorable outfit and the quality is fantastic!", "unixReviewTime": 1458604800}

At first, I was a little skeptical about buying a prom dress online, but I was on a short budget and didn't really have much of a choice. Upon seeing the good reviews that HTYS has, I decided to order this dress from them. I asked the customer service, Jane, LOTS of questions; and she patiently and quickly answered all of them. I gave my exact measurements, and I also asked them to customize the color AND add a shoulder drape for me. And they did  it at no extra cost! The only problem was that I ordered it less than two weeks from our prom and had to choose expedited shipping, so I had to pay a little more. Still, the dress WITH the shipping cost way less than how much others spent buying a dress from an actual dress shop. PLUS, I didn't need to get it altered because when it arrived, it fit perfectly right out of the bag! :D (If you're thinking about how long the dress looks on me, that's probably my fault because I might've been off about my height measurements by a little.)\n\nThe dress itself is GORGEOUS. The beadings are full, and they even gave extra beads just in case some fell off (but none did despite how much I moved around that day). The color, for me, is exactly like the picture, and it is so pretty. The back of the dress has a small trail, also. And the shoulder drape that I requested just made it even more elegant and perfect for me. In addition, it is very comfortable to wear that I didn't even want to take it off after the event, lol!\n\nI received lots of compliments from friends and family during and after prom. And with the overall price that I paid, with customizations and all, it certainly looks and feels like it's worth WAY more than $90! I am so lucky that I found this seller, and I DEFINITELY recommend them to anyone! I'd certainly buy from them again. :)", "summary": "I'm in love with this dress!", "unixReviewTime": 1458086400}

What a emotional day at my house. However, these pants were super comfortable. I am a little thick and petite. The pants were a little long on me but I am use to it by now. They always are and finding petite jeans that fit just right is a hassle. I will say my calves are huge. Like pin up girl cartoon calves, lol. The stretch on these jeans are fabulous and I always have issues looking for jeans that fit in my calves. I basically wear boyfriend jeans as skinny jeans. The hidden elastic band is great. It does not roll down and fits over my belly. I will say I am a fan of the side panel for maternity jeans so if these jeans happen to go that route I will give it 10 stars! The quality of the material is very soft seams durable and they are the same exact color of the one pictured. Usually the color is a little different but these are true to the pics. The stitching is great no loose strings, no frays, the fabric looks of great quality. The jeans are very soft and made of 98% cotton with 2% spandex. I have washed them and they do not shrink and the color was just as bright as when I received them. All together I am very pleased with the purchase of these maternity jeans and the quality of them. You can basically use them to just run errands or go out on a nice night with friends and family.

This Sales Assistant literally leaped out of a store at me, telling me how much she loved it. And it is very shapely, gives you a great bust, as the cups are quite firmly shaped. I did in fact, stuff some wadded up TP in there, as my ladies were looking a little sad, so i gave them a boost. My waist is slimmish, so i had a good curvy girl thing going on.\n\nBut on the whole it's a well made suit, it's made of decent material, not thin, or transparent. it comes in a clear zippered bag, so if you get it wet, you can keep it away from your dry clothes whilst you travel.", "summary": "I'm a Pinup girl!", "unixReviewTime": 1491436800}

I feel like all reviewers should say their height, weight/build and bust size when they say the suit is too small or too large.  There are so many raters saying too small or too large.  Confusing.  I rated that the product \"fits as expected\" because it is truly an XXL and I feel that it would fit a female who normally wears an XXL and they have a quite a large bust (maybe a big C or D?).  I don't wear an US XXL.  Normally, I wear a LARGE (or a US 10, 11 or 12)  in most clothes and most swimming suits.  I ordered XXL based on all of the reviews about the size of this suit running small and the size chart said to try XXL if you wear a US 10-12.  That is not accurate.  I feel that it was too big for me, because I don't wear an XXL.  The torso fit well.  I have about 35 inch waist.  About 43 inches for my hips.  It was slightly roomy but not at all baggy all around.  Fit my behind very well.  Great boy short length. The main problem for me is that the very sturdy formed padded cups for the bust are just way too big for me because I am a small B bust cup.  I used to always wear 2 pieces and I would get a L bottom, but a M top and that worked fine.  I wasn't sure how molded or rigid the padded cups would be so I thought I'd be okay with this, or that I could put gel inserts in, but no.  It's for a very large busted lady and those padded cups would probably be appreciated by a big chest.  I LOVE the style.  I just wish the cups were more forgiving.  I wish I could somehow take out the sturdy cup and have the material just sit on my chest without the rigid padding.", "summary": "Rigid Cups for Large Bust", "unixReviewTime": 1467072000}

I had one back in the 70s and loved it! The jumpsuit was supposed to arrive anywhere from the middle of March to the end of March, but I received it very quickly, however that is where the good news ends. This jumpsuit is not at all like the picture! It is not denim, but a very thin cheap stretch material. The string is in no way long enough to criss cross twice in the back and still tie at the waist! The waist and zipper were also not as pictured, the picture shows a waistband with a button and a heavy duty zipper, these have no button and the cheapest zipper I have ever seen and defective as well, it was very difficult to zip up or back down.  Since it was coming from China, I ordered a size twelve (12) when I am usually a size six (6), it fit, but it was snug. After reading the other reviews, I can't believe we are all reviewing the same garment! I am 5'2\" so I expected to need to hem, but one reviewer stated at 5'9\" they hit her at her knee? Even if I was 6'2\" these would have been long enough to wear with a 4\" heal! I wonder how much it will cost to return this to China?", "summary": "VERY DISSAPPOINTED!", "unixReviewTime": 1487203200}

They hit the floor with enough room to wear with a little wedge shoe.\n\nNow let's talk about the fit as these run small. I ordered an 18 and they are still a little too snug, I will need to wear a body shaper under these.  That being said; my boyfriend said they look great on the backside which is a plus as sometimes the rear on the curvy gals gets a little smashed with certain garments but these have great stretch!\n\nOk lastly, the string set up is a little confusing to get into, especially when your wearing it. I ended up laying the garment on my bed and pulling up the photo to figure out how to tie it. It comes with one long string (over 7 feet) that you pull at the top to make pleates and then weave down your back. I decided that I  liked the lift it gives you by tieing the top part as a halter so I cut the string in two. The smaller piece for the top and the longer piece for the back. Plus this makes it WAY easier to put on and I think it gives a more flattering fit.\n\nHope this helps. :-)", "summary": "Lightweight, stretchy and comfy!", "unixReviewTime": 1462838400}

The fit was very accurate to the sizing chart provided. Some things to note--\nFirst, the cups that are sewn in are ridiculously small and  kind of in an odd place. I took mine out with two quick cuts and it looks soooooooo much better. The fabric is firm enough and thick enough that you do not need those weird little cups.\nSecond, the bow in the front has two different lengths hanging. I don't know why but again it was an easy fix. I just cut mine and did a few stitches to make them the same size. Easy.\nThird, the seam around the waist wasn't fully done on  my dress. Which was weird. It just had two spots where it looked like they forgot to sew the seams together. It was also a super easy fix if you know how to do some very basic sewing (or use youtube).\nFourth, the lace up back allows you to adjust the dress perfectly to your curves. I love this so much and it really sold me on the dress. You definitely need help getting laced up properly but the effect is stunning.\nSo overall I loved the dress BUT it was not perfect straight from the bag. If the idea of doing a little sewing scares you this is not the dress for you. If you can handle it I more than recommend. Once I finished my dress it looked way way more expensive than it was. The fabric is really nice and the fit is beautiful. It is so worth the price. I got so many compliments and people asking where I got it. Also, it HAS POCKETS!!", "summary": "Beautiful dress but needs a little help", "unixReviewTime": 1537488000}

A size small fits well and it hits me just below the knee. It is asian sizing so chose accordingly and pick a size up if needed.\n\nOverall, this is a nice basic dress, that has lots of perks, and it's easy to care for.

Although the fabric is pretty basic, its not sheer, and you really can't see through it (although black panties may not be the best choice with this dress, obviously!).The stitching is surprisingly sturdy, so I don't imagine this will just fall apart after a few wash cycles, like some items like this tend to.

I normally wear a 3XL, which fits comfortably. I can occasionally wear 2XL on shirts that are cut large. A regular 2XL will be somewhat snug. I had meant to order an XL and an L to try each (at this price, what the heck). By error I ordered a 2XL and an XL.\n\nImmediately upon opening I realized that they felt different from other compression / slimming undershirts. I rechecked the product page and realized that I had also missed the product material description. 100% nylon. Well, nylon simply is NOT going to provide the compression force necessary to accomplish anything useful. Then I put the shirt on and noted that it was simply like a tighter cut regular 2XL. I did not note ANY compression effects. Also, it was just as warm (hot even) as any other compression / slimming undershirt that i have had - and is not to any extent \"breathable\". In fact, this will now become an undershirt for when I workout to help stimulate warmth and sweating.\n\n(I think that - for those who remember the old Banlon Shirts - it accomplished about as much as wearing a tight-cut 2XL Banlo would have!)\n\nWhen I try out the XL version, I will update this Review. I really don't expect much improvement other than it should obviously be tighter.\n\nThe main problem isn't so much with the sizing as with the product material. Other shirts of this type are usually part nylon and part other material (usually spandex), such as 90% nylon and 10% spandex or 85% nylon and 15% spandex. Something along those lines.\n\nThat will likely affect my Star Rating (downwards) if that is the case. I only gave it a 3-Star at this point because of the fact that getting the 2XL was MY fault.\n\nUPDATE 4/18/22017:\n\nAfter trying the XL, I have to downgrade to a ONE-STAR rating.\n\nThis does no compression at all. I am not that \"fat\", having previously competed in regional powelifting and boxed locally.before that as a super heavyweight. Competitively up to 18-20 years ago when I was 6'0\" / 250. Over the last 15 years or so, have gradually gone up to abut 275, mostly around upper torso (a bout with Pseudo Cushings starting 12 years ago boosted that up to over 315 for a couple of years until brought under control, thanks to a visit to NIH in MD, and have been easing weight back down). But when going out to something more than local errands, I prefer to wear an undergarment compression t-shirt to do just that..... compress.  And also help provide tension to provide back and abs support.\n\nThis product does NOT do that!\n\nAll compression shirts seem to lose that compression over a period of time (just as do compression socks - worn due to a DVT a few years ago - even when worn only about 50% of the time). This brand isn't even as good as compression shirts over a year old!\n\n(BTW... a hint for longevity to compression socks or shirts is to have sevderal pair, rotate them frequently, and truly handwash and air dry!)", "summary": "Sizing Could Be Better - But MAIN Problem is Material", "unixReviewTime": 1491609600}

This is a box set of 4 organizers for different uses and items.\n\nWe chose these to aid in organizing our many socks and personal items within our closets and drawers. These come with a zipper for collapsible storage (as you will see in the photos). These fit in drawers nicely and can be placed on shelves in the closet etc. We suggest more of using them in drawers than as a slide in and out on shelves. The sides are sturdy for what they are and the interior boxing is very flexible to allow for thicker to thinner socks, ties and delicates. The seams are sturdier than they appear, however if you were to cram anything inside them, the material may rip if too much is forced inside.\n\nWe bought these thinking they were a heavier build, however, they are on the flimsier side.\n\nThese are not the best quality drawer organizers, however they are decent for what they are. More of a box store brand than a high end brand.\nWe would recommend them for college students who need to organize for extra space and for the smaller items such as underwear, socks, nylons and even for bathroom storage of make up supplies and so forth. But not for the kids who cram items inside. More for the organized kids who take care of their belongings.  Not a bad little set to have, but if you are seeking organizers that are more boxy, with little flexibility, these may or may not work for you.\n\nAs product testers, we received a discounted price on this product to give our honest and unbiased review of said product. Our reviews come from hands on testing and are not influenced by the seller. Nor are we affiliated with the seller or Amazon in any way. Pictures have been included for your convenience.

ValuableService advertises these as  organizes for the selves you hang in your closet, seeing as they work wonderfully for me to make use of unused space in my dresser I feel they will work well when used for their intended purpose as well.\n\nPros:\nEasy to put together, great size, easy to organize your delicates or a variety of other items.\n\nCons:\nThe bottom is just cloth so it is not very sturdy.

They absolutely work size-wise. They fit perfectly and don't show at all. The designs are cute--actually much cuter than I expected. I'm not usually one for animal prints, so I was relieved to see that not all of them were animal print and those that were actually weren't as tacky as those designs often look. Unfortunately, there are a couple of other issues with them that prevented me from being able to give them 5 stars. They seemed reasonably well-made, but one sock ripped towards the toe upon first wear. It may have gotten snagged a little on the inside of my shoe or something, but it really ripped quite a bit. I haven't had the same issue with any other pairs yet, but feel the need to be honest about the fact that it happened with one pair. They also tend to slide off my feet. I wear a size 7 1/2-8 in shoes normally and they feel like they are fitting as intended, but I have had major issues keeping them on my feet when walking around all day. Aside from that, though, they are very comfortable. They are a thin, soft material. I've had no issues with them shrinking when washed, and the colors have also stayed vibrant. I'm not sure if it's just my feet, but these things fall down into my shoes all day long! I really wanted to love them, but they just don't do the job easily.

I was pleasantly surprised how roomy it is and how much stuff I can fit in it.  It's just the right size for an overnight bag, however, I have been using it as a diaper bag.  It's not huge or heavy, has lots of pockets to keep baby stuff, toddler stuff and my stuff, and the best part is my husband doesn't mind carrying it because it doesn't look girly or like a purse!  WIN!\n\nThere are two end zip pockets that are very nice in size, a zip pocket on the backside of the bag, two nice sized pockets on the front  that velcro shut and a partition inside to keep things orderly.  Inside there is a small zipper pocket on one wall, a middle zippered compartment that creates a partition and two open pockets on the other wall. This bag has the option to carry it by two  handles on top or by a removable, adjustable chocolate brown shoulder strap, which complements the mocha color of the bag.  The shoulder strap easily hooks to loops on each side and adjusts to your preference, including rotating so the straps never get twisted.  My bag has a few threads that I need to snip off but otherwise is well made, sturdy and stitched well.\n\nI really really REALLY love this bag and I would highly recommend it.  It is a great bag with tons of room and is quickly becoming my most favorite bag for any occasion.\n\nI received this bag at a discounted price for testing purposes and for my honest review. The opinions in this review are 100% my own based on my personal experience with the product.  I made no commitment to leave a positive review and rated this bag as I would any other product - based on quality, value, functionality and my preferences.", "summary": "I love this bag!", "unixReviewTime": 1459296000}

Some of the sequins could have been sewn tighter as they ended up twisted backwards because the thread was too loose. It was easy enough to correct but will be something to watching moving forward as the sequins thread might continue to loosen. I will update my review if this occurs.

She literally got stopped twice in the parking lot at dinner and was complimented on the dress and was better then anything we saw in the store and 1/3 of the price. Although her measurements suggested she needed a size 6, I felt that would be too big so I got her the 4. She is 5'9 and 130 pounds with a very long athletic frame...not a lot of curves (she's 15). This is why I went 1 size down. The dress fit her perfectly everywhere but was a shade tight right under the arms. Someone with less of a lean frame then her should probably order more true to the size chart. The only other thing I'd say is the dress is meant to be long and drag the floor a bit. The dress would be a nightmare to hem so I'd bear that in mind and make sure that the length won't bother you. You will need to steam the dress after it arrives as the chiffon will wrinkle.

My daughter tried on dozens of dresses for Prom and this dress was unbelievable.  It was absolutely the ;most gorgeous dress I have ever seen and it fit perfectly.  The top bodice was filled with so many gems and sequins that it helped make the dress fit and hold up extremely well and on top of that I believe there was a build in corset.  I cannot say enough good about this dress.  My only wish was that they had other colors sold in Prime.  They have this same dress in about 12 other colors but the orange one was the only one available in Prime which meant we could get it in 2 days versus 3-4 weeks for all the others.\n\nBottom line if you like this style - this is the company to buy from.  My daughter loved this dress but wanted it in Dark Navy Blue which they didn't offer in Prime so we had to purchase this same style from another company because they were the only ones who could have it delivered by the date we needed, which still took about 2-3 weeks using rush delivery.  The dress we got was beautiful, but we paid more and it wasn't even close to the quality of these dresses.  For example in the back there is a zipper near the bottom and then the lace corset on the back which really helps hold things together on the other dress there was no zipper at the bottom it just had the lace go all the way down which made it so it didn't fit as well.  Also the top bodice didn't have near the amount of beading that this one does.  Trust me if you like this style this is the one to buy.  Just make sure your order early, like a month in advance.", "summary": "The PERFECT DRESS! My daughter tried on dozens of dresses ...", "unixReviewTime": 1462406400}

I would suggest a skin colored bra or cup inserts as this dress is just sheer enough to see your nips (if you go braless). The bottom half of the dress is a little tricky. Super high slit that went up to my hip bone, but it's tight enough where it doesn't shift! But, the back part of the dress is cut weird and doesn't really lay down flat towards the body.

By the time I was able to give it to her she'd had a growth spurt jumping up to a size 6X, so I was concerned it wouldn't fit her. Thankfully, it's a perfect fit!\n\nThis outfit is made in China. It arrived with no chemical smell and no loose seams. The top is so thin she'll wear it with a white cami underneath, not only because it's a bit see through but also because she'd be too cold without one.\n\nThe belt and shorts are material I'd wear, haha.

I wish this came in my size ;)\n\nI ordered the size 5/6 for my very tall and thin three year old.  She is 44\" tall and 40 lbs. The beautiful heather-grey shorts are bunched appearance, with an elastic waist and a matching belt.  This style is great for my thin daughter, where length is typically an issue if I want the bottoms to fit her waist.  These shorts look like a skirt when on, but with an active toddler, give the privacy that shorts offer.  These come mid thigh on her.\n\nThe shirt is a very elegant sheer light cream color.  It comes nice and long and the back is a couple inches longer than the front.  Due to the light-weight material, even though my daughter is thin, this shirt falls against her and does not look too wide (like many of her shirts).  The arm holes are a little wide, but since the material is sheer, she will already be wearing an undershirt with this, so that is not an issue for us.  The collar is made of the same material as the shorts, so it all ties in beautifully together.  The back of the shirt has a hidden delicate zipper, with a sweet little pearl button closure at the top.  Very cute addition when my daughter has her hair in a high bun.\n\nThis outfit is extremely well made - not a thread out of place!  The style is versatile enough that my daughter will get at least a couple years out of it!  Very pleased with this purchase.  I plan on having my daughter wear this for Easter, with a button down sweater.  I can already predict all of the compliments she will be receiving from relatives - it is a very cute and elegant outfit!\n\nI was fortunate to have received this product at a discounted price.

I usually wear a small in swimsuits, but the band was way too loose on the top. The cups were probably slightly smaller than a regularly sized small. They aren't adjustable so even if I were to tighten the band it didn't work. I didn't even bother to try on the bottom, but it looked like the material was a little thin.

I'm a little bummed because my body type is rather bottom heavy-- I'm pretty tiny on top but definitely have a booty and thighs. This put me in an awkward place because it felt like I was between sizes, and there's not an option to mix and match. I decided to go smaller rather than bigger (rookie mistake), and while the top fits perfectly, the bottom is cutting into my hips (not cute).  I can ameliorate this with other bottoms, but I wish I could've worn the set! Overall, great material, great color, great option if you have a normally proportioned body :) ps-- Looks and feels exactly like a triangl suit! I have one from years ago and literally cannot tell a difference in quality.\n\nNote: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.

I am 5/6 and 128 pounds and my breasts are a  38 and it fit me.\n\n The dress is absolutely beautiful with shiny blue. I was very impressed and I thought the quality was pretty good. It's thinner material  than I thought but it definitely is much shinier than I thought and it looks beautiful with black heels.\n\n I've worn it twice now. I wore out with my girlfriends with black heels and black nylons and I looked amazing and then I went on a date with my husband and wore it  with black leggings and a little black sweater over it and it was absolutely adorable.\n\nSo it's kind of versatile.... you can wear it as a dress or kind of is a halter top with a nice little sweater assemble over it. The material is thin yet you can't see through it but not thin enough neither will tear easily.\n\nWhat I like about it is that at the material is stretchy so after night of eating and drinking you have a little room to move in!.\n\nWhen I had it on with my leggings and my little black sweater assemble I got several several compliments about how well and how cute the outfit it was.\n\n When I first took it out of the package I didn't think it was going to be as cute or pretty until once you got it on. Once I put it on and accessorize it with everything it made an absolutely beautiful outfit. So I can say that without a doubt this dress did exceed my expectations and the fact that I could wear it two different ways and it look nice both ways and it fit me perfect.\n\nWhen I wear this dress I had no problem with it trying to creep up in the back over my butt or sliding down over my breasts. The dress stayed up where it was supposed to and stayed down where  it was supposed to...\n\n I am going to be posting pictures when this review goes live so that you can see how nice it looks on.\n\nDisclaimer I was offered this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review for which I have given", "summary": "Versatile...makes 2 different outfits", "unixReviewTime": 1458345600}

You can tell what type of underwear I'm wearing.\n\nI did find it to be stretchy and the dress seemed to be well constructed though a simple design. The top band was not tapered or contoured in as something that's going to lay above the boob area should be, so it slides down as you move. The top band also doesn't have any additional elastic to help keep it in place. Since I had purchased this to wear to work it could still be appropriate for nights I work behind the counter at the nightclub, but I don't think I can wear it as I would be pulling it up all night to keep my chest covered. Would be great for someone super skinny, shorter then 5'0\" and kind of small chested. I got the red dress and am absolutely in love with the color!\n\nI received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest review.

All opinions are my own.  I want to say that I was a little hesitant about this bag.  I've never had anything that was genuine leather and I'm not real familiar with the care.  I decided to get it anyways because I needed something to carry my netbook, my Nintendo 2DS, and my movies to and from work on the overnights.  I received this bag this morning in the mail and while I was super excited to try it out, I was a little disappointed when I realized the only thing in the bag was just the backpack, not care instructions.  I figured I could find care instructions on the internet, even though that's a little bit of an inconvenience, totally worth it for such an awesome backpack.  This really is a cool little pack.  I was honestly surprised by the amount of stuff it can hold.  I have in it right now a netbook, 4 DVD cases, a Nintendo 2DS, the netbook charger, the 2DS charger, and I still have a BUNCH of room that I could put stuff in there.  This backpack has 3 external zippered pockets, 2 internal zippered pockets, 2 small internal pouches, and 2 large internal compartments.  I was seriously shocked by the amount of \"hidey\" space in this bag.  I want to mention that the magnetic clasp seems very sturdy, like it will hold up to a good amount of abuse (which is great considering I intend to use it everyday!)  I like that you can adjust the shoulder straps to suit your need.  I feel like these straps could be used on a child, as well as an adult.  I'm a large person and they adust out big enough that I'm very comfortable wearing this product around.  Now that I've got the pros of this bag out of the way I'd like to point out a few things I'm not particularly happy with.  First, I don't like the color.  While it is true to the images on Amazon, it's just not a very attractive color in my opinion.  I feel like a darker brown would have been more attractive.  This bag does come in blue and black also, so that's a plus.  Second, this is genuine leather.  It does have a leather odor.  It's not a pleasant smell, in my opinion.  Some people like it, I believe, but not me.  Other than that I really do like this bag.  I definitely like it a lot more than I originially thought I was going to.  All in all I can definitely say I'm really impressed with the space inside this bag and would recommend it to anyone, really.  Don't think it's especially a \"child's\" bag but could definitely be used as one if you've got a kid that likes leather.

I really wish that there was an option to purchase these things separately .... or that we could have a couple mixed size options for those whose proportions are not \"standard\". The bottoms fit me very well and really helped to accent the curves nicely. The garments are both are nicely stitched, well structured and very comfortable.\n\nI still love this design so I may have to either add some cutlets or find some way to get the top to work for me.... because I really want to wear this to a party that I'm going to in a few weeks. All I need is some big framed sunglasses and a wide-brimmed had and some bright red lipstick and I'll have the whole Retro look going on!\n\nI received this for free in exchange for my time to work with this product so I can write a fair and honest review... however, I only accept review items I need so I can give them a real trial, and thus my opinions and experiences are a real and true reflection of my experience with the product. I have received no compensation and I don't have any kind of personal/business relationship with the seller.

Also the product said gray, it's taupe at best, It almost feels a little short, but when I bent over you can't see my behind so that's good :)\n\nBUT, It is really cute. It is not see-through which was my first concern, I was surpirised! The only warning I will give with this dress is that it is not forgiving, anywhere, at all.

I really like it. Due to its simple and neutral style, its one of those shirts you can pair with various other clothing items to create new outfit styles and many fresh looks.\n\nThe shirt has a modest round neckline and half-length sleeves that are styled to look like they are rolled up. The folded cuffs only serve to give the T-shirt dress a nicer casual and more effortless look. The color I ordered is a neutral light taupe beige color and due to the neutral color, it looks nice either by itself or pairs well with other clothing.\n\nThe sizing seems to run slightly small, so I recommend you order a size larger if you like a looser fit like I do. The material of this piece is 95% cotton and 5% spandex, giving this shirt dress a smooth light feel to it while still having some stretch. The material is a bit thin but is in no way sheer or see-through. It is super comfortable and smooth and a great piece to wear during warmer climates.\n\nWhat I like about this piece of clothing is its versatility. You can wear it as a light casual T-shirt dress in the summer, pair it with a coat or cardigan in the fall and winter, and even turn it into a tunic but pairing it with some skinny jeans or tights whenever you want.  With some different jewelry pieces, accessories, or even a belt, you can turn this dress/tunic into many different outfits, all for a very reasonable and inexpensive price.\n\nI received a sample of the taupe dress for testing and use and I will definitely be going back and purchasing some of the other colors. This is a great find!", "summary": "Wonderful Versatile Casual T-shirt Dress or Tunic! Great Price and Find for Many Different Outfits!", "unixReviewTime": 1466294400}

However, the color is taupe. Its made with 95% cotton and 5% spandex. The material is very lightweight but not see though. Its extremely comfortable like an oversized tshirt. I ordered the largest size that was available at the time which is a Large. It does fit snug in the stomach area so an XLarge would have fit much better. My bust is about 40 around and I wear a 38D. The top portion fits ok but I like my tops fairly loose.\n\nThis top does have a good amount of stretch to it. I really like the tshirt neckline so its not low-cut. The sleeves are long and loose fitting. They hit right at my elbows and they have a 1 fold over cuff. The cuff is only attached in the under seam. So you may have to press down the sleeves for them to stay folded.\n\nMeasurements of Large\n\nChest: 19.75 wide\n\nWaist: 17.5 wide\n\nSleeves: 10 long\n\nLength: 32 long\n\nTheres a straight hem with double stitching. This length might make a good dress for those that are petite. However, for tall people like myself, its best to wear as a tunic. This is a fairly basic top so it can be worn in many ways. You can leave it long and wear with leggings. You can even scrunch it up around the waist and pair it with jeans. Another great way is to dress it up with a cardigan. Its a great versatile top. Being lightweight, you can wear it year around because a cardigan can be worn over it for cooler month.

The Carbon Fiber inlay is vibrant with the a shiny red color interwoven as well as two bright and thin metal strands that go the full circumference.  There isn't a rough edge to be found on this ring, and it is very comfortable to wear with very smooth surfaces and a nice rounded inner area. There are no engravings, imprints, or markings of any kind anywhere on or inside the ring band, just as an fyi.  It is not a very bulky ring either, which I like, and it has a very low profile on your finger.  Every time the light hits it I see a new area of the design that I like in the inlay, and the resin covering the inlay is crystal clear.  Overall, I'm happy with this ring, it's style, it's quality, and certainly it's price for all of the above! I can easily recommend this to anyone looking for this style of rings.

This product did have one anywhere!  Not even on the companys website! So I purchased 2 sizes (after learning that I can return the product for free) to determine the fit.  I am 56, weight 132 pounds, have a 33 waist (thats all the better I can do after having 4 kids), and have 37 hips.  The sizing charts on all the pants/shirts products both on Amazon and the companys website have very skinny waists.  I bought a medium and a large.  Both fit.  The large, however, made my hips look too big.  The way the skirt hangs makes the hips flair/stick out on the sides too much.  So I stuck with the medium.  I could probably get away with a small, but nothing is worse than having something too tight.  So, when determining size with leggings/skirts, I personally would go with the hip measurements, not the waist measurement.  The 28/29 waist fit around my 33 waist no problem and it is not overly snug.\n\nThis skirt if very comfortable and the leggings can be adjusted to how long you want them.  If you want it to look like you are just wearing a nice skirt, you can pull the leggings up to your knees . . . and it is still comfortable.\n\nSince these are leggings, not loose shorts, there is no attached brief inside.  You can wear your own underwear, wear nothing, or purchase an official swim brief (for fast drying purposes).\n\nA couple things about the skirt that I did not know:\nThere are ties on the inside side of the skirt and the outside side of the leggings. These ties can be tied together when swimming to keep the skirt from floating up.  When the ties are untied, the ties are short enough that they are not hanging down past the bottom of the skirt.\n\nCons:\nWhile the elastic in the waistband is nice and wide, it seems to twist every time I put the skirt on.  Every time I put it on I have to manipulate the elastic so that it lays flat in the casing.  This is no big deal because I am going to put 2 or 3 small cross-stitches in the waist band to keep the elastic from twisting every time I take it off or put it on.  Once it is on, the elastic doesnt twist.  And you cant really tell too much from the outside when it is twisted because the elastic is loose inside the waist band, so the waist band still lies flat.\nAlso, it might just be how I am built, but there are a few wrinkles/puckers in the skirt between my waist and the top of my butt.  The skirt is well built, in that it doesnt look like that should happen, and it lies nice and flat everywhere else.  Maybe my but sticks out too much? Or maybe the material wasn't pulled up high enough in the waist band when they sewed it together? Anyway, I don't think this is a big deal because I am wearing a swim shirt or tankini top that will cover it up (even when I raise my hands all the way up).", "summary": "have a 33 waist (thats all the better I can do after having 4 kids)", "unixReviewTime": 1459123200}

I NEVER would have wasted my time and tied up my $$$ on a black leather jacket with brown zippers, even if they were all the same color. The worst part is that they couldn't even settle on a single color hardware, but put THREE DIFFERENT COLORS on the same item. It looks plain awful. I included several pictures of the actual item I received to help anybody decide if they would want to order such a thing, at any price...I wouldn't pay $10 for this with all the different color hardware on it.

It's literally a car seatbelt that's brown and has 2 loops. So it is a bit nicer than the regular cloth belts, but it is also a lot harder to tighten as the seatbelt material slips and you have to tightly hold it with one hand and use a lot of force to pull with the other hand.

It is nice to know what you are ordering, and in this case you can rest assured that you are getting what expect.\n\n2) this fabric is silky. I expected a cotton dress, and I am not sure why, but the fabric is really quite comfortable and wonderful. I really like how it  looks and the fabric seems to have taken the print nicely with no running in the dye at all. This is an awesome fabric for the dress and is lightweight and will be cute and comfortable for summer wear.\n\n3) the dress is fully lined. I really like this option as it is a white base, so it is nice that the dress isn't see through! Additionally this is nice as it hides the seams and makes it so the child isn't bothered by them all day long. We all hate when clothes are itchy and lumpy. YUCK! This one isntt, and that is nice!\n\nCons:\n\n1) this dress is a bit wide. This is probably not a huge deal to most, but my daughter is a bit of a twig, so it does hang a bit oddly around the chest and waist. This is ultimately ok as she wears this one for everyday use and finds it comfortable. It would likely fit a little girl who is a bit more solid as well.

It doesn't fit skin tight now. The material is thick and had some stretch to it, so it has some nylon on it. This might get hot in the summer, but for cool nights in the summer, this would be a cute dress. I love the patterns on this. The patterns on the arms give this a sort of Renaissance feel; the patterns on the stomach create a slimming effect and creates this illusion of an hourglass figure. The dress is mystical looking, yet is vibrant with its different colors overlaying on the black. It fits to my mid thigh level. So, because of the loose size and the rounded neckline, this is a much more modest dress than expected. I wear it with a pair of leggings. I recommend it. Other than the sizing option, the dress is made of thick material and is super stylish and cute. I have no other concerns or complaints.\n\nA video will be uploaded soon.

Sizing with this is a bit small as this large fits like what a US medium size normally would for her but this dress fits her size well.  If you are a larger than a 4/6, then this large dress will not fit as the material does not really stretch much, if at all.  The dress is comfortable in the chest area and the underarms and the sleeves which are sort of a half sleeve length fit at the bend of the elbow like the dress is supposed to do.  The dress is made of polyester and the quality is ok considering the price but the dress isn't as soft as some dress made of higher quality material.  Even with the material not as soft as she would like, she feels the dress is fairly comfortable to wear.  Although I personally don't like the way the dress looks, the wife likes the colorful pattern which gives it a unique look.  The seams of the dress are sewn well with no issues.

I had hesitations after reading reviews online about the quality of ROMWE's clothing. When it came in, I was expecting the worst, but the dress itself wasn't actually that bad. There were a few threads that were fraying, which was annoying, and there was absolutely no way the dress could be worn without a slip. All in all though, it wasn't that bad for how much it cost. I ended up returning it because I needed it for a specific event and didn't want to pay more for a slip when I could just buy a different white dress, but if you're just buying it for fun, I think it's pretty cute!

It does wrinkle a bit, but wrinkles will steam or iron out well. You could wear wrinkle if you want. You could even wash and twist tightly and dry to give it a gauze effect.

There were a number of dangling threads that needed to be trimmed which were no big deal. Also it had a 1 1/2\" opening in a seam that needed to be sewn. It was in the lining and since I can sew it was an easy fix. I would suggest inspect the dress before wearing or washing. The mustard color was the same as shown.

The size, however, is where Im stuck. Its a little larger than I expected so I requested a different size for a replacement- great customer service by the way! Based on the coat alone- I really really like it. The print is dope and the colors are beautiful. I plan to wear this through fall and bust it back out in spring. The color combo lends itself to pretty much any season and its pretty thin so itll work as a windbreaker or with some layers. Its a great bomber coat without the heavy feel. I only took off a star because the sizing was off and I really wanted to wear it to church and couldnt. The sleeves were long and the torso was a little longer than most bomber styles would be. Im a short gal but I tried to follow the sizing information and it wasn't as accurate as I thought. Otherwise this would be 5 stars.\n\nIll update when I receive my corrected size coat.

I'm a 36G, but I wear a size 8/10 in regular clothes so I'm not huge or anything.  The bust, waist and length are awesome, stretchy soft material I'm really happy with that portion.  I don't think I have especially fat arms or anything, but these arms were SOOOOOO TIGHT i am sure I would have started turning blue if I kept them on.  So, I just cut the part that makes it too tight on the bottom (as I've done for friends in the past to alter their clothes) and it made a big difference.  I definitely kept it because I like the color, the style and the price was good!

My experience with this seller has been subpar, by far.\n\nI did purchase this shirt at a discount in exchange for my review.  So here is the review of what I received (despite it not being what I ordered).\n\nThe product that I received was a light blue t-shirt with a London double decker bus on it.  The brand is Little Maven.  It is made in China and shipped from China.  It came in a size 4T which looks about the right size for a 4T, but cant be too sure because my two year old is just now starting to wear 3T and I do not have much in the size of 4T in which to compare.\n\nThe dashed yellow line and the words BUS STOP are embroidered on the shirt.  The double decker bus with the windows and tires and sign are additional pieces of fabric sewn on top of the shirt.  It does look nice.\n\nA nice bonus feature is that the neckline/collar of the shirt can be expanded by undoing two snaps along the shoulder.  I can value this because my son always fights me when a shirt collar is a little snug getting it over his head.\n\nThe care tag says its 100% cotton exclusive of the decoration of the shirt.\n-Wash before wear\n-Machine wash warm with like colors\n-Use only non-chlorine bleach when needed\n-Tumble dry medium\n-Warm iron if needed\n\n** I received this product at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest opinion.

What a very well-made dress this is!  I have heard so many praises with this dress and all of those came from my wife as I bought this for her.  She absolutely loved this one.  She was so happy to get it and she was very much impressed with the quality of this dress.  There were some dresses that disappointed her due to the mismatch that it features online and then upon getting it for real, it was way off what it was suppose to look or the material was cheap.  But this dress is really nice.  The color and the design is so pretty and attractive.  This fitted her perfectly, it snuggled her petite body so nice,  It looked exactly just like the photo online.  The length and the cut were also just right.  She loved how elegant and classy it looked - perfect for all season.  The belt that came with it was detach which is nice as there is so much ease in putting it on.  The material of this dress is good, the cloth is not thin, the thickness is just right.  It is a bit stretchy but it is the kind of stretchy that would retain its original size and shape, thus there is no worry of it loosening up.  She already washed and dried this in the machine and there were no wearing and tearing nor color fading.  Another good thing that made her happier was that she will not need any pressing or ironing on this one as it did not come out wrinkly at all after being dried.  We are highly recommending this lovely dress as it will be truly worthy your money.\nI was able to get this very nice item on a discount and I am glad to share to you all as well my fair and honest feedback about it.", "summary": "Beautiful,lovely, high quality dress", "unixReviewTime": 1465430400}

The colors are bright and cheerful and the quality doesn't feel cheap at all! I adore this bathing suit, and went right to the pool when it arrived. It runs small, so definitely go a few sizes up. I usually wear a US 16 because my butt is bigger than my top, and reading one review said that a 3X was a great fit for a 16, but I was cautious and went for a 4X. The chest area is too big, (which is fixable by adjusting the halter tie) and it provides great support. It's baggy around my stomach, but fits snug across my hips. If you have bigger hips, plan for a larger size, because that upper thigh squish is the most uncomfortable thing about bathing suits, and with this one, the back is the only part that doesn't stretch, so it's best to be on the safe side.", "summary": "Gorgeous swimsuit, size up if you have wider hips.", "unixReviewTime": 1485302400}

I went by the \"chart\" they asked us to use & really wish I had used the manually typed one. Especially considering I usually wear a size 3/4 in women's or a 5 in juniors. I ordered a size UP on the chart due to the measurements given. Looking at the bottom chart, I should have gotten an XL. However if I had done that, the bottoms would be HUGE. Those fit great in a medium!\n\nGood luck getting a top & bottom that fit since they are so vastly different in sizes. Maybe at least you have a shot of getting the proper size with this review.\n\nThe color was true to the picture & the style was great.

Based on the published size chart we went with a Large even though in most normal suits sold in the US in size ranges a small is the perfect size.  The top is listed to fit a  31.5 to 35.4 bust, and the waist a 26.7-30.7.  With a normal bra size of 36C I thought the top might be a bit snug but its much to large and fits rather loose.  With a 27.5\" waist I thought the bottoms would be loose, but they are too snug.  I think with the bottoms the problem might be that they don't actually make it to the waist, they sit low on the hips so if you have any hips or butt they will be to small. I am not sure how I could tactfully say that if you are under 20 and blessed (or augmented) up top but not on the bottom and say a size 2 that the Large I received would be the perfect fit.  The only reason I can see for the top is they do say in the product listing to allow for nearly 2 inches of size variation.  Do they realize that the difference between a small and a large is less than that? I think my set is plus 1\" in the top and minus 2\" in the bottom. If they weren't labeled I would suspect that it was just a one size suit but they clearly have labels with the sizes on them. If they are all cut the same I would suspect that the perfect fit would be a small top without the pads and an extra large bottom.  Its a complete shame because the suit is extremely cute and I love the clasp back and sexy look of the webbing on the top while still providing good coverage and it prevents any chance of spill over if you are active in your suits. Because of the design the top can still work but I will have to find a matching white bottom which sucks because I love the string side detail. The materials and construction seem to be really quite good, its just the sizing that seems to be way off.  if it were't for how good looking the top is I would probably give it a lower rating.

It looked perfect for hanging out by the pool but even better, vacationing on the beach.  So I just had to get it.  To be honest, I got the bathing suite a size too small, which is totally my fault because it does say that the sizes may run smaller. However, I gave the suit to my friend who is about 2 sizes smaller than I am and it fit her perfectly.  She did have a bit of a pouch in her lower abdomen, which totally did not show that much when wearing the bathing suite.  It really slims your core and hides the folds and pouches in your mid section. Another thing about the bathing suit I love is the fact that you can wear it with or without the straps. Either way it works. My friend is a D cup size for bras so the top part of the bathing suite did not hold completely without the strap. So she felt more comfortable wearing it with the strap but I am definitely getting a bigger size fore myself. I cant wait. I would definitely recommend this bathing suite to anyone looking for style, fashion and a perfect fit.

I had my eye on this Swim suit since last summer and I am very happy to finally have it! I am a fan of bathing suits that are still sexy while hiding the imperfections in your tummy. I have had 3 kids and well Lets just say I don't have a six pack LOL! It took about 2 weeks to get to me but It was all good. The quality of this item was so worth the price. It is very nicely made and you can tell it will hold up for the summer in the pool. The only problem I would say is that it runs a little small. I am a size medium and it is a little snug on me. The chest fits good though. I have a C and they fit in the top perfectly. So if you have a bigger chest, I would recommend going a bit bigger. All around I am very happy with this product. If you have an upcoming event and you need a suit, I suggest ordering it 2 weeks before because it did take some time to get to me, but other then you will love it!!

I originally bought it for myself but it is too small for me so it went to my daughter. If you have a long torso, this probably isn't the suit for you. We are short-waisted so it was okay.  You definitely want to buy a size up as it runs small.  The medium will fit size 3-4 comfortably. The crochet lace is very soft and stretchy and it looks great on my daughter.  The bra is shaped cups with firm padding so if you are over blessed in the chest, that may or may not be an issue for you. Definitely worth the mention. It holds up well in the pool and the ocean.  I do think this has a trimming look to it, but when you are a size 3-4, do you really need to look more trim?  That being said,I think that lace design hides any imperfections on your tummy while still showing it off. Even if you aren't shapely, this suit helps gives that illusion so the size 3-4 (medium) is still worth the purchase. I'm probably going to buy one in my size now.

I knew from the other reviews that it was going to be clingy and you could tell that from the picture.  It hit exactly lengthwise on me as it does in the picture that they show.  The only thing that I'm not in love with is the lace for the cups.  I am a 38 C cup and I don't think it looks the greatest on the breasts.  If I put it how the one picture shows with only half the lace on them, it's okay but I'm not in love with it.  That is honestly the only negative thing I can say about it.  I love the silky feeling of the material and the length to me is perfect as it's not too long, but short enough to be flirtatious.\n\nI was able to achieve the result I was looking for as he was more than appreciative of the new addition to my wardrobe and he didn't seem to even notice the issue that I saw with the lace for the breasts.

So I've been purchasing a bunch & comparing how things feel & fit. I picked up this ELACUCOS Women's Sexy Lingerie Lace See-through Babydoll Nightwear Dress because it was a new pattern. I REALLY like the pinstripes, so I thought I'd give it a go.\n\nIt arrived quickly & upon opening it, I was impressed by the fabric & design. The chemise is well made, the stitching is complete & it looks great. Overall, it is lightweight, comfortable & flattering. The lace fits fairly well. I've noticed a lot of times, the lace will look crappy or be way too loose. That's not the case here, it's smooth & well cut. I would sleep in this one even if my boyfriend wasn't home because it just feels good against my skin! As for the G-string, it has the same material as the chemise. The style is the same as most of these outfits. There is a loop from the middle string that connects around the waistband. I gotta say that I don't really like that style as it tends to twist when I try to put them on or off. Regardless, I love the chemise with the pinstripes & the fabric, so I can wear just that to bed if I wanted.\n\nThe set fit me well & was very flattering.

The fit everywhere else is perfect though, so if I went up a size or two so it could fit up my arms, it would be way too big everywhere else. Also, you can't see it in the picture at all, but this is very thin and sheer (the white is anyway). It actually has a satin lining on the inside that gives it a strong lingerie-like feeling.

Its more of a blue splatter print which I don't really care for.  Also while the stitching is really strong it isn't exactly right.  The crisscross stich in the back design is off.  It doesn't line up with the middle of my back so the suit looks lopsided because there are 2 crisscross parts of the suit.  One is dead center but the bottom one is off center and its way off like over an inch off.  Because that is also the part that holds your bathing suit on under your armpit it pulls to one side making the width of the sections vastly off and you have to keep adjusting but it always reverts back cause its stitched wrong.  Also the fit isn't exactly as shown.  The neck doesn't come up as high as in the photo, the suit doesn't fit around your armpit as it does in the photo and the 2 straps at the neckline don't come together but are spaced about half an inch apart making the suit lay differently than showed.\n\n*I received this item at a discount of free in exchange for my honest opinion.

The idea is there, the execution isn't though.\n\nFirst off, the fabric.  It looks and feels like something you would expect out of a cheap Halloween costume or cheap lingerie.  I got black since I assumed it would have the least chance of being see-through.  Didn't work.  It's like the designer put together two layers of see-through, stiff chiffon and said okay that will work.  Not quite, sorry bud.  There are also loose seams EVERYWHERE and the straps look and feel incredibly flimsy.  Like one tug and it's done for.\n\nSecondly, the fit.  I love loose dresses.  I love off-the-shoulder tops.  Combine the two and I was super excited.  Unfortunately, the sleeves are made so small I don't think my six-year-old niece could wear them.  If I'd gone up in size they might have fit, but then it would look like I'm wearing a tent.\n\nI'm going to take a stab and say that I could probably sew something better than this.  Unless some serious design changes are made, I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this dress.  Unless you're looking for a nightie with really tight sleeves.\n\n***Please note that I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

I chose them because they looked a little different from your run of the mill cartoony kid goggles. My five year old son really enjoys them. And that is the primary reason they get the four stars. However, there are some cons. For one, the blue cast seen through the lenses does not do any favors as far as clarity goes. I would have preferred a lighter cast of polarized lens. The blue is a bit dark and my son had some trouble seeing clearly when first trying them on indoors. The part I disliked the most was the extra strap on the sides after adjusting to fit my son's head. These are supposed to be kid goggles but there just seemed to be so much excess strap that they stuck out in a somewhat dorky fashion on either side of my son's head. I know this is a problem for many kinds of goggles but I don't think the straps needed to be that long. What I really wish is that there were some way to secure them down so they wouldn't flop about but I think you only get that option with high end goggles. It doesn't pose a problem. It just doesn't look as cool that way.\n\nFor the price, the look and the solid quality so far, I am glad I got these goggles. They come with a good case and instructions for care as well so I am happy about the general packaging. They seem to put care into their product. So, four stars it is.\n\nThis product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. I strive to provide fellow shoppers with a thorough, sincere and informative review to help them make their final purchasing decision.

I purchased the black version hoping to have a versatile casual dress that I can wear with a blouse underneath or with leggings. I discovered that it has several problems wearing it all by itself or with layering:\n1) the material feels and looks like a man-made material that it is (polyester) which equals: cheap!!!\n2) the material shows anything underneath (lines, bulges, etc.)\n3) the fit under the hips is very wide - you can see it even on the pictures with the model. It just does not fit or hug your curves where it should\n4) it wrinkles and it has to be ironed which is kind of silly with polyester, and not at all handy when you travel\n5) the dress is too long to be worn with leggings\n\nHaving said all this, I didn't return it since the price I paid was so low. I hope to have it trimmed a bit and will have to opt for very thin blouse if I want to go for a layered look. Yeah, I am almost talking myself out of keeping it.", "summary": "I've upsized like the most reviewers recommended", "unixReviewTime": 1483401600}

I am in love with this beautiful A line dress.  This is one of those dresses that just makes you look good and  feel good when you  wear it. I ordered this dress in red.  The color is rich and vibrant.\n\nStyle:\nThe style of this dress is a classic A line sheath dress with a gentle scooping  neckline.  It has princess seams on the front and back, so it is fitted in the bust and waist.  The seam lines from the front curve just below the hip to meet the seams at the back.  That is a nice design detail.  The short sleeves are a nice length.  They fall just above the elbow.  Skirt length is just above the knee.  One of my favorite details of this dress is the long exposed metal zipper.  Not only is it functional, it creates interest to the back of the dress.\n\nYou always hear people say that you need to have a little black dress in your closet.  This is definitely the red equivalent.  This is certainly a wardrobe staple.\n\nThis is such a stylish dress.  It has a lot of design details that make it perfect for just about every occasion. This dress is perfect for work, school, social events, weddings and/or church.\n\nBecause the style is flattering but simple you can accessorize this dress in a million ways.  You can add a colorful scarf to the neck or shoulder.\nYou can add a belt at the midriff or waist.  It also looks beautiful with a blazer for a dressy business look.\n\nFabric and garment care:\nThe fabric of the dress is made of cotton/nylon blend.  It has a softness to it that only real cotton has.  There is a nice weight to the fabric.\nNo need for a slip under this dress, you can not see through it anywhere.  This dress can be machine washed in cold water on delicate cycle.  However, I think I may hand wash with woolite to preserve the color and shape of the dress.  Dry in the same manor as a sweater, laying flat on a towel.\n\nFit:\nThis fit of this dress is exactly what I expected.  I typically wear a 6 and it fit perfectly.  This dress hugs the curves in all the right places.  It makes your body look great but not like you are trying too hard.\n\nI am obsessed with this dress.  I have only had it two weeks and I have already worn it three times.  This is an important piece in my wardrobe.\nI will wear it for years to come.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/ANGVNS-Womens-Half-Sleeve-Seamed-A-Line-Dress-Wear-to-Work-Causal-Party-Dress-Red-M/dp/B01C7621UG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ANGVNS Womens Half Sleeve Seamed A-Line Dress Wear to Work Causal Party Dress Red M</a>\nSample provided for testing and reviewing.", "summary": "Beautiful dress that makes me feel good when I wear it", "unixReviewTime": 1458777600}

The material is nice and soft, HOWEVER the dress arrived so wrinkled, it was hard to imagine what it would look like without wrinkles.  I hung it in my closet for about two weeks to see if the wrinkles would relax; they did somewhat, but still not enough to give me confidence that this dress would be easy to take care of and keep it nice looking.  Additionally, the dress has these prominent lines down the front (you can't see them very well on the product's page); I think they're suppose to make you look skinnier (like the color-blocking trend), but I think they just look awkward (it looks like there are pockets, but alas, there aren't).  I think this dress looks too casual for work or cocktails or a wedding; I really don't know what I'd wear it to.", "summary": "The material is nice and soft", "unixReviewTime": 1460592000}

I particularly like her products because unlike most designers today her products are genuine leather and animal material.  I know a lot of people are against it, but if I am going to pay for it I want it to last and leather lasts.  She also is probably one of the most reasonably priced designers today.  I first saw this bag online and loved it from the moment I saw it.  I don't know why but it screams ranch at me and I love the rustic but also modern feeling of it.  When I recieved it, actually today, I fell in love with it all over again.  I love that it truely is a unique piece since mine has more foil on the front of the bag, which I assume it is hand applied or sprayed on so not every piece is going to look exactly like the photo.  I also love how soft it is, but I noticed after touching the front a few tiny flecks of the foil, I understand over time it may lose a little of it and give the piece even more character, but I will be extra careful with and make sure not to allow it to get wet. I also love that the strap can be removed because it is attached by snaps under the front flap.  Another positive it comes with a nice bag to store it in when I'm not using it and I can register it.\n\nNow I have to say why this didn't get 5 stars.  I first have to say if you are a person that likes a large purse, this is not the purse for you.  I love small purses because I hate carring a lot of stuff and a sm purse helps with that, but this is a small purse.  Now it may stretch a little since it is leather but it was a snug fit with my keys compact lighter and I had to change to a sm wallet with a coin purse on it and a seperat card holder for all my cards. This purse definately needs a small thin wallet.  It has a zipper pocket in the middle which could house money and change but I prefer a seperate wallet.  The only other thing about the bag I'm not thrilled with is that even though the strap can be removed, I can't make the strap a smaller size.  With a bag this small I like to have the option of making the strap into a wristlet size.  I tried wrapping the strap around a few times under the flap, but I noticed that it pulled on the front snap and I didn't want to stretch it.

I also ordered a Karen Scott sweater, just a little different style but basically the same sweater, from Macy's and it came folded like you would fold a sweater before placing in a dresser drawer, and it came  in a clear plastic bag within the plastic mailer which was nice as it was also raining that day when I received it and no drips got on the sweater.  But who wants more plastic, clear or whatever in the dumps, so I don't care if Amazon uses a clear one inside the package or not really.  I just wanted to give you some feedback.\nThank you\nCarolyn", "summary": "Love Karen Scott Sweaters", "unixReviewTime": 1454371200}

It's a great dress so I don't mind too much nor did I return it. It's a double layer dress, the outside being sheer. The sheer part extends to the sleeves which are gathered at the wrists and split from the shoulder like the female bad guy in Superman 3 (?) super sexy and so flattering!! The dress is an A-line falling above the knee. I'm always wary of buying clothes online, especially from overseas, but I got a great deal on this from an Amazon affiliate in exchange for this review, so it was worth it to take the chance. Hey, it can always be returned, right?! I debated doing so when I saw it was a double, but decided to keep it in case my other one got ruined somehow. So that should testify for the design and quality level. It drives me crazy when people write reviews saying a size small \"fit great\" or was \"a bit small\" but the reader has no idea what that means!! So I'm 5'8.5 and about 138lbs. The dress hem falls just above my knees. Happy hunting and I hope this helps!! If so, please Lmk below!!", "summary": "My favorite dress!

I settled on these Scrunchies since they came in a pack of all black and they looked like regular Scrunchies. I started using them in June of 2016, and now own 15 Scrunchies (three packs).\n\nMy first impression of these Scrunchies was very good. They did not have a factory odor, chemical smell, plastic smell, or rubber smell. They were a true \"dark black\" color and did not look faded or worn out. They were also 100% cotton, one of my primary reasons for ordering them.\n\nThe first annoyance I had with these Scrunchies was the tags on each Scrunchy. The tags are big, white, and sewn into the Scrunchy in a way that if you cut the tag out you can screw up the seam on the Scrunchy and it will fall apart and be useless. This occurred with two Scrunchies before I learned to just get used to the tags and try to tuck them in. Still, I don't think individual tags are necessary and they are cleverly not shown on the Amazon photographs.\n\nI use these Scrunchies in my thick, shoulder length hair which is almost always in a ponytail unless I'm sleeping. I shower with a Scrunchy in place, remove it to wash my hair, and put it right back in before I put my hair towel on. Wet Scrunchies have to be hung on  a doorknob or placed on a flat surface to dry overnight or they will smell like mildew in the morning.\n\nWhen these Scrunchies get wet they shed. When I say shed, I don't mean a small little fuzzy piece here or there, I mean black fuzzy pieces everywhere...in my hair, on the floor of the shower, on my t-shirts, and on the towels. If you wash them prior to the first use, they shed less the first time you get them wet, but they still do shed on a regular basis, even after dozens of washings.\n\nLike all Scrunchies, these start to lose their shape over time. 6 of the Scrunchies I own are so bent out of shape that they no longer stay tight in my hair. Photos show them hanging on a door knob so you can see the difference in length when they get bent out of shape as well as them side by side on the counter. The far left Scrunchy is the newest, the middle Scrunchy is one year old, and the end Scrunchy is one completely bent out of shape.\n\nI've tried many brands of Scrunchies that are 100% cotton, including some that are handmade, and yet the only ones I've stuck with are the Cottonique brand Scrunchies because they look and feel like normal Scrunchies and hold your hair tightly in place.", "summary": "Great Scrunchies for people with allergies to plastic, rubber, or inorganic materials.

She received numerous compliments and was one of a kind.\nThe representative answered all the questions very quickly when we sent them out.

I was given an expected delivery date of late April, but they ended up coming almost a month earlier.  Pleasant surprise.  I purchased the bright lime color and it is so cute.  I purchased for my baby boy, but could totally be worn by a girl as well.  The stitching isn't the world's best craftsmanship, but for the price, this is an excellent value.  They are sturdy and are staying on my baby's feet, even though they are slightly large on him right now.  I'm glad that he will be able to wear them for a few months still.  They have plastic grips on the bottom outside sole for traction, so if my baby does start to take some steps sometime soon, I feel comfortable that he won't slip.  Very cute and preppy shoe!

Harper", "reviewText": "I bought this dress for my oldest daughter to wear in my upcoming wedding. One thing I need to mention, the color says \"hunter green\", but it looks to be aqua (my main color is Tiffany blue) in the above picture. However, upon arrival, we compared this color to the other gowns I had purchased and this is actually more of a mint green. I felt I needed to mention that so if you are looking for an aqua colored gown, this is not aqua but more mint. While I was hoping it was more aqua, I will not be returning it because it is beautiful and it was a custom-made piece. I will just deal with the color difference. That's the least of my worries at this point for my wedding. Lol\n\nThe gown itself is very well made and beautiful. My daughter loves it and it fits her beautifully. After purchasing it, I received an email from the maker asking for my daughter's measurements, which I promptly sent. While the gown fits her very well, the bust is a bit big, even though I sent her exact measurements. I may have to get it taken in a bit, but that's okay.\n\nThe communication was excellent and they were quick to answer all my emails in a timely manner. I bought this gown on a Saturday afternoon and we were given an estimated delivery date of the first week of June. However, the dress arrived less than 2 weeks AFTER ordering it. Talk about fast! And this was for a customized gown!\n\nThis purchase was definitely a bargain considering how fast it came and how beautiful it is. The dress is not a lightweight dress, but it's not heavy like a bridal gown either. It does have a bit of a train, meaning it's longer in the back. It's a very pretty, flowing gown and my daughter is one very happy gal.", "summary": "A beautiful bargain!", "unixReviewTime": 1463875200}

Because of the work I do I can not wear a regular watch because I am always getting it hung up on things. This allows me to simply put the watch in my pocket without worrying about getting hurt while I am working. I Really Love the Design of this pocket watch, it reminds me of my granddads old pocket watch he carried with him everywhere he went. It has Quartz movements that keeps perfect time. The dial of the watch is white with roman numerals, the case is made out of a black alloy that also has roman numerals around the outside of the case. It comes complete with a carrying chain which makes is Very Easy to remove from your pocket and also keeps you from losing your watch if it would happen to fall out of your pocket. I was Really impressed with the Quality of their pocket watch and am Amazed at the Very Affordable price. If you like pocket watches and the look of yesterday this is a Excellent Choice for a Affordable pocket watch that keeps Perfect time. I would Very Highly Recommend the Mudder Antique Style Black Quartz pocket Watch to everyone that wants a High Quality Pocket Watch with the Antique Look.

Hes a big wolverine fan but also reserved in character. Hes also a football coach and doesnt do flashy so I wasn't sure if he would like this. I took a chance anyway and Im glad I did. He was surprised by it and liked it. He immediately switched out his old one for this one. There aren't as many card slots as his old one but he made it work by eliminating some cards he no longer needed. There is a small zippered pocket inside  with 2 card slots that can hold 3 cards and a side \"pocket\" behind the slots.\nThe colors look exactly as pictured.

I spend more time fishing into my wallet than I do waiting in line to pay for things.\n\nThe worst: It's been two weeks since I bought this and it's already tearing at the seams.
