I was a little hesitant to purchase because the size range is so large but it fits my 21 pound 27\" long baby just fine, with a little room to spare.\n\nI was surprised at how warm and soft it is but the black on the material does shed a little bit, which is a bit of an issue.  The tiny fibers can end up in baby's mouth but are way too small to cause any kind of choking hazard.  I would recommend washing the outfit first before wearing.  If the fibers bother you, don't purchase.  It should also be noted that this outfit does not come with white socks.\n\nFor the price at this time of this review ($14, shipped in two days with prime) I find it to be a bargain.  If you're thinking about this as a Halloween outfit you should definitely buy a few weeks in advance.  It'll give you enough time to test it out first and make sure it fits so you have enough time to buy another one if it doesn't.", "summary": "Super soft, warm, and comfortable for baby!

I was worried that they might be a little short (I'm 5'8\") but the length was actually perfect! The material quality and construction are excellent. The cloth is thick, slightly shiny like in the picture, sturdy, and has a nice soft lining. These feel more like high-quality jeans than leggings - they do stretch, but not anywhere near as much as most leggings. Highly recommend checking the size chart in the description before ordering. Go by their measurements and you'll get an accurate fit. Colors are stunning and don't turn white when stretched. Also, there are front and back pockets! They're a useful size but don't protrude and mess up the silhouette. I'm going to be keeping an eye on this brand...", "summary": "Beautiful, high quality.", "unixReviewTime": 1471996800}

It seems like a grayish tan, too me.\n\nI checked the knit, and the seams and they appear to be well done. The knit is very elastic and returns to its previous shape when stretched.

Then, I put on a comfy black sleep cap first for extra warmth in the sub-zero temperatures and donned my new hat.  (This method also helped to secure this rather large hat.)  I was very pleased how nicely it went with my mostly gunmetal winter coat until, at the end of the day, there were several \"eyelashes\" stuck to my nice coat.  It got worse and worse the more I wore it and now I call the \"eyelashes\" CHICKEN FEATHERS because it reminds me of an old down-filled pillow that sheds like mad and needs new ticking! It's driving me crazy...all over my black silk turtleneck, my black pants, the floor, the furniture...even on my cat! They float happily in the air and I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD KEEP A LINT ROLLER & A CAR VAC ON MY PERSON AT ALL TIMES.  It truly is laughable that these \"eyelashes\" are just slipped under a single strand of yarn and not secured in any way. It's a very darling hat  and the ample pompom is lovely too.  I'm wondering if even washing it in a mesh bag on the delicate setting and air-drying it (with maybe a minute in a cool dryer to puff up the pompom afterwards) will help secure these chicken feathers, but I'm not betting on it. I'll bet instead that this hat will lose all its eyelashes before winter ends! Already, it's looking pretty pathetic and I'm tempted to remove all the yarn bits by hand because so many of them are HALF falling out, which IS totally tacky-looking....Just don't be like me and take the label off so you can return it if you choose to buy this item. [Actually, I think I did Funky Junque a favor by not advertising a poorly-conceived AND VERY poorly-executed product!]", "summary": "CHICKEN FEATHERS!!!.....", "unixReviewTime": 1453939200}

They are made short and wide!**Superior quality materials though!!**\n\nAside from the fit, this is just the most perfect blanket-soft romper. And, so adorable! My baby liked wearing it. It kept her very warm and cozy on our sail boat on a cold windy day. My 3 year old son enjoyed seeing the monkey on her too.\n\n My baby is 10 months old and has a long torso and average legs. We got the 12 month size and noticed right away that it was short and wide, much like other rompers I have purchased from a company in China. The hood was a nice fit around her head, but it didn't reach up high enough. It was just riding up in the rear a bit and I could just barely get the suit comfortably around her shoulders and buttoned up all the way. The bottom hem was just the right length for her to stand (and walk if she could) It won't fit her much longer, but it would have been great for her a few months ago. I don't mind the width of the suit at all, it just looks really cute and cozy with the extra material on the side.\n\nI have 3 kids, and I have never come across a romper that is so luxuriously soft, thick, high quality! (And I've had a lot of cozy fuzzy rompers) You only see things this soft in an actually baby blanket! It's boutique quality - lined with very nice soft cotton, so your baby won't sweat and be uncomfortable. And if it's really cold out, you can flip the whole thing inside out. It's completely reversible, so your baby can experience that soft fuzzy material on the skin. I love that feature!\n\nThe snaps are unlike any snaps I've ever seen on clothing. They are way way better than the basic metal snaps you see on most US brands. These snaps are plastic and are very strong and durable. They won't be cold on baby's skin and they are just overall way better than the metal kind.\n\nI do not dare put this in the dryer because I want the blanketed material to stay super soft. Sometimes drying blankets can lessen the softness and cause a worn out, fuzzy look. *Machine wash cold and hang dry.*", "summary": "**Order a size up if your little one has a long torso.

Upon opening the box, you will be greeted by a smell not unlike a spring lawn (grassy/muddy). Other reviewers used polish to reduce the scent, but I'm guessing it will also wear off over time. The belt has a high quality feel to it, and I find the crocodile pattern on it quite attractive. It looks just like the picture.

The belt arrived in brand new condition and was extremely well packaged. The belt did arrive a little late and the shipping time was quite long. Once I received the box I realized that this is because it is coming directly from China.\n\nQuality:\nThe belt itself appears to be very high quality. I really like the subtle pattern on the leather, and overall was impressed with the feel and appearance of this belt for the price. It appears that it will stand up very well to wear and tear based on the craftsmanship.\n\nSize:\nThe length of the belt was perfect for me and the size I ordered. Note that this belt is a thin style. I have included a reference quarter in the pictures to help illustrate the thickness and size.\n\nSmell:\nThe only downside to this belt (and the reason for the 4 star rating) is the smell. When I opened the box a sweet grassy smell was coming out of the box. I think that this may have something to do with the length of shipping time and the fact that a deodorizer was not included in the package, but I can't wear this out in public until the product airs out. I used some leather cleaner to help reduce the smell which seemed to help a lot.\n\nOverall Summary:\nIf you are looking for a high quality belt at a very reasonable price and you don't mind waiting a bit longer for shipping than this belt is a great choice. I would also allow a couple of days for the belt to air out before use. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

My review is unbiased and based on the product's performance as sold on Amazon. This is the third Buyreal belt I've ordered for my hubby. He loved the first two, so I decided to check out another style and color. He is picky and hates cheap belts that start pulling apart at the holes after a few months. Like most men, he rotates wearing the same couple of belts every single day until they start to show wear and then he sends me shopping for a new one. He only likes 1 out of 10 belts I bring home, so it was a big deal that he liked the first Buyreal belt I brought home. This belt comes in a nice tin box appropriate for gift giving. The belt is rolled inside with tissue paper. This style has a modern feel, with a nice, rich, real leather matte finish. No shiny plastic look to the leather. The buckle is a silver that doesn't look or feel cheap. The sizing is right one, so if you fluctuate order one size larger. The interior has a nice finish and is stamped that it is real leather. The leather band is a nice width and thickness. I expect it to last many years. The original belt I received from Amazon had a dented tin and the belt had a dark stain near the front, which hubby wasn't happy about. I contacted the seller and they were very responsive. They immediately arranged for me to exchange the original belt. The replacement had no problems. I was barely able to take a picture before hubby grabbed it out of my hands. The Tan color is very rich looking...I'm trying to think of the right color to describe it. Sort of a burnt sienna color, not tan, not rust. Very RL country estate color.

It is a little to wide for me personally to wear with dress slacks as I prefer a thinner width belt for that.

(meaning the belt seems to run on the smaller side) Where as with other 44 belts in my collection I can use the second or third. While it fits fine now, it would not fit me any more if I was to gain any weight in the waist.

There.! .... I said it.!!!\nHaving said that, this belt has gone a long way toward changing my mind. I REALLY like the idea. One nice belt to mix and match with two different colors. It's hard to imagine a better idea. The problem has always been the belt never lives up to the expectation.!!  In this case however, it comes close, REALLY close.!!\n\nThis belt is the traditional black/brown with a buckle that pivots to allow the choice. PERFECT.!!  Well, yeah... mostly. Problems always seem to occur when the belt has been used for a few weeks and the buckle loosens up on the pivot, or it loosens up on the belt. This one seems to have solved (maybe..??) those issues.\n\nI have been on a quest for a belt for several months. I have purchased several (MANY..!!) and am still looking. I now own at least a dozen and none of them are perfect. A couple are close.... the rest are mediocre or poor, depending on how you look at things. This belt is one of the better ones. It's not perfect, but then...??  I like the color saturation on both sides. The buckle appears to be nicely done and seems to be well mounted. I managed to order and get the right size (lucky, I guess..) and it arrived in good shape.\n\nWhat makes this belt better than most is the performance. It just seems to work. the leather is nicely finished and the color on both sides is deep and uniform. The buckle pivots cleanly and snaps into position like it should. Overall, it's just a nicely done belt.\n\nProblems... Well, there really aren't any. At least right now. I am not particularly enamored with the thickness of the belt (it seems thin..??). The anchors that hold the buckle are tiny and questionable. And the belt seems to take a \"set\" quickly. All of this is not new to those among us who wear belts (especially leather belts..). So, I can't really say that I dislike anything...... so far.\n\nI am giving this belt four stars for its initial performance and looks. If it continues in the same way, I will be very pleased indeed.!!  If not, I will come back here and update the review.  For now, four stars for a nice belt and a good value.\n*Product furnished for review. This is it. My evaluation. My words. Enough said.", "summary": "NICE belt...

The different lens come in quite handy depending on the time of day you use the glasses, and the glasses are very lightweight which is really important for people who use them for undertaking long exercises. The price is also fairly reasonable for everything that you receive.\n\n I use these glasses frequently for cycling, running, and even just to wear around outside the house to shield my eyes from the sun. I wear these glasses outside often and worry very little about harmful rays ruining my eyes; the glasses allow just enough sun through the lenses and keep the rest out. The set also comes with a really nice hard case that allows you to take them on trips without fear of breaking, and also comes with a cloth case that makes travel lighter and more compact. The glasses are also unisex so both men and women can wear them and they look stylish and comfortable.\n\nAs an overview, these glasses are a very nice product for the price that you pay. Im a long distance cyclist and enjoy wearing them with every ride, but runners or any outdoorsy people would have luck with these glasses.\n\nDisclaimer: I received this item at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.

The frame itself is a bit flimsy, which makes changing lenses a bit difficult, and when taking them on/off, the flex in the frame doesn't allow you to easily put them on one-handed.  The adjustable nose piece is ok, but is almost too easy to adjust and occasionally gets knocked out of place.\n\nFor my face, they don't cover my full peripheral vision, and they tend to sit a bit too far away from my checkbones to have what I consider a perfect fit.  Otherwise, they are comfortable and stay put, with the rubber nose piece and the rubber on the arms providing decent grip.  If you want just a cheap pair of sunglasses with the flexibility of the various lenses and a nice case, these are worth looking into.  By all means they aren't \"designer\" quality, but they're as good as any other $20 sunglasses I've purchased and you do get a lot for your money.\n\nIf style and perfect fit is absolutely the highest priority, you probably won't like these, but if that's you, then you probably shouldn't be buying a no-name brand online and hoping they fit perfectly.  Of course, everyone's face is different so they might fit you better than me.\n\nI received this product free or nearly free in order to evaluate and provide my opinion.

First, it is reversible between two nice colors (black and dark brown), that are very appropriate for formal attires. Second, it is really soft and flexible and has a nice texture. Third, the buckle is impressive; you do not need to open it in order to reverse the belt. You just need to rotate the outer part of the buckle around itself. Finally, the sizing of this belt is accurate. I have ordered a size that is 2 inches more than my pants size, which is the standard rule for determining the belt size. The belt fits very well. Here is my complete feedback for this belt.\n\nFeedback\n-------------\n Length and Fit. The waist size of my pants is 38 inches and according to the general rule, I ordered the size 40 of this belt. It fits me very well and I still have empty holes at each side so I can have it tighter or relaxed without the need for extra holes.\nLook and design. I like the two colors of this belt (black and brown) since they are suitable for formal attire, which I normally wear. The belt has a nice texture on both sides. Reversing the buckle cannot be simper, no special tools are needed. You just need to rotate the buckle around itself.\nIMPORTANT: you need to pull the outer part of the buckle outside first then rotate. It will not rotate without pulling it out.\n Quality. The leather looks well-made and it is soft and comfortable. The two layers are stitched on the sides, which is thoughtful. In some reversible belts, the two layers are just glued together, which may be sufficient if they are professionally made, but having the stitch definitely make the belt durable. My previous stitched belt survived for almost 5 years.\n\nSummary\n-------------\nOverall, I am happy with this belt. It fits very well and it has a very good quality as far as I can tell. It would be nice if the punched holes are enforced with some kind of metal or rigid material so that they will not deform or stretch out overtime.\n\nI received this product at a discount in exchange for testing and review.", "summary": "High quality leather, nice texture, and fits as expected", "unixReviewTime": 1459209600}

The belt is attractively packaged and would be fully ready to go as a gift.  An initial thought on the belt was that is was so light and soft.  It made me question its strength and ability.  My husband absolutely loves it.  He goes through a new belt every few months, and so far in the past two weeks, there is no sign of wear.  The belts we buy at chain stores with name brands, are thick and sturdy.  That also means, that it shows wear pretty quickly wear the loops are used and bent each time to put it on.  There is no sign of color wear either because there aren't indentations where it has been used. This is a reversible black/brown in attractive shades.  I know that sounds odd, but sometimes the brown isn't really a true brown.  It is real leather and there is a reversible pin buckle to allow it to reverse.  You can cut it down to a smaller size if needed, so it may help to buy a larger size.  My husband absolutely loves this belt.  It is a bonus to find it be light, easy to pack for trips, and reversible in a real leather.  I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.

A word about sizing, since some of the other reviews had me confused. It fits true to size, but you need to remember that the top is SUPPOSED to be snug-fitting like a thermal top. If your child has a huskier build, then you may want to go up a size, but in that case then the pants might be too long.\n\nIf your child is between sizes or you're debating between two sizes then I recommend going for the larger size just to be safe, but I wouldn't go purposely a size up purely to compensate for what people are saying. I did that and now my older has to wear the PJ's I had intended for my younger son!\n\nI'd sum it up by saying this style suits average or slender builds. My sons are tall and slender and this fits just great. If my child was husky though I would probably go with a totally different style of PJ since then the top would be too snug or the pants too long, depending on what size you go for.\n\nOne other item of note: the elastic waist is not too tight or too loose on my sons, an important factor for comfort. The style and feel of these PJ's was very popular with my son. These are great PJ's for pajama parties or pajama day at school - comfy, trendy original designs that don't look exactly like what every other kid has already.", "summary": "Great PJ's, good for average or slender builds.", "unixReviewTime": 1456358400}

I absolutely love that I can get adult pants with such a cute dinosaur print. They are also very soft and cozy and warm, and at $11.99 they were a good price. What I don't like about them is the fit. The hip/stomach/crotch area is very large with a lot of extra fabric. If I pull them up to my belly button, the crotch still hangs way low. I guess I shouldn't mind because they are pajama pants so it's not like it matters if they fit perfectly, but it's weird. I almost thought they were too big, but if I got a smaller size I think the rest of the pants would be smaller than I like. The total length of the pants is right for me now.

I'm still rating this a 4 though because the necklace being the main piece is nicely made.. Just not worth the $50 as a gift packaging and incorrect charms.", "summary": "just in time for Mother's Day and I'm slightly disappointed in my purchase", "unixReviewTime": 1462492800}

This necklace comes with a cute card that can be used to write in, and it is so well package that it is ready to gift as soon as receiving it. This necklace has a 22 inch long chain and the lock itself measures 30 millimeters which is perfect length for my mom to wear. These floating charms stay inside of the locket and the lock it is easy to open and has a magnet on one side that closes with a magnetic seal. Each  locket comes with the gems already in it and the other decorative items that are shown in the picture but you could absolutely change them out if you wanted to put something else in it. I like the colors of the jewels that come with it, but I might look for the birthstone gems of each of her grandchildren. It would be fun to add birthstone gems of each of her kids as well. The locket itself is stainless steel and it has a roller ball chain that I think will last a long time. The best thing about having you as my mom is my kids having you as a grandma, is the coolest saying that I have seen for a Mother's Day gift! And this necklace and the card both have that saying on it. This is definitely a fashionable necklace that you could spend lots and lots and lots for elsewhere, but it is a perfect quality and perfect gift purchase right here on Amazon. I did get a discount on this item in exchange for my honest and unbiased review which I have provided for you here today.

We found a lady who made them online, but the price was around $75 for each swimsuit I gave up on the idea that I would get the look I wanted at an affordable price, that is, until I found this swimsuit on Amazon. First, let me say, I love the quality and the stretchy material. I feel that it hides those flaws that I don't want showing when at the beach or pool. I felt that the sizing was described perfectly and the swimsuit came in at the size I anticipated.\n\nI love the color. The suit is very well made. The breast pads are thick and full bra like cup is sewn in to give that busty look. The front of the suit is fully lined as well. The stitching appears to be reinforced and looks like it will be strong and sturdy and withstand years of use.\nThe suit itself is labeld as being made in China and shipped to the US, which gives me great confidence in the seller of the product for nailing sizing specifications. I have found in the past when purchasing clothing made in China, the sizing is usually off so KUDOS to the seller for getting that straightened out.\n\nThough the label isn't 100% in English, it appears the suit is 82% polyester and 18% spandex. It states \"Elasthan\" as the spandex material, so perhaps this is some other type of material I am not familiar with.\n\nThe straps seem to be very well attached to the suit, which is really important in the quality of the suit. Some of the suits I have purchased from quality retailers and mass merchandisers have left a lot to be desired when it comes to strap,so I found the straps attachment to be firmly secured and well made.\n\nOverall I think the suit is a great deal for the look I wanted!\n\nI received this suit at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review of the product.", "summary": "Great Swimsuit at an affordable price!", "unixReviewTime": 1463184000}

I ordered the coat for my 10 year old grandaughter who weighs about 120 pounds and is about 5 foot 1 inch tall and wears a women's MEDIUM. I bought an EXTRA LARGE.  All that that being said, it fits her PERFECTLY wearing winter clothes under it.\nThe coat is very soft inside and out, VERY WARM and nicely made.  The COAT IS NOT WATERPROOF.  The outside feels almost like a micro fiber blanket; the inside lining of the body of the coat is kind of a cross between a blanket and fake fur. It does not shed on clothes though.  The insides of the sleeves are lined with a cotton material.  Down fill is sandwiched in between all\nThe coat has a full length zipper as well as snaps over the zipper and also has an enclosed tie that runs around the middle so the waist can be snugged up if necessary.\nThe hood is generous and lined with the same blanket/fur material as the body of the coat. The fake fur around the hood is not especially soft, but it is not awful either and does not seem to be shedding; I think it looks very cute.\nThe coat comes almost to my grandaughter's knees, which is very good in my opinion as it keeps much more of her body warm.  But as I said, she is only about 5' 1\", so if you are taller, the coat will be shorter as it is in the advertisement picture.\nI ordered it in pink but it is slightly on the salmon side.  I find that much prettier than the baby pink shown in the picture.\nI had been looking at several coats and vascillating over the size I wanted.  I accidentally ordered a large when I really had meant to order an XL (knowing it came from China).  I contacted the company by email before it shipped and asked if they could send the XL instead of the L.  The company responded by email within 30 minutes and immediately pulled the large and replaced with the XL and shipped it out the same day. They were very nice about it.\nI paid $39.99 for it with free shipping. It had gone up to $41.99 by the time I received it, and now I see the price has gone up to $44.99.  I feel it was worth the $39.99 I paid for it.  I certainly would NOT pay more than $45.00 for this coat (and only if the shipping remains free)\nI ordered it on November 11, 2015 and received it on November 27, 2015, so 16 days from China; not too bad.\nMy Grandaughter is HARD on her clothes so she managed to rip the right pocket about 4 inches because she forever has her hands in it and tugs.  I reparied it easily with a couple of hand stitches and I reinforced the left pocket at the corner against future issues.  (Normal people probably would NOT have to take this step!)\nShe has had it 3 weeks now and has worn it to school every day.  I am just about to give it it's first wash and will re-review if the coat has issues.  The washing instructions are to \"HAND WASH\"  I will try to upload a picture of her wearing it.\nSo far,  I REALLY like this coat and I will buy another when the price comes back down.\n6/27/2016\nI meant to update this sooner.  Granddaughter got this filthy on the playground - more than once..  I sprayed all the extra dirty parts with pre wash (I use a mixture of 1 bottle of hydrogen peroxide and about 2 teaspoons of dawn dish soap in a spray bottle for all my pre wash...works great).\nAnyway, sprayed it. Let it set a couple of hours to overnight. Put it in the washing machine on warm and casual cycle/long wash, double rinsed it, hung it up on a sturdy hanger and hung it outside to dry.  When dry, I brushed the fur around the hood with a hairbrush to fluff it up again.  Boom, done.  Came out great.  I have since washed it at least 8 times.  Still fine.\nWARNING>  THE MANUFACTURER RECOMMENDS HAND WASH.  (But I still don't; I have no time or back for that).", "summary": "REALLY GOOD and WARM COAT", "unixReviewTime": 1449705600}

It definitely looks much better in person. You can tell that this purse is made from real leather. The brown leather is textured and super soft. The purse has some adorable gold hardware which make this purse unique.\n\nThe overall size of this purse is approximately 16 L x 10 H X 5 W. The base of the purse is almost 13.5 inches but I based the length on the widest part. The sides of the purse is kind of scrunched together with a buckle so the bottom extends out a little more. The top of the buckle has a gold d-ring where the included strap can be attached. Theres an adjustable strap that you can use with this purse to turn it into a shoulder bag. The strap adjusts by a gold buckle and the strap has 5 holes.\n\nI actually prefer just using the handles. There are two padded handles that are attached by gold metal links. I really love the unique design of the gold metal swivels where the handles attach to the purse. It pinches the leather together and gives it a more dimensional appearance. The swivels allow the handles to drop properly in place.\n\nThe top of the purse features a gold zipper with a large gold pull. Inside the purse is chocolate brown. The lining has a water repellent material so its really easy to wipe clean. The backside has a 6.5 zipper pocket. In front of this zipper pocket is an 8.5 pouch with a zipper pocket. The other side has an 8 side pocket. Theres a 4 hard flat bottom. Theres plenty of room in this purse to fit almost anything that you need. You can even slide your tablet in along with your wallet and makeup bag. The side pouch is great for things like my calendar book and phone so I can quickly find it when needed.\n\nThe back of the purse features a 7 zipper pocket. It has a gold zipper with a large gold pull. It has the same lining as the inside of the purse. The pocket is about 4.5 tall. I like to use this pocket for shopping receipts or other personal notes.\n\nI received a nice dust bag with my purse. This is great to help keep it clean when storing. I absolutely love this purse. The leather is very nice and the colors are gorgeous. This unique looking purse is perfect for me. I highly recommend this Yahoho leather purse. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Fashionable & Very Soft Leather Handbag with Lots of Storage Inside", "unixReviewTime": 1449619200}

It has no defects. It runs a little smaller than I expected it to but it still fits. The buckle is high quality and it doesn't seem like the holes will rip like a cheaper belt. It seems very durable and well made. I've certainly paid more for belts in a department store that broke from being worn tightly daily. The stitching is well done and has no stray threads that I could find. The buckle feels substantial and the leather is thick. Hard to believe the claim it's real leather at that price but it seems to be with how it's holding up. Claims it's reversible but its not! Well it is but the buckle isn't which is dumb and uncomfortable. I love the pattern on it. If that buckle would just swivel around it would be awesome!

It happens! But never have I been so disappointed in a seller or their product that I have felt like giving them a ZERO. These are the reasons why I would not recommend them or their product.\n\nIt took nearly a month to get these bras. After waiting such a long time, you hope to get exactly what they describe on their page. Not even close!\n\n1. These are advertised as Genie bras. I sincerely doubt that these are genuine Genie bras. There is absolutely nothing to identify these as being name brand Genie bras. They arrived in clear cellophane bags -- no box or package that says Genie. The inside writing on the bra does not say Genie. I have purchase several Genie bras, they all were stamped Genie inside the bra. These just have irregular stamping with size and fabric content. I think they are cheap knockoffs. You will notice in several of the reviews for this same seller with different colored bras (beige, etc.) reviewers remark that these bras were not the same quality, size, or colors of their previous Genie bras. Probably because they are not genuine Genie bras as advertised.\n2. The colors were a far cry from what is shown and described on the page. The only color that even came close was the turquoise. The red turned out to be traffic-cone orange and the purple was not light purple but a dark, shiny purple. Not the colors I wanted.\n3. You would think they could at least get the size right. No! I ordered medium and was sent small. Other reviewers have complained about the sizing, some saying they were too tight. What I got was loose fitting, so I can't imagine what they would have fit like if they had actually sent the mediums I ordered. My other Genie bras are all medium and fit great.\n4. When I tried them on, the band just rolled up. The padding inside the cups was cut too large for the actual cup size, so the padding curled out on the bottom creating a giant ridge -- just what you want for a smooth look under clothing, padding curled and sticking straight out.\n5. Even with all of this, I was open to trying to resolve it with the seller, I contacted them via e-mail (through Amazon) with a request for return. I never heard from them.\n\nThis is why I would give Amazon Customer Service FIVE stars! I didn't have to do anything or hassle with them. After a week went by (since my e-mail to seller), they automatically e-mailed me to find out if I had heard back from the seller. When I told them no, I was e-mailed easy instructions on how to file a claim to get a refund. They attempted to contact the seller again to try to resolve the issue to no avail. Amazon gave me a refund and I really appreciated it. They took the time to make sure that I as a customer was satisfied and they made good on a transaction with a poor seller even though it was not their fault.

I love these pants so much that I want one in every style and color! My only disappointment is the length. Since my legs and abdomen are short I actually had to cut a couple inches off the bottom, but I didn't need to sew it because the material doesn't shred. It was a nice clean cut. The seams were off slightly so the circles on my legs don't match up; someone must not have been paying attention to what they were doing the day they sewed these, but it's not that noticeable. Those are my only concerns. Otherwise, they are SUPER comfortable and fit me in the waist very well. Thank you!", "summary": "Length a little long for me personally", "unixReviewTime": 1471737600}

I am tiny 32 breast, short just barely under 5'4. My weight is 112.  I did feel this fit in some ways almost perfect.  My issue is the shoulder area it was snug. I do have broad shoulders (for as small as I am) so this wasn't too shocking but- I did want a loose fit as described. The small does fit but not the way I want it too.  I actually ordered another in a size 6.  I normally wear a 2-4.  I am considered petite being under 5'5.  The dress in a size 4 came to about my bottom calf-top of ankle or high ankle. The 6 is only a couple inches larger and where the 4 was loose enough in breast and everywhere else it wasn't loose enough for my taste( or my shoulders)  I did not return the size 4.  I may keep it as it does fit or I might use it as a gift for my niece who is half my age but a size 2.  I am between a 2-4 depending on what the clothing is.  I could wear a 4, 6 or 8 in this dress--  It depends on your personal preference I would say.  The yellow color is an odd color it is not bright yellow like a cab but has a slight hue of very light olive in it, I would call it a yellow drab; not a yellow cab.  it is a cool color, I will admit -odd but cool.. The buttons are fake, you cannot undo them. They are for looks. fyi. The entire dress is double layered with the exception of the sleeves. They can be buttoned or rolled up. I hope my review helps someone. I spent hours trying on different sizes because I could since I ordered my mother one.  I am somewhere in the middle opinion-wise and say the size will be personal preference.  if you are tiny and have broad shoulders I recommend going up in size so that you have some extra stretch room  in the shoulders..

Ive been branching out of my comfort zone and trying to wear clothes that are a little more risqu than what I typically wear..just because Im a mom doesnt mean I need to dress like one and this shirt is fantastic.\n\nSo from the front, this is a pretty cute, modest looking shirt.  The lace is a sweet touch.and then you turn around and Bam!  Now, if you're like me and you aren't quite comfortable with the backless look yet, you can stick a cute complementary colored tank top underneath the shirt (teal looks amazing with the navy blue.)  Im personally excited to wear this come summer.  I have to wear a suit jacket regardless of the weather and it can get so hot in the summer that this shirt is perfect.  It looks perfectly nice and professional with my jacket on and no one will be any the wiser about the back of the shirt.  This is a shirt thats really versatile and you can really dress it up or dress it down.  It looks amazing paired with my professional suit and with a cute pair of jeans and boots.\n\nI ordered the size 14, which is my size, and its a little tightbut I also lean a little towards size 16 on tops because I have a larger bust.  I would say its pretty true to size, but if you prefer your shirts looser, order a size up. The quality is fantastic and I would certainly purchase this shirt again.\n\nI received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.", "summary": "Super soft shirt that's a little risque and fun!", "unixReviewTime": 1454198400}

This company's customer service is 5 star. Customer service seems to becoming a dwindling priority but this company shines. The shirt is made from soft, durable cotton. Because it is cotton it does have minor shrinkage, but at its first wash the shirt becomes softer. The color hasn't faded as yet. The collar is almost like a modified boatneck design. In my opinion the construction of the shirt is well made. Because this shirt is foreign made, the sizes are different from the US. It tends to be at  one size smaller than you buy here. Plus, it is cotton and allow for some shrinkage. We washed ours in cold water, and put it in the dryer. You have to decide what you like in a fit. If you like the big, oversized look it would a good idea to go big size. For example, if you are in a mens large and you want it to fit as a large go for an XL. It will shrink to your desired look, but be conservative of your laundry habits at first. For my family, the bigger the better, so I ordered 3XL's. When in doubt go larger.  Shipping time is a bit long, that is because it is not shipped from the US. Well worth the wait.

The crown protector is the correct size and thickness and has the release towards the 12 o'clock, that most other watches in this price range seem to reverse.\n\nThe dial appears to be the two part pancake style but unfortunately the lume on the dial is absent, although there is some lume on the hands.\n\nThe back of the watch is press fitted rather than screwed on and the case appears to be chromed something (likely zinc) rather than stainless steel, also the band is held on with spring bars instead of screws.\n\nAll in all for the price, you can not go wrong with this watch!", "summary": "Excellent homage watch", "unixReviewTime": 1453161600}

I am usually skeptical of ordering clothing items online because every person's body is different and one shirt review doesn't necessarily mean it is going to magically fit another person, but this one truly is a magical tunic top! The material is light and airy, and has enough of a gentle cling in the bust and shoulder area to not make anyone look like they are wearing a tent. I adore the flow-y nature of this top, as well as the length. I am rather busty with wide shoulders and am fairly short, so I worried that this top would make me look like a circus tent and be too long, but it honestly was a perfect length. It hugs all the right spots and hides the spots many other girls usually like to cover.

I washed them and they still feel strange, but nothing has come off on my hands, so it's a draw.

Fortunately, that was not the case with these. They're soft, comfortable, and flexible, all without falling down or hanging loose in areas where you want them to remain tight. They truly do look like jeans and unless someone were to walk up and touch them, they probably wouldn't know that it's not true denim.\n\nI ordered the Navy Blue in XXL because I wanted something that actually looked like true denim. My regular size is 16/18 and these fit perfectly. I like to wear them with my black knee-high boots because there is no bunching up at the bottom, so my boots slide right over them with ease.\n\nI wash my jeggings on the regular cycle and dry them on high. I didn't realize until the third wash that you're supposed to handwash them and tumble dry. Oops! Fortunately, I haven't noticed any shrinkage, damage, or color-fading. They're still in great shape with the same dark blue color.\n\nBecause these are so versatile and comfortable, you can wear it with almost anything at any time. I highly recommend them.\n\n* I received this product at no cost in exchange for an unbiased review.

I wear a small in US clothes so I order xl or 2xl depending on recommendations from the seller or other Amazon customers. Like I said I can get an xl or 2xl and be great. With this \"jacket\", I ordered an xl thinking that if it's a tiny bit snug, it would be fine. Now this \"xl\" is a kids and I mean like size 4 to 7 \"xl\". I can put it on and it's  a \"fat man in a little coat\" situation! I feel like I'm wearing my 8 year old son son's shirt!

Literally all of them, where was quality control that day!? To top it off, it does not close and not because of how it fits me but because it physically has no way of closing! The buttons are all loosely sown on for decoration. In the pictures the girl is wearing  it open and apparently that is the only option! Oh and you  can see through it, it's so darn thin! This is by far THE WORST THING I have ever gotten from Amazon. I can't even give it away as it doesn't close. I understand the whole you get what you pay for but this thing would be useless if it were free!\nI would not recommend anyone buying this unless you are like super duper tiny and if you are that small, you poor thing,you will freeze, this thing will not keep you warm, it's too thin and it doesn't fasten...at all!

I really hate leaving really bad reviews. You kind of get the impression you're buying an item that is hand made, not mass produced in China. It comes sort of attached to a card that says made in China on it. The quality is appalling. It arrived broken. The rose on the ring had come off. I don;t know where they get their measurements for a wrist, but it's clearly not from a human adult. The part that goes on your wrist couldn't possibly be expected to fit an average persons wrist. What you can't see in the picture is the extender chain. Yes, a lot of bracelets have them. But, usually you don't really need them. Maybe an extremely anorexic person could wear this without using the extender.  The glue used to hold the rose and other decorative parts is obviously very cheap if it can't even last long enough to make it to the buyer. The entire item is so poorly made and obviously slapped together on an assembly line. Not handmade. The chains are not metal, as they appear in the photo. Most of it is cheap plastic and the clasp is uneven. To be honest I have purchased much nicer items at The Dollar Store. I showed it to my neighbor and she said she could make a better one. Looking at some other reviews I see this is a problem for others as well.\n\nI did contact the seller. They responded promptly and offered to send me another one and even provided a link to the item. However, it was not for the in the picture. It was for a white one with a completely different design.

I ordered the large too just to see the size difference, I'll probably update once it comes in.  I'm 5'2, 112, larger through the chest, and the S fits ok just a little snug around the arms/shoulders.  The length hits right at the top of my hips, which is perfect.  The back is quite low; I can wear a regular bra, but it takes some wiggling and maybe some fabric tape.  It seems well made enough for the price; it's not a high end piece, but it's not a high end price, either.  It's a really flattering little shirt, and a nice balance of sexy and covered up; this wouldn't work with a too-low neckline.  The edges are raw and the button that holds the back together isn't exactly solidly attached (nothing a few stitches can't fix), but again, at this price point, that's to be expected.  The arms are cut slim, and the back does flip open quite a bit.  I plan on wearing a very minimal black bra underneath and think it'll be fine, but if you're comfortable braless, that's probably the way to go.\n\nEdit to update: I bought the large as well, and it fit MUCH better than the small.  I didn't see a huge size difference between the two, honestly, the large just gave me enough room to move without feeling like I was going to hulk out of the shirt.  I think the medium would've been perfect, as the large was maybe a wee touch loose, but the medium wasn't Prime at the time and I needed it quickly.

I looked at separates, but I couldn't get items that matched well enough (color and material wise) to appeal to me, so based on the reviews, I took a chance on buying this 3-piece suit online (thinking I would just mail it back if it didn't fit). It does fit! He wears a size 36R jacket and this one fits almost perfectly. The shoulders even leave just a little room for growth. The ONLY downside to this suit is that my son has really long arms, and the sleeves fit him so well now that they will probably end up being too short fairly soon. There are no store bought pants that I can find that will fit my son, as by the time the waist fits him, they end up being way too short. These pants however are size a 29 waist and are really long with no bottom hem, so they are the closest I have been able to come in the waist and Ill have them hemmed to the perfect length. These pants look nice and should fit him for quite some time. The vest fits as well and looks so much better than the ones I had him try on at local stores. Im not a fashion expert, so I won't speak in detail about the quality of the material or the cut of the suit, but it seems like nice material to me and my son and I both love how it looks on him.

Based on the size chart, I got a medium and it fits a little baggy. I was inbetween sizes so I had a good feeling this would be baggy.\n\nA couple issues I have with it:\n-  the fabric is very thin. So thin if you hold it up you can see light shining through the fabric. Overall though, the outer fabric feels smooth and the inner fabric is soft... Just as you would expect from an old school hoodie.\n- I wish the sleeves were a little longer\n- I wish the length was a little longer. It's not too short but an inch or two longer would have been nice.\n- the hood is tiny...like it only covers half my head! And my head is not unusually large\n\nAll in all, I like the look of the hoodie and will wear it on not so cold days when I need a long sleeve layer thicker than a third but thinner than my fleece. It's a nice step up from the plain Hanes hoodies from when I was younger.\n\nI did receive this hoodie at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest review. Would I buy it again... Not sure.

I ordered this to wear to my husbands company Christmas party. It looks much better than expected. This dress has two layers. I believe the lining is polyester and may have a small mix of spandex because it is very stretchy. The outer layer is chiffon and has some lace. This dress is very comfortable yet sexy also.\n\nMeasurements for XL\n\nChest: 19 wide\n\nWaist: 16.5 wide\n\nSleeve Length: 23 long (from shoulder seam)\n\nLength: 56 long (from shoulder to bottom hem)\n\nThe front of the dress has a low cut cross-over V-neck. The chest area has some ruching. The shoulders and arms have a gorgeous lace design. Im pleasantly surprised that the lace sleeves are not tight at all. I can easily move around and be comfortable. It has a small amount of stretch to it. The bottom of the sleeves have a unique look with a scalloped edge and some fraying.\n\nUnder the chest area is more decorative lace that goes all the way around the dress. The lace is approximately 1.5 wide. There is about a 27 slit up the right leg. Its a straight cut and not opened. In other words the dress still closes and does not have an open gap. Theres some ruching under the lace band which gives the bottom of the dress a great amount of flow. This also helps to keep the slit closed more because theres more fabric. Im not one to show my legs but I do feel comfortable with the way this dress is made.\n\nThe back is very sexy yet still conservative. The upper portion of the back is the same lace that continues from the shoulders and arms. Underneath this lace is more chiffon with ruching. The back closes by a single gold button that is attached to the back of the lace. This gold button fits into a loop to close. This can be difficult to undo sometimes but I eventually get it done. Underneath is like a thin oval opening back. Below this is an 11 invisible zipper.\n\nThe bottom of the dress have a very tiny hem and the stitching is superb. The length of this dress is perfect on me. I can wear flat or heels. This dress looks amazing dressed up with some nice jewelry. I wore this to a small event recently and cant wait to dress it up more for my husbands company Christmas party in a few weeks. I received lots of compliments and it was really comfortable to wear for the several hours that I had it on. I love all the beautiful details and how sexy yet classy it looks. I am very happy with this dress and I would recommend it for any special occasion.

When I received the package, before even opening it, I could hear the rattle of beads.  I opened the envelope to find a very pretty box with a bow, but when I opened the box I found the whole bracelet was in pieces, the string was just laying in the box with all the beads/stones just loose in the box, it was almost like a little kit that you would put together yourself.  I was so very disappointed because it is a very nice looking bracelet.  I do not know how it even came apart completely, either bad workmanship, or shipping issue.\n\n*I was contacted by customer service at Amorstore, regarding the damaged bracelet I received.  They looked into the problem and found that when made, the string was to tight which resulted in making the bracelet snap.  They have kindly sent me a replacement, and when I received the bracelet, it was in a nice box, and was perfectly made.  It is a beautiful bracelet, and I appreciated all the help and concern I received from Amorstore customer service.", "summary": "and it had received good reviews.

I received a bracelet for testing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased review.\n\nI really like the Boho style of this bracelet. I chose the Midnight Black design but there are 5 other color schemes that could probably go with any of outfit you own. These bracelets can be worn dressed up or dressed down, paired with other bracelets or just worn individually. I really like how attractive the color schemes are.\n\nThe bracelet, for the most part, is made of plastic and is extremely light weight. It really doesnt weigh down your wrist, but I was hoping the materials used would be more hardy and durable. The whole bracelet is stretchy and elastic and can fit almost any size wrist. They are easy to slip on and off and don't really get in the way. There are a total of seven varying layers that makes up the whole Bohemian style bracelet. The main layer, the beads layer can also be worn alone.\n\nThese are inexpensive bracelets that make great stocking stuffers or bracelets. They look great for the price and look a lot more expensive than they are. Great style!", "summary": "Stylish and Attractive Bohemian Style 7-Layer Bracelet", "unixReviewTime": 1444780800}

I got this bag to hold my laptop and clothes for a small day pack for a two week long trip, and it fulfilled it's purpose. This bag holds an 8\" width x 12\" length x 14\" diagonal laptop easily with lots of room. It can also hold a 10\" w x 15\" l x 18\" d laptop extremely snugly but bordering on uncomfortably.\nPros:\nBag is incognito while traveling.\nThe bag can hold 2 outfits (read: 2 NEATLY PACKED outfits,) snacks, toiletries, and a 14\" d laptop fit in the main compartment comfortably at the same time. A cell phone charger, small/medium smart phone, and wallet can fit in the zippered pocket.\nThis is a structurally sound bag. This bag survived an international flight (from Germany to Toronto, Canada) holding 3 two liter bottles. The bag was taut around the bottles but shows no signs of stress after the trip ended.\nCons:\nThe \"D loop strap\" attached to the zipper at the top of the bag intended for one of the contact points for the attachable duffel strap is partially disintegrated (1/4th of the webbing is ripped,) after wear and tear for several weeks.\nThe padding is barely sufficient for a laptop.\nThe zipper to the main compartment seems like it will eventually come apart or even break if the bag is not zipped fully while carrying weight.\nThe buckles holding the straps are troublesome to fasten/unfasten and catch easily on things around the bag.\n\nDisclosure Statement: This product was provided to me for free/discounted in exchange for my honest review", "summary": "That'll do bag, that'll do.", "unixReviewTime": 1466035200}

This bag excels is this regard. It is a backpack, a shoulder bag, and a duffel.\n\nOn the outside you have two grab handles, one on the side and one on the end. You can carry it vertically or horizontally. You also have the option to wear the bag as a backpack with the built in straps. These backpack straps can also hide away if you are using the other carrying options. Finally you can carry the bag via the included shoulder strap. I was pleasantly surprised to find it inside the bag. I have a few bags that cost 5-10 times what this bag costs and they didn't include a strap.\n\nContinuing with the functionality theme, the bag features built in compression straps on the outside. There are two on each side so you can cinch down the contents to keep the bag in shape. Finally there is a small zippered pouch on the outside for storing items needed for easy access.\n\nOn the inside of the bag there is a medium sized, lightly padded sleeve. The sleeve is closed using a velcro strap. You could store a laptop or a tablet and then secure it with the velcro strap. The rest of the inside is just one large compartment. This can be good or bad depending on what you store in the bag. You can use the compression straps to control the shape if you are storing soft goods inside.\n\n The bag is very discreet. It does not have any logos or branding, not even a subtle one. I think this is a good thing since I am not a fan of large logos or branding on a bag of this style.\n\nThis bag would be good for short trips or even as a gym bag. You could probably even use it as a backpack for work or school. You could easily fit some shoes inside and a few days worth of clothes.\n\nI've attached some photos to show how the bag opens and how the backpack straps can be hidden. There is also a shot of the inside of the bag.\n\nDisclosure Statement: I received this product at a discount so that I could provide a fair and unbiased review.

The first time i tried this shirt on it was rather stiff. That being said, i like the medium weight of the fabric. It isn't cheap at all and it is 100% cotton. Definitely a shirt for fall. The fit was a little boxy and long which felt a little awkward for me. I decided to wash it in a gentle cycle and briefly put it in the dryer. The fit was much more comfortable after the wash and dry. The sleeves did shrink and now hit just above my wrist bone. Not good for wearing with the sleeve rolled down. I don't really mind though because i like the sleeves rolled up. The length now comes to just below the crotch area (instead of mid-thigh before wash). It has the straps and buttons on the sides which look cute and cover the bum enough to wear with leggings. Please pay very careful attention to the sizing chart.

It has four faces... Time, date, day of week, 24 hour face. On mine, no matter what we tried, the day of week wouldn't adjust\n\n-directions for adjusting the faces or removing links are online in the photos of the product, but are not included with the watch, making it difficult as a gift.\n\nI was given a free or deeply discounted sample to test and review, but have offered only my own opinions and observations. I really love the way this watch looks, and feels. It seems to keep time well. And the other faces adjust fine. If giving this as a gift i suggest you first adjust all the settings, and print the directions for adjusting them and for removing links and give with the gift.\n\nBy the way, removing links wasn't easy but was possible exactly as the directions explained.", "summary": "Beautiful watch!", "unixReviewTime": 1473033600}

Given my penchant for finding interesting clothes, its not often that I buy new, its hard for me to find the uniqueness and character in brand new clothes  Plusasa is changing that for me! Plusasa has a fashion line that gives me the option to buy high-quality new clothes that have a fresh, unique, edginess that set them apart from mall clothes. The La Lune Sleeveless T-Shirt is my newest addition from Plusasa.\n\nThe La Lune Fashion T-Shirt is a well-made sleeveless T that provides an androgynous edge to a decidedly feminine cut shirt. Sizing is import-standard  I am 53 and around 135 and the XL shirt fits me perfectly. The Polyester base is blended with lycra, nylon, and elastane to keep this top washable, wearable, and looking as good as the first day I wore it. The weight of the fabric falls between a standard t-shirt material and a light broadcloth which lets the shirt drape beautifully while having the softness to gently hug those girl curves. The sleeves have a deep urban cut-off look but don't fray even with repeated wear due to the high-quality material. The printed design is bold and well-defined with no color bleed. The finished neckline is classic girl-t style and the fold-over is expertly tailored. Hem and seams are double stitched and all stitching is straight, even, and perfect. Designer tag at the inside waist line means no tag at the neckline which I love!\n\nI received the Plusasa La Lune Round Neck T-Shirt at a promotional cost in exchange for an unbiased review and love the great quality, the unique design, and I especially love the outstanding versatility of this top.", "summary": "High quality fashion shirt top.

I have to admit that when i noticed that the seller was from China after I bought the dresses I requested a cancellation of the order since just the week before buying this one's I had a really bad experience with another seller from China. But i was so in love with the dresses that i struggled with the decision of cancelling,  I sent an email to the seller asking her if she can send me a picture of a dress that she actually made and not one from a catalogue.  She didn't sent me one she sent me a bunch of them. I was happy with what I saw and decided to stay with her and that was THE BEST decision that I could take. Thru the whole process she was emailing me if I had any doubts and when she finished she sent me pictures of the dresses, I asked her if she could add more tulle and she did it with out any excuse or getting mad about it. The end result is beautiful and the dresses are made with good materials, and to top that it only took for the dresses 3 days to get here from CHINA I am amazed. I would highly recommend this seller they are awesome!  Note: In the pictures you are not going to be able to see the bow that has on the back cause is detachable and I didn't attached it before I took the pictures (hope that I can upload more pictures from the day of the event) also since I'm referring about 2 dresses I'm going to upload a picture of the other one too cause I'm going to copy this review to the other one and I don't want you to think that this is a scam.", "summary": "This dress is beautiful, I bought this and another one for my ...", "unixReviewTime": 1458691200}

Plus it's not terribly stable without any recessed area to work with the curve of your head. It has both a solid headband and an elastic band to secure the hat. The elastic was pretty much worthless in terms of helping the hat to stay on my head, so I removed it. The headband is pretty sturdy, although the hat is tall enough to wobble around a bit. If you're crafty and can attach combs to the ends of the headband, that would probably help to hold it in place. It's still a cute accent for my costume, and I like it fine.

Now I was conflicted on what to rate this review because of the sizing, but really other than it being way smaller, the actual sports bra is really nice.  So if you are looking to purchase these, please keep in mind their sizing.\n\nThe sports bra looks more like a bra in the front.  The cups are shaped and padded like bras are and they an under wire in them.  The back has a strap and a also a razorback as well.  My friend says they are very comfortable to wear and she likes to workout in them also.\n\nThe bras have a zebra print with a mesh fabric over it.  The set I got was all in neon colors: 2 aqua colors, 1 neon pink and 1 neon orange.  The straps are not adjustable but no sports bras are.  She says these do give good support.\n\nThe sports bras seem to be made nicely and she says she washing them in her delicate cycle and hasn't had any issues.  I do recommend them, if you get the right size.\n\n**I did receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.

The colors and pattern of them are an absolute LOVE! Main downside, they run small and unfortunately didn't fit my daughter which is who I got them for.

After wearing for a few hours, it was digging into her too much where it became uncomfortable and she needed to change it. The cup part fit her, it was just snug around the back.\n\nThese sports bras though are well made and there were no loose threads and all the stitching is done well. I like how the cup has a netting type look to it. The racerback is nice to wear with tank tops that have that back so you don't see your bra straps. There is a normal type bra hook in the back which is 2 hooks for the XL and then there are 3 hooks for adjusting. The shoulder straps are not adjustable. You receive an assortment of colors. We received 2 Turquoise, 1 Pink and 1 Orange and like I mentioned, the colors are nice and bright and so pretty. I still gave these 4 stars because they really are a nice quality sports bra, it's just we had an issue with the fit and them running small which is a chance you take when ordering online unfortunately.\nI received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

I never switch to a small purse now because this holds so much!**\n For over a year I have ONLY carried a phone pouch with a few card slots and my keys hanging off the side of it. The strap was finally giving away and Apple Pay isn't being adopted as fast as I want and need to carry more cards, so I figured it was time to find a new one. Phone carrying wallets are easy to find, phone carrying wallets that are smaller than average while still having tons of space are not...until this wallet!  I have an iPhone 6s with a thin bumper style case on it and it is a perfect fit. It would probably fit one a bit bigger but not by much. When I upgrade to the 6plus I might have to find a new wallet because I do not believe it will fit. Which makes me kinda sad because I want to order a few more colors but that is the downfall of going bigger and refusing to carry a purse.\n\nIt shows the phone can be slid into an opening between the cards and a large roomy zipper pocket, but that makes me nervous. It is snug but will it stay that way after usage?  I hang this thing from my wrist and go, would hate to have my phone drop out. If I am in meetings/sitting all day I would use that part to save the zipper then switch to the pocket when I leave.  I use the large zipper part for the phone as I do not have much to carry. I hang my keys on the side with the wristlet.  If I trusted the phone pocket I could fit my keys, a Chapstick, and other stuff in the other pocket, but then it would be bulky.  There is also a large coin pocket behind the big zipper area. I use that for a few punch cards, a 4.5 inch stylus, and my challenge coin with plenty of room to spare!!\n\nI like the slim look knowing that if I needed to I could put whatever I need to take with me in there as well. With the card slots full (some even with 2 cards per slot), the stuff mentioned in the coin section, and my phone it measures just under 2 inches thick. My last one was smaller than that so this seems big to me, but I am now carrying 14 cards instead of 6 as well as plenty of other stuff.  It's a win and I am glad I chose this one.\n\nI actually had to buy this twice because the first one got lost in transit. Said it was delivered but still hasn't shown up.

With an original price tag of 24.95 I will tell you this item is not worth it at that price. The beads feel more like a \"metal plated\" plastic, the metals the small charms are made of appear to be a weak and cheap alloy, and the links holding the little gymnasts to the bracelet will probably break apart and loose those little charms pretty quickly assuming the elastic string holding the whole thing together doesn't snap first. The box it comes in is a pretty standard cheap gift box, something you could purchase at your local dollar store. Was really hoping for a little better quality at this price.

Also the way it fits means constantly pushing the straps up your shoulders so the straps don't fall. I think this may have to do with my bust size and may be better for smaller breasted people. It is low cut in the back so if you have back rolls like me, just know I felt a lil uncomfortable. Def not for swimming, but I already knew that. The thing is ANY stretch what so ever will cause the heart cut outs to turn into circles. So when I sit and move and contort myself they are just circles. Which I guess is understandable and all. I think that this is definitely going to suit petite thin women. I am 5'5\" with a short torso and it is a bit \"short\" on me, the top comes down real low.

I was also really happy to see that the print of the suit is just as colorful and vibrant as shown in the picture! (I posted pictures so you can see).\nThe material of the suit seems pretty good. The bottoms are a more softer spandex, and the top is more of a structured neoprene on the inside, with the soft spandex print on the outside. Both the top and bottoms are double lined. The bottoms have the same print on the inside as the outside (which is good in case your bottoms get accidentally readjusted in the water lol) but the top is white on the inside. The top is very structured, so if you're looking for a more flimsier top to just lay on your skin, this isn't it. The top is also lightly padded at the bottom of the cups to give you a slight lift, but there's no side slit for you to add your own padding or take out theirs. I also wouldn't recommend cutting your own slit either due to the way the top is so structured. The bottoms are a more skimpier cut (i.e there's not too much coverage), but they're also not a thong cut either, which is exactly how I like mine :)\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend the suit and am excited to wear it this summer!", "summary": "Super cute and came exactly as shown!

I don't normally like those features on a round watch face, because it makes it hard to decipher the time.  However, because the face of this watch is square, it breaks it up more so that you can easily still see these features and tell time.  I wasn't too sure that it was going to be comfortable to wear because it is made of wood, but I was wrong!  The wood is super smooth and feels comfortable to wear.  I will say that if you have a hairy arm, it tends to pull the hairs a little bit.  If you are looking for something unique, this is the watch for you.  Please know that everything that I have written about this product is how I really feel about it and you can read my reviews with confidence.

The little thin veil skirt beneath the outer dress to make it stick out is very scratchy against the skin. The hat was small on the head too, like other people said.\nLastly, the dress wasn't very fitting for my shape (I'm a bit on the thick side, being a lil curvy). My \"frontal region\" was out all over the place so I had to pin it a little bit shut, thus causing the hoop of the skirt to not puff out as much. If you're more like a stick figure, maybe this is for you..? Like if you're really thin waisted and have a slightly bigger bust? The lace tying the top shut wouldn't be perfectly even x's all the way down, no matter how many ways I tried tying it.

It is adorable. My industrial had to be pierced on the shorter side due to me having smaller ears and it is really hard to find a barbell that fits perfectly and this one does! The quality of this item is top notch and I have had no issues with sensitivity which is impressive. This item has held up very well the past few months that I have owned it and I get a lot of compliments on it. I would give this item 5 stars however one thing that really doesn't work for me about this item is how inflexible it is. If it gets the slightest touch it doesn't move or allow my ear to bend. I have to wear my barbells 24/7 and this is the worst one to sleep in. It has very little give. However that being said it is also one of my favorites in my collection at the moment. I can easily brush my hair and nothing gets caught up in it which is a huge bonus. Overall the quality of this item is amazing and I recommend it but just remember there is little give so if you have a healing piercing this may be one to save and show off when things are fully healed.", "summary": "I really enjoy this barbell", "unixReviewTime": 1470787200}

I like that I can squeeze to bend it so its a little tighter, but even if I get the two Ts practically touching its still pretty loose on my wrist (not loose enough that it will fall off mind you, it just flops around quite a bit). I wore it to a wedding last weekend, and it was loose enough that I found myself fiddling with it constantly. I think it would fit well on people with average sized wrists, but large wrists might have to stretch the bracelet out so far that it would look weird. I like the simplicity of this bracelet. It doesnt have anything else going on besides the band and the two T ends, and the silver is nice and bright and shiny. My husband really likes it, which surprised me because he doesnt often comment on my costume jewelry. I like the look of it myself, so Im glad to have it on hand and Ill wear it when Im going simplistic with my jewelry. I think it is of average quality for costume jewelry, which is fine with me. I think the price is a little high for what you get, but not terrible. I feel like the edges of the T ends could be a little smoother. They aren't exactly sharp, but the edges aren't rounded at all, so they feel a little pointed. Overall I like the bracelet, but its nothing all that special. I would say my favorite thing about it is that my husband likes it - if it wasn't for that I probably wouldnt wear it all that often.\n\nDisclosure:  I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion.", "summary": "Not bad, but not my favorite", "unixReviewTime": 1463011200}

There are so many well-known stores selling similar products, cant beat the quality and price at all with these lovely bows. These bows came in a zipper bag, colors and patterns are exactly the same as described. They are so cute and bigger than I expected but size would not bother me. Even I received these bows with a huge discount in exchange for my honest review, I will be willing to pay full price for these bows and highly recommend to all my friends.\nHere are the reasons why you will not be disappointed:\n1. The beautiful variety design and lovely color pattern are definitely attractive points; you can match any outfit easily. They looks great in my little ones black hair\n2. The bows fabric quality is so soft and the edges were straightly cut.\n3. Perfect size and stay in place on my little ones fine thin hairs\n4. Very light and kids don't even notice, so they cant rip them off their heads.\n5. I checked every single one before I put them on my kids because you don't want to cut any hair with sharp edge of the clip. These bows are really well-made and neat, no razor sharp clips like others and no fraying on the ribbon\n6. The metal barrettes glued very well to the bows, I don't even see any glue leftover on the fabric.\nI hope my review and photos will help you. If you are shopping for your little ones Christmas gifts, this won't make them disappointed.", "summary": "Lovely Christmas gifts for your little one", "unixReviewTime": 1448064000}

The alligator clips are hot-glued on the bows.\n\nHere are some pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n# There are FIVE different sets. Usually you buy a set of hair clips with the same pattern but different colors. These are not! You get 5 sets different patterns/sizes/shapes hair bows and there are 4 different colors in each set. You can find one that fits your kids outfit easily.\n# The price. You will probably pay the same amount of money but only get 5 or maybe 8 bows. Yet with this deal, you get 20 bows! Every bow is less than one dollar.\n# These are sturdy hair clips that stay on baby fine thin hair. I might need to fix it for my daughter if she is playing with it but the clips stay in place even with windy weather.\n# They are just so adorable!\n\nCons:\nThere is no bow that is mainly green or red.\n\nBottom line: This is a good buy.

Good thing are they are a bit stouter than other trail shoes which I like, but useless for really any long walks. I suggest the company makes a stout trail/walking shoe which does not stretch out and they make a few more in between sizes to choose from.

I ordered a large, which usually fits me perfectly, but this fit like I'd just tried to squeeze myself into a small.\n\nWith all these problems, there was no way I was going to keep it, as I payed $30 for something that is absolutely terrible. When I contacted the company about returning it because it didn't fit, they offered to give me $15 back and I would \"keep the product.\" I replied back saying that it didn't fit, so I wanted to return it and get a full refund.

No tracking available despite giving me a number and carrier. Quality is good, strong string and no visible loose ends or anything that could potentially unravel.\n\nCame as 5 bundles of 10 bracelets, each bundle contained multiples of the exact same type of bracelet. The bundles themselves differed from each other but only slightly. Nothing like what the pictures they show for advertising. I received all the same style but the colors were slightly changed up, in all of the bundles it's the same colors just in a different order going down the bracelet. Pictures advertised show many different types of styles and weaves, there were all one weave with just different colored strings used for each bundle.\n\nOverall the bracelets are of good quality and vibrant colors. The problem lies with the lack of diversity. If I were giving out these in a goody bag of some sort it would work well, but I was under the impression I would get an assortment and could give them out to friends. Very cheap price, but not a good buy if you were looking to use these for a more intimate gift giving experience between close friends, instead you have 50-odd bracelets that would work better for giving out to a class of students as rewards or such.

I sized up after reading the reviews and then found that the item fit a little too large. The style itself also wasn't really what I expected. To be fair though, I don't feel like the product was marketed in a way that was misleading. What I got looks like the photographs. It just didn't wear the way I hopped. It fits as though it was meant for a much younger girl. There also isn't any curve to the sweater at all. If you are naturally curvy than the look of this top may be a bit more flattering on you. I'm not super curvy though (at least not up top) so I feel like I just looked a little childish in it.\n\nI can say that the material is quite nice. It arrived in good condition and is made from a thicker fabric. There is nothing wrong with the quality at all.\n\nI'm 5ft 5in, 123 lbs, a 29 in natural waist, and wear a 34b. My suggestion for smaller builds closer to mine would be to go with the small but if you've got more natural curves than go with the medium. My guess is that the smaller size would form to someone's body shape more and look less childish for potential buyers who's curves are a little less pronounced.\n\nAlso please note!!! This item ships from China so if you get he wrong size it will be very expensive to return. I went back and forth with Amazon customer service in an effort to find a solution (they were very helpful) but it was a process that not everyone will have the time or patience for.

In the picture and in person, it was indeed, pretty, and it had many competitors.  I was looking for some 'sparkle', in the form of rhinestones or crystals, and this item looked like it would fit the bill with ease.  It fit the bill with ease, until I took it out of the box. (note: badly packed!) I picked the bracelet carefully out of the box, and along with my assistant, took a deep breath and saw--IT!  \"IT\" was a gap, which in such a pretty organized line-up of rhinestones, just it's missing that ONE, STONE, but it made the impact of it look so much more shocking!  Of course it wasn't a crack in the Hope diamond or anything as dramatic as that, it was just that the disruption in the flow of the rhinestones really did make one draw a deep breath, the flaw was so...flagrant!\n\nUnfortunately, this is where I had the difficulty with the seller.  I'm used to rudeness, par for many courses, but this was a record for me.  I wrote requesting a replacement, and was 'met', with demands for photos, etc.  I attempted to send photos, but as anyone who has tried to photograph jewelry, especially clear, rhinestone jewelry, knows it's hard to get a good shot, much less to download from tablet/phone, to PC, and send..whatever.

They were bright and cheerful and plush and warm -- perfect for the winter.  This year, I tried buying a larger size for my now almost 5-yr-old, but the size chart made no sense to me (due to the difference in American and Chinese sizings).  I made my best guess and ordered a size 130.  To my disappointment, the leggings were too small for my daughter (whose first pair, I subsequently discovered, are labeled size 130 -- but they are actually bigger than the new pair that I just bought)! In addition, the new pair is thinner and less plush than the first pair.  Needless to say, I'm disappointed.  I still think the rainbow stripes design is adorable, but I wish larger sizes were available.
