I thought the top had cups in it, which it did not (the model HAS to be wearing some kind of supportive cup for her figure to look like that; no one is shaped like that or that smooth without support). I am a C, so I need support. The top made me look saggy, not sexy, and I thought I was going to poke right through it, so to speak. I emailed the seller to ask for suggestions on how to improve the top and got an automatic reply from Amazon saying to allow 2 days for a response. I never got a response from the seller. I have taken the top and cups I bought to an alterations person, and I am hoping she will be able to fix it to my satisfaction.\n\nThe skirt is definitely big, but it is very adjustable, so no problems there. The shorts are a nice addition so you can decide how exposed you want to be. In general, it's a pretty costume if it fits you right. If you're smaller than a C cup, you might be fine with it as it is, but if you're any bigger, I'd say steer clear unless you plan to purchase some kind of adhesive or sew-in cups. It's reasonably priced, but I think it's important to know that you're not getting any kind of support or shape from the top so you can decide if you want to either invest the extra time and effort to add some, or pay a little more for a costume that already has what you need in that area.", "summary": "The bra top looks good on the model", "unixReviewTime": 1462492800}

Anyways, it's actually pretty small on me the material is too tight on my thighs and bathing suit area which is very uncomfortable, I want to return this back and get a bigger size (I don't know if I can but whatever) even if I could return it it wouldn't be back in time for a Halloween party I'm going to on the 21st next month because it took 2 and a half weeks for this butt pad to come in and it would probably take even longer to send back because it's sent from China and then once it gets in China it would have to be sent back and that would just be too late for the party I'm going to :(( this barely has any padding and doesn't really make difference at all, I don't know if I could try to stretch it out by pulling on it with my hands so it will actually feel comfortable and not break but I guess I'll have to see :/ I do not recommend this if you're expecting a big difference ..

It also came with its own 20\" chain.\n\nThis necklace is positively stunning, and pictures (although provided for your viewing pleasure) simply can't show the breathtaking beauty.  I have gotten compliments on it every single day!\n\nThe gems on this necklace are aligned the same as your chakra is supposed to be in relation to placement on your body.  (From the base of your spine to the crown of your head).  They are very vibrant, and I love having this with me everyday :). I think attention to my chakras definitely makes my energy and spirt much better :)\n\nEach of the chakra gems are bedded into the beautiful amethyst quartz block (amethyst for mine anyhow is the color).  The block is very smooth and polished so well.  It really reflects the light wonderfully.  I have since taken this off the necklace that came with it.  The chain is quite beautiful, but it is too dainty for me since I'm wearing it everyday so I did take a star as I feel this needs a heavier chain.  I have placed it onto a premier jewelry necklace I already had, and it's a wonderful combination.

I chose the damask print.  I am 5'1\" and weigh 160.6 lbs at 30 weeks pregnant.  I wear a 38D and the measurement under my bust/ribcage is 35.5\".  I selected the medium and it fits really nicely.  It definitely fits as expected.  This dress fit my bust perfectly and did not scoop too low in the front.  I am able to wear my maternity bra (kindred bravely nursing bra) with no issues.  I get chest pains under my bust if what I'm wearing is too tight under my bust.  This was not too snug and I do feel that I have room to grow without being too restricted.  At 5'1\" the length works, but I will most likely hem the length up atleast 1\".  I do not see this adjustment as a negative factor because I would rather it be a little longer, so that I can adjust the hem, rather than too short and not be able to make an adjustment to the length because of a lack of fabric.  My 30 week belly is super cute and I cannot wait to wear this out and about.  Love this so much that I just placed an order for another print.

I took a chance and ordered it anyway, and wiped down my rainboots with it and boy, does it make a difference! Not only did it bring a subtle gloss back to my boots, but I can tell from touching it that there seems to be some kind of wax-like repellent (very subtle) in it, from the way water just beads right off my boots, the way rain beads off of a waxed car. Even though it says to use this on Joules boots, I tried it on my other (non-Joules) rainboots and on a pair of duck skimmers, and same thing.. nice subtle gloss with a waxy overlay. Here are some pics of the before & after shots of my Joules boots as well as my other rain footwear, so you can see for yourself. Pic with the short boots with this bottle is the \"After\" pic; pic of these boots without the bottle is the \"Before\" pic.\nTip: The instructions say to spray the product on the boot itself, but I found that it works best when you spray 3-4 times on a soft, absorbant cloth like a microfiber cloth, and wipe the boot down. I'd recommend 3-4 sprays on the cloth PER boot. (2-3 sprays on the cloth PER shoe, if buffing shoes.) When you spray directly onto the boot / shoe, it runs off and does not seem to distribute as well on the entire boot / shoe.", "summary": "Makes a notable difference!", "unixReviewTime": 1461542400}

I used the MR00s mainly as trainers for gym workouts and really loved their no-frills, low-profile approach. Unfortunately, the 200 Trainers don't live up to my experience with the MR00 for a number of reasons.\n\nIt starts with the outsole. The MR00 had a flat outsole that gave you good stability for weightlifting and enough traction for agility work. The 200 Trainers have sufficient traction, and the outsole seems at least as durable as the MR00's, if not more so. But the outsole on the 200 Trainers is curved to the shape of the foot. It feels fine anatomically, but the curvature is pronounced enough that there's a little wobble to them on flat surfaces. Not to the point of being dangerous, but definitely something I was conscious of when squatting or performing weighted single leg exercises.\n\nThe upper, though it appears durable, is also a step back from the MR00 in my opinion. The front of the 200 Trainers is a stiff reinforced material that isn't as comfortable against the toes as the material of the MR00. While you could throw on the MR00 sockless and not feel uncomfortable, I can't say the same for the 200 Trainers. The lockdown of the midfoot is good, but I wouldn't say that was a problem I had with the MR00.\n\nThe real dealbreaker though is the heel. It's flexible and comfortable, but doesn't have enough structure to withstand rigorous activity. I knew I was done with the 200 Trainer when I literally walked out of them while doing sled pushes. It didn't matter how tight I tied them, the heel is just so flexible that I would push out of them after a few steps. For a trainer, this level of performance is just unacceptable.\n\nNew Balance has done some good things with this shoe, but overall it's just not a worth replacement to the MR00, and not at all worthy of the label \"trainer.\"", "summary": "I Miss the MR00", "unixReviewTime": 1471305600}

I would say this is New Balances take on the Vivobarefoot Motus. The outsole is tough and durable yet totally flexible, has a sort of a rounded shape to mimic natural foot contours. Rough measurement is the outsole is around 3 to 4mm. A difference to Vivos is the UX200 has a midsole of around 3 to 4mm which adds a tiny bit of cushion. This is very welcome as the Vivos are near impossible for walking on concrete and its not natural for humans to be walking on that hard a surface, whereas the UX allows for concrete with the slight added cushion. But remember this is still next to nothing compared with any other shoe.  No insole either, allows for better ground connection\nTo wear this form fitting glove like shoe you must get the correct size, ie way smaller than you think. Your feet and body must be in good strong shape with well formed arches.  Can take years to transition to this type of shoe. My foot is 270 mm at the longest toe, arch up, knees straight, no pronation or supination in lower leg. Legs inline with hips and outside edge of feet facing directly forward. I have size a 9US and fit is perfectly snug, that is my foot fills entire shoe at every point with toes almost touching end. I am 6 foot 2 tall and before transitioning to barefoot shoes used to wear size 11.5US runners and have progressively downsized. Takes many many shoe pairs of decreasing sizes to get down to perfect size, realigning feet and legs. Most people are wearing shoes too big for themselves , causing foot and body problems. This is opposite to the convention thinking of sizing up, exactly form fitting fit is what is required.\nNew Balances best minimalist shoe ever.

A lot of people get these kinds of shoes as some kind of \"macho\" statement or because they're a \"fad,\" but they were really conceptualized and designed with serious purpose in mind, promoting a balanced way of being closer to nature that goes far beyond just the mere athletic.\n\nThese shoes are for trail-walking and running but NOT for beginners since the minimal vibram sole will make the feet of beginners so sore, they won't be able to walk straight for a week. They feel like socks on your feet, that's how light they are! To get the maximum benefit of a shoe like this, you have to develop your full stride first, which, you cannot do without shoes like this that imitate or at least allow you to be \"almost barefoot\" and feel the ground in minute detail. For beginners who think they have the patience for this kind of training, I recommend the standard New Balance Minimus trail shoe which has slightly less ground feel but more arch support and ground grip on dirt trails.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/New-Balance-Mens-MT10V4-Trail/dp/B015XCQSV4/ref=pd_sim_309_4?ie=UTF8&refRID=T0YBAGJS5F1VD5CB3GHC\n\nI would train every other day on a trail with lots of uphills using the standard New Balance for one month and then starting the second month, I would use these even more minimal shoes once a week. After 4 months of hiking every other day, you should be able to use the UX200V1's every time. You have to go slow and concentrate on rudiments to the point of making sure each step you put on the floor is flat with a mid foot contact with the ground while YOU remain in far more control of your stride than gravity or momentum. This way each step is a soft landing with the force of the impact with the ground evenly distributed throughout your entire body and not just distributed into your foot and legs. It takes a couple of months of every-other-day slow training and maximum concentration on balanced landing on trails with all kinds of rocks and slopes for your feet to get strong enough so that the soreness only takes a couple of hours to relax itself and go away. But once that's done, the leverage you get from a stride that is balanced and fully controlled at all times is like having a bicycle with 50 gears. Slight movements of the legs, your feet, your body position, your arms, etc. all start making a huge difference and you start to get tired less and less. The next thing you notice is that few people can keep up with you because your strides become almost as fast as slow jogs, especially on uphills.\n\nAlso, as long as your landings are skillful, you glide over the ground with only the minimum contact necessary to propel you forward and the ground, especially ground made up of rocks and boulders and asphalt, will MASSAGE your feet and transfer stored energy into you. Yes, you read that right: if you do this kind of training right, you will be able to massage your feet on hard rocks and soft asphalt and absorb energy from the ground at the same time, while walking, jogging or running! lol  Running correctly in minimal style is not as \"easy\" as some people assume. It's not supposed to be done with the traditional runner's way of striking the foot to the ground. You have to learn to absorb impact in an entirely new way. Then you speed it up very gradually, never losing sight of the foundations built on how your feet contact and deal with the ground, until you have the jogging or \"running\" pace you want. .\n\nThis kind of training is really the wave of the future from the past, since for thousands of years people had minimal padding on their shoes. This is for those who want to be OF the mountain and OF the hill and canyon, not fighting the elements but in balanced harmony with them. I'd say they're more for those who meditate while they're training or for those who approach training as a form of meditation.", "summary": "Athletics for Meditation and Meditation through athletics", "unixReviewTime": 1473897600}

It is waterproof (see water test in my video).  This raincoat is not warm but it works very well to protect from rain.\n\nThe tricky part is to get the size right.  Asian sizes are different from American sizes (typically two sizes smaller) and not all sellers make it clear if the drop down list with sizes shows  American or Asian sizes.  Do not use the link to the chart size at the top of the listing.  The seller included Sizing table in the product description.  When I measured my raincoat with the measuring tape and compared it to the size chart they were accurate within one inch and my raincoat is a good fit.\n\nThe raincoat includes a detachable hood and belt. The raincoat closes with large buttons and the hood is attached by 4 small buttons.\n\nThis raincoat is provided to me by Bluetime to test the product and fit as part of a new product introduction.\n\nAli Julia review", "summary": "Sizing is tricky - use sizing chart in the product description", "unixReviewTime": 1445990400}

I had a parole meeting scheduled a few weeks back and I wanted to look good so I bought this suit. I had it delivered to one of the COs  houses that owed me a favor and he snuck it in for me. I put it on and my cellie Big Todd was really impressed. I went to the meeting and to my shock I was not supposed to dress up for it. They wanted me to show up in that ugly orange jumpsuit for some reason. I decided to tell the parole board the whole story as to how I got the suit and some other lurid details of what went on while I was behind bars.  The entire time though I noticed that the board members were not really listening to me, but admiring this suit. After about an hour of me spilling my guts about spilling guts I finished and waited for the board members to respond. It was like they were under a spell or something, but just then they awoke and voted on letting me out.

They're still okay, but a little less so now. With a longer skirt, I could probably hide the tear.", "summary": "Good", "unixReviewTime": 1493769600}

The length problem was a surprise, because 8 l/2 New Balance shoes have always worked in the past.\n\nIt's a nice looking shoe, a little dressier than the old Country Walkers, and the pink highlights of the chocolate bungee shoe are very understated.

This bracelet is pretty, but quite 'unfinished'. It is more interesting, it's more advanced, has a nicely 'finished' border, which indicated and follows a 'finished' braided style, which is quite nice. I think they can do better by virtue of this example of their abilities, so I hope they can learn to expand upon this more advanced design.  I find that there are still entirely too many open ends, where the wires aren't hooked closely enough, they still 'catch' on absolutely everything, and will ruin clothing of any type, irreparably.  It's too bad, I think with a little more care and perhaps more time, these bracelets, or 'cuffs',show promise.\nAgain, the attitude of the seller is another issue, so I'll let other customers reactions help to influence reactions to that, but good luck, nonetheless. suzette", "summary": "Okay, this won't catch on jeans, so you're okay with those, but still be careful about your top!

She is not worried about it, therefore i can sit back & smile that she is 100% (yes i said 100%!) excited & satisfied!!!! Absolutely adorable & very pleased! We both love how it slighty comes over the shoulders & the fact that it can be tighten if necessary and the 2 big buttons just under the face are the perfect touch!! Nice thickness for being so light also! Says its for a child in a certain age range- well my daughter is basically 6 & fits just right!! No complaints!! Even better was the quality of care in receiving a personal email (not through Amazon) from this company asking specifically if it fit my daughter & if i was satified, if i had any suggestions or even complaints. They were very interested in my person feedback. How many companies really care like that, honestly- come'on now!?! Major brownie points again!! Once my youngest daughter decides she also wants one, i will make sure i order from THIS company & hope by then they have just a couple more styles, or colors at least, so both my daughters don't have the EXACT same hood! A tiny difference would be nice & would guarantee another transaction from this household as my daughter has already asked for another kind!!!

With about 6 hours of experience, and with a product like that, this being enough, here are my findings. As a disclaimer, my experience includes wearing a tie each and every day for the last 15 years. I have hundreds of ties and enjoy my ties in that I believe they are a good way to depict my mood that morning. If I am wearing a bright tie I have a lot of energy, a dark tie I am feeling quiet, etc.. . In all of my years buying, wearing and in general being a consumer of manufactured goods I have never seen such an item, so I was happy to try it out. Especially when being given the opportunity to buy it for a discounted price through another website. So, though this is my first discounted item I've received to give a review. I ask that you take my review seriously and know and trust that it is not skewed for any reason; but instead honest. This item without a questions is ingenious. It is the type of creation that makes me think of the paperclip and the thumbtack.\n\nPros:\nIt holds my tie from going in the toilet, water bowl, my soup, flipping over.. It is what it says it is.... it is a tie holder and it holds your tie back. I was interested to see how it worked and happy that it fit my shirt. I'd assume that it fits all dress shirts in that the openings are not only the size of a button but elongated openings.  The item is light, thin and smooth.  The packet came with 5 and instructions on how to use it. The packaging was substantial and kept the item safe and sound. I like this because it does what a tie clip does, without the pretentiousness of a tie clip. Many of my clients are blue collar, outdoor workers. To wear a tie when meeting them is already a stretch, to wear a tie clip is pushing it.... this will keep my tie in place on those windy days without compromising the way they perceive me and leave them questioning if I find myself to be better than them because I have fancy jewelry on my neck tie.\n\nCons:\nVery few, just that the item has its manufacturers name all over it. This makes for an unsightly sitatuion when the tie does move a little and someone may be looking, then again, I have been focused on it all day so I may be the only one noticing.\n\nSimply, I really like this product. Though, I must be honest it is about as exciting as a collar stay once you get use to it. I can see wearing one of these daily and the benefit would be that I can see having it for a long long time because I cant take off my shirt without noticing it, u nlike a collar stay which too often gets sent to the cleaners never to return.\n\nTo anyone that wears dress shirts or may be planning an outside party (that requires a tie), I'd buy a set.. well worth it.\n\nNow.. on to the disclaimer, and feel free to read my other reviews if you question my integrity...\n\nI received the product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. This is my honest review with no intention to mislead anyone looking to purchase this item. Please feel free to ask more question and I'll be happy to look and provide a response.", "summary": "Intersting little gadget, Anyone that owns a dress shirt and tie should have a set.

I have a husband and four sons who have gone through dozens of expensive ties over the years because a tie tack or bar snagged that one little thread that ran, and they have lost enough tie tacks and bars to start a small jewelry store.  I learned early to keep spares hidden in the car so we would not have ties waving when we arrived at church or special occasions.  I have resorted to using one of my stud earrings on occasion to prevent it.\nThese tie holders are sheer genius.  They hold ties securely, you don't see them floppy in the wind and they lie nice and flat against shirt.  Tfhey are easily attached to the buttons of a dress shirt, and through the little label on a tie. You should make sure this is securely attached to the tie..  I agree with another review that the logo is a little large, but you can't see it behind the tie. I will be ordering more because one of the boys will be running by to borrow a tie tack or bar from Dad. If he's lucky, he will get to keep one.

It takes some dexterity to get the buttons in there.\nTaking a shirt off takes some remembering that this is there (awkward in some situations)\nThe logo is a bit... big and the \"clear\" is a bit shiny.  Both of these take away from the invisible-ness... if this matters to you.

I knew that I had a lot of costume parties that I would be attending and that I wanted to make a bold statement this year. When I finally came across this outrageous costume, I knew that I needed to get it.\n\nThe costume arrived right on the time that it said it would. The package however, looked like it was just put into a bag and then ducted taped and sent out for delivery. It shipped to the correct address without any complications or problems though. When I put on the costume it had 3 draw strings that held the air in; one around the waist, and two around the ankles. The costume then had a fan that could clip right onto your hip that distributed the air throughout the costume. The fan needed four AA batteries that were not included with the package. When I turned on the fan the whole costume was inflated in less than 30 seconds. As I wore the costume around, I had not problems keeping the costume on, and the air seemed to stay in moderately well. You do however, need to keep the fan on at all times while you are wearing the costume. It was a great outfit for walking around and hangout out, but I would not recommend any strenuous activity while wearing the costume because the air will not keep in. Four hours into the night I noticed that the fan was starting to slow down and air was not going into the costume as well as it was when I first turned it on. That is about the time that I had to switch batteries. As soon as I changed the batteries, the fan then continued to circulate the air as normal again.\n\nOverall, my experience with the Unicorn Fancy Dress Costume was a positive. I had no negative experiences with this product and would buy it again in a heartbeat.

It can hold more underneath/behind the main slots.\nFor bills, there is a divider in the bill section, giving it two spots for bills, allowing for better organization of currency.\n\nWhy did I give this wallet four stars instead of five? I ordered the brown wallet. I was slightly disappointed when I opened the package to find that the wallet is more of a burgundy color. This was mentioned in other reviews, but the picture looked completely brown, so I thought they might be wrong. I contacted the wallet manufacturer, and they offered a refund, and informed me that they would be changing the color description for the product.

Your views on that last statement may very but in my opinion, a wallet should be appreciated  by the carrier and totally unremarkable to everyone else, like a guy in a nice suit at a coffee shop.  The stitching is sturdy and the amount of space available is more than adequate.  My one and only gripe is that it is larger than I typically carry but that is most definitely not a negative for the wallet in it and of itself.  It is pure personal preference.

The Genuine Full Grain Leather RFID Blocking Wallet by Secret isn't just like any other wallet, it is very lightweight and feels really premium, yet keeping itself very slim. The build quality is just fantastic, the stitching is on point and it is very precise. The genuine leather build makes it feel much more exclusive and reliable. The wallet has two bifold sections, or LARGE BILL compartments in this case, to place your paper money in, and multiple card holding pockets, 8 as mentioned in the product description. Not to mention the packaging that was quite impressing, highly protective, and very presentable in a black mysterious box! As for the RFID blocking capability, I haven't really been able to test it because I don't have a tool nor do I know any RFID identity stealing machines. So in my overall usage of 6 months, it has sustained the toughest situations and tests a wallet could ever go through! I would give this wallet 5-stars, based on all the points mentioned above such as the build, presentation, and the capabilities of the wallet itself, not the mention the exclusive price point of $15 at the time. Overall, this is a wallet that I would definitely recommend, especially for myself, close relatives, and friends.

His last hat looked like something my great grandfather would have worn to go fishing. It also stunk from the material it was made out of. I decided it was time to replace that hat. I liked the look of this hat, so I placed the order.\n\nThe hat arrived, and was exactly what i was anticipating. It looks like a nice quality hat, but is breathable so it doesn't trap the sweat. The hat I purchased was the standard adult size and black color. The black is not faded or gray looking, but the black that is expected. The white stitching on the hat also is very bold and looks great. The stitching also looks like someone spent lots of time on it. It isn't messy at all. The adjuster on the back also fits snug when it snaps, so you don't have to worry about it coming undone.\n\nOverall, this hat was a great buy for me.

For freezing temperatures I would need something more like those mittens or gloves that warm up.\n\n Saying that, a simple trip to the supermarket can often trigger a Raynaud's attack. So I am always wearing some sort of gloves and I really like the ones that have the tips of the fingers open because they're easier to use - whether it's just holding onto things or when you want to use your devices like cell phones or touch tablets.\n\nThe fingerless gloves I normally wear are warmies - they look similar to these but they are a little heavier and they have a little pocket inside where you can place  little heat packets (you can find them online or in ski or sport shops) where you just rip the packets open, expose them to the air and put them in the pocket. They work well enough but I thought I'd try these because sometimes I find those a little unwieldy and don't always remember to have them around.\n\nThese are actually quite nice- they are thin enough so that you can easily wear them and go about your day. They also help keep my hands warm.\n\nOn the negative side, their thinness and the large openings, especially around the thumb left too much skin open to the elements. That is a problem for me as far as wearing them outside in the cold, but they fine, in fact great for inside.\n\nIf you don't have Raynaud's, and your issue with cold fingers isn't that bad, this might be a 5 star buy for you. But if you need something that truly keeps your hands warm, I am afraid these don't fit the bill.\n\nNote - I am a female with smallish hands and these fit me perfectly. The picture gave me the impression that they went further up my arm but they don't, they really only go just past your wrists but that's actually what is shown in the picture. Just be aware of that.", "summary": "Not so great for those of us with Raynaud's.", "unixReviewTime": 1484265600}

Unfortunately, the gloves did not arrive until just before New Year's because, even though they were listed as Prime, they shipped from China, which took around 2 weeks.\n\nI received the Light Grey, which are a soft heathered dove grey and not nearly as blue as the stock image shows. They are warm, snug, non itchy, and very soft. My hands are average to large, and the gloves stretched to cover my knuckles and wrists. The seams are well finished and flat, with no irritation on the inside.\n\nThey are great for working on the computer at night, after the heat has been turned down, and for reading in bed. I thought I would wear these gloves at home only, but I find myself reaching for them over my normal gloves and mittens. I like having my fingers unencumbered, and if my fingertips feel cold, I can curl them inward and tuck them under the knit edge. I like these so much, I might pick up a few more colors.

Eventually (after a lot of use) I've found that cashmere stops pilling.\n\nUPDATE: I have worn these gloves every day since they arrived.

I usually use another umbrella with a canopy, especially for very windy days and sometimes the wind is still to tough for them. Also, the canopy umbrella is good for two people, sort of golf size but sometimes, these big umbrellas get in the way, a lot when walking in crowds. This particular umbrella fits my bill when I am alone, solo. It is 42 inch and I believe what makes this more windproof is the added ribs. I saw other peoples umbrellas and this one stood out of the pack with I believe it was 10 ribs rather that 8. This is definitely what makes it stronger against the winds. I finally used it and had significant winds and it did not flinch at all. Perfect. The open close feature is great. Opened great but to close was a little more harder, though not a deal breaker. Use close button than in semi-closed position, push the top closed with your hand to handle and its done. You can still close by hand by pulling it close once it has withdrawn to the semi closed position may be a little tough. I bought two of these and I am very happy I did, as its nice to have a spare for when my son visits. This is so far a definite keeper. I highly recommend it especially at this price.

This is definitely not your cheap travel umbrella from the drug store. The material is nice, thick, and sturdy. I've had several travel sized umbrellas and none have have come close. In fact, many times they have flipped with the wind as I was running to my car. It is highly unlikely that this would happen with this particular umbrella because the ribs that hold it are very sturdy and durable. It is not loose and shaky as the rain hits it. I also like that the diameter is much larger than other travel sized umbrellas. My boyfriend always refuses to use his own umbrella but always jumps under mine halfway to our destination. This always annoyed me in the past because, unless I had my large golf sized umbrella, one of us always ended up with a wet back. This particular umbrella covered us both. It wouldn't work with 2 large people but if you're small to medium or if it's you and a child, it works perfectly. The open/close button works perfectly. I like the way it pops when it opens and isn't weak like the others. The handle is also a good size and very comfortable to hold. It has a loop at the end, which I use to hang the umbrella with on my garage door. That way I can let it dry and won't forget it the next time I head out. The only negative, and the reason I didn't give it a perfect rating is that it can be a little difficult to fully push the body down into the shaft and get it to lock into close position. This can be an issue when you're trying to jump in your car quickly and close it without soaking your clothes. It took a few times in the beginning but now I know how much force I need to use.

For this quality umbrella all I want to say in this review is the phrase One and done.  What is this simple yet intriguing phrase this crazy guy is saying one and done you ask?  One and done is the simple catch phrase that describes my philosophy when it comes to buying new items that I plan to actually use to make life easier.  Well at least that is my philosophical goal because it doesn't always happen.  Let me explain.  Whenever possible I try to buy a product that lasts so I just buy it once and I don't have to buy it again.  This Sevitti Umbrella would qualify as a one and done product in my view. In my experience this Sevitti Travel is the perfect most ultimate umbrella for someone who wants quality and usability.  First off it is loaded with quality and it is loaded with nice features.  This thing is robust.  It is super strong. Everything about it is quality.  I remember one time using a cheaper umbrella and a big gust of wind came along and destroyed it.  I really don't think that would happen to this umbrella due to the high quality of its build and materials.  When I first took it out of its package I was like \"wow, cool\".  The really cool thing about this umbrella is the push button open and push button close. I have a 2 year old son and it has been raining allot lately.  When I take my son out to the car in the rain of course I use an umbrella.  The problem with a normal umbrella is that it takes two hands to close it.  With this umbrella all it takes is a push of a button.  When you first start when the umbrella is closed you push the button and it opens completely with no further action on your part.  When you are done and ready to put the umbrella away you just push the same button and it collapse at the top.  You then push the telescoping rod back it its original configuration and then wrap it closed.  I recommend letting it dry out before putting it back in to the little cloth holder thing it is stored in.  The bottom line on this umbrellas it: totally awesome is all I can say.  I expect this product to last for years of regular rainy season use.  I did receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review because I have review allot of products on Amazon and lots of people have found my review to be helpful so I continue to review products that would otherwise not get many under this arrangement or that I am interested in.", "summary": "Nice umberella", "unixReviewTime": 1455321600}

Upon opening, I found the umbrella came with double layered bag the same color as the umbrella (black). The bag appears to be made of the same water-proof material as the umbrella; I preformed a simple water droplet test on both a small section of both the interior and exterior of the bag and found it beaded up rather than soaking in, making this bag a nice bonus for keeping an already used/damp umbrella in your purse or brief case without the risk of getting the contents of your bag damp. The bag is small enough to roll up and stick into you pocket, it does however lacks any sort of hook to help aid in preventing the bag from being misplaced within the bag or while in transit and using the umbrella; but does fit snug enough (two hands required to slide it back into the bag) that is neither difficult to reinsert the umbrella, nor have the bag slide off and expose your bag interior to water.\n\nThe umbrella itself comes with a braided cord handle bolted into the base of the ergonomically shaped and lightly textured grip (sturdy plastic with a matte black finish) - I have rather small hands and experienced no issues with being able to grip the umbrella and have my wrist fitted completely through the loop, however my male roommate while able to slide his hand into the loop did experience some difficulty with removing it, so there is likely to be a slight issue with this part of the product if you have larger sized hands. The fabric of the umbrella is held secure when not in use with a single 3/4-inch/2 cm wide strip with Velcro on the end. The umbrella is operated via a push button in the base for both opening and closing the canopy; the umbrella must be manually pushed back into primed position after closure. The center rod of the umbrella is metal in construction, with a combination of both metal and plastic for the arms of the canopy. The canopy measures at approximately 46 inches/116.8 cm in diameter. The strength of the tension in the support rod requires two hands or a secondary surface to press the umbrella into to collapse it completely (a bonus in Texas' windy weather and often \"sideways\" falling rain). Collapsed, the umbrella is approximately 13 inches/33 cm long with a diameter of 7.5 inches/19cm when placed inside of its carrying bag.\n\nOverall, umbrella has sturdy construction with a very powerful release. It's compact frame makes it easy to squeeze into a backpack or larger sized purse. The wrist strap is a bit on the small size, but doesn't inhibit the use of the umbrella. The carrying bag is a bit of a concern on keeping track of with it lacking any way to keep it paired with the umbrella. While I haven't had a chance to test its mettle out in the infrequent rains, I am looking forward to keeping this in my purse for such an occasion.\n\n**I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.**", "summary": "making this bag a nice bonus for keeping an already used/damp umbrella in your ...", "unixReviewTime": 1453161600}

The 42 inch wide circumference was perfect size. It was small enough to be compact but large enough to cover both my son and I while it was raining. I loved the durable feel of the material and the springs the umbrella had to pop open and close the umbrella quickly and efficiently.

In the listing it says you'll receive a necklace as a \"gift\" but I did not receive one. But I contacted the seller & they assured me that they would ship one out to me. The only complain I have is I didn't receive a tracking number with my order, so I wasn't able to track my order. But I contacted the seller & they were extremely nice & very accommodating. They told me not to worry,that I'd receive my shipment very soon. & I did! Overall, I'll be ordering again & I'll be defintley be recommending to everyone I know.

We went to India in December, and we took this with us.  With airline regulations regarding luggage, it is not practical to have 2 bags if you can possibly STUFF everything in one- and keep it under 50 lbs.  In our case, we had a bag with clothing, and it was very full= and weight just under 50lbs.  However I was concerned about the zippers on the suitcase since they were stretched to the point that they were painful to look at.  Enter the BlueCostco Heavy Duty Long Cross luggage strap.\n\nThis thing IS heavy duty.  Its made out of very heavy nylon- and is sewed very securely anywhere necessary.  The sections slide via a loop on one side, and are adjustable with a buckle on the other- so you can make sure its very tight.  Once its adjusted properly, you can \"sit\" on the suitcase, and buckle this- and it takes all of the stress off the zippers, and transfers it to this.  It also makes it more visible when coming thru baggage claim- since most bags are very similar.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\n1- Removes Stress from suitcase Zippers.\n2- Peace of mind knowing your suitcase won't accidentally get unlatched or pop open.\n3- Makes your bag easily identifiable and visible when coming down baggage claim chute.\n4- Extra places to grab the bag on baggage claim or out of taxi, car rental van, etc.\n5- Extremely well made\n6- Value priced.\n\nDISADVANTAGES:\n\n1- If you have your bag TIGHTLY packed and have to open it at airport- its hard to get it closed again!\n\nYou can see that the advantages clearly outweigh the disadvantages.  I am glad to own this, and I was very happy to have it on our long trip to India.  I highly recommend it for anyone who travels, or is going to travel as bags are very similar, and not always made as well as necessary.  This will help overcome those problems.

But they also easily come out when needed.\n\nRegarding the size, the slimness is good, but I do find the overall dimensions to be just a little too big. I think the length could have been a little big shorter, say 1/4\" (currently 4-1/8\") and also the height (currently 3-1/8\") about 1/4\" smaller too. That would mean spacing the pockets a little closer together, but that would be okay. It would just make the overall footprint smaller and more compact. But that's just my personal preference.

I don't generally keep a ton of cash in it (in fact I mostly use cards) so it always seemed like it was thicker than it should have been. I decided to try this RFID wallet, both because I was interested in slimming down the size of my wallet and also because now with the ubiquitous nature of identify theft, protecting my cards with the RFID feature seemed like a good way to prevent myself from having to deal with the headache of canceling cards and disputing claims (which Ive done 3 times this year after my iPad was breached).\n\nSo far, I am really happy with this wallet. It is very thin - it takes up a small fraction of the space my previous wallet did. True, there isn't a ton of room for lots of cards, but Im able to comfortably keep 10 cards in it with some cash in the middle. Having less space for an excessive amount of cards forced me to re-evaluate their necessity and I realized that quite a few cards Id been carrying around really didn't need to be in there. Honestly, does a person really need more than 10 cards in their wallet?\n\nThis wallet is made of leather and so far seems to be made well; the stitching feels solid and even though Ive only had it a few days, I feel confident that it will last a good while. If not, I will update this review to reflect that.\n\nThis wallet is really great for someone who:\n-Is worried about identity/credit card theft\n-wants a really slim wallet\n-is looking to cut down on the amount of unnecessary junk in their wallet and needs a little motivation\n-doesnt go around with a lot of cash\n-isnt looking to keep change or a condom (or anything else like that) inside the wallet.\n\nUPDATE 9/29/16: I've been using this wallet for close to a year now, and am still just as happy with it. It is showing no signs of wear, the stitching is still in excellent condition, and the compact size prevents me from accumulating the typical 'junk' I used to to stash in previous wallets. I'm very happy that I upgraded from my previous wallet and still highly recommend it.

I have carried a traditional back-pocket wallet all my life, but lately I have taken to removing it from my pocket when I'm driving, because it's just too thick and uncomfortable, especially for longer distances.\n\nBut this slim front-pocket wallet is just what the doctor ordered for everyday carry and travel, too. When I made the transition, I took some time to sort through my cards and other wallet paraphernalia, and I picked out the few items I decided I actually use. It wound up being less than I imagined, so I put those items (2 credit cards, my driver's license and one other identifying document, a little cash, and some toothpicks -don't ask). With those items inside, this wallet is still super comfortable in either my front- or my back-pocket, even when I'm driving.\n\nThere are a few items, like my library card and AAA card, that I don't use very often but I like to have with me, just in case. those items I have taken to just keeping in the console of my car, so they're available when I need them, which isn't often.\n\nSo, I give the wallet five-stars. I really like it, it's extremely well constructed of real leather, very good-looking, and the RFID protection is a bonus. Honestly, for just about any guy, I don't think you can go wrong. I would really like receiving this wallet as a gift, and I think most guys I know would, too.

Although the material feels well-made and sturdy, it is truly meant for that night out and is not practical enough to use every day.  Having said that, this is a nice accessory.  It has four compartments. My LG G3, fits easily in the compartment at the back, the second largest compartment is a good place to put your money, the middle, zip-up compartment would be a good for cosmetics so you can freshen up, and the smallest compartment in the front is where you would put your credit cards and drivers license.\n\nThe clutch bag has a detachable wrist strap which makes it a bit more convenient in a party setting as you can put this over your wrist and have a hand free but while you are holding the clutch bag this way, you are making it easier to steal.  So I would be careful with that.\n\nAnother plus is that the purple color of the clutch bag goes with most things and is not too flashy.\n\nI expect I will be making use of it when my husband and I go to a Thanksgiving or Christmas party.  It is that time of year.  But after that, it will probably go into my closet to wait till its this time of year again.\n\nI expect this is true for many peoplewhich is why the price ($11.99) is a reasonable one.

It was inside a standard plastic rosary case with a sticker on the top of St. Benedict. The way it was shipped caused the case to crack and it's unusable but the rosary was not damaged and I wanted to wear and display mine so it doesn't bother me. In the scheme of things, this was a small error.\n\nI searched high and low not only for a rosary that was aesthetically pleasing but also for one that met a certain price point and that didn't appear to be cheaply made. No matter who makes a rosary, the parts are universal and therefore common. I also wanted one that is wood and steel and therefore not flashy. I've been gifted a few rosaries before and it's such a personal matter that I prefer to choose or make my own.\n\nPATRON SAINT: St. Benedict is the patron saint of everything from monastic life and religious orders to Europe and poison.\n\nQUALITY: The parts used to make the rosary are fair. Overall this is good quality. There were no abnormalities, broken parts, and Jesus didn't fall off the crucifix (something that happened to another reviewer with a different rosary)! The pieces are all double-sided and with decent detailing which are key features especially if you choose to wear it. The length is average and good for that.\n\nIt still feels very lightweight in the hand and the dainty steel chain is something I'll probably replace. This can be done at any local bead store. They sell chain and other fittings for cheap and with a pair of hobby pliers rosaries are inexpensive and easy to make. I just don't have time. Parts used to be made of pewter giving them some weight and durability. Not sure what these are made of. The beads are a nice size. I love the variegated colors of the beads. Nothing has rubbed off on my hands or tarnished.\n\nSUMMARY: So while the container arrived broken, the rosary was fine. It's good quality and at a reasonable price point. I'll purchase from this seller again and recommend this product for prayer, display, and wearing. As for durability, it may not hold up long term being carried around in a pant or coat pocket with other items. \"S\" hooks are used to make rosaries and are notorious for coming apart easily.

I don these palm warmers on and my hands and wrists are toasty warm and my fingers are free to type away.  I really love these gloves!  I was also surprised by the BONUS GIFT of a beaded bracelet!  Love that touch! Thank you!\n\nI feel so ELEGANT wearing these palm warmers, They remind me of the old times, the 1920's or 1930's, when wealthy women wore finger-less gloves so they could show off their elaborate rings.  Poor women wore finger-less gloves so their fingers would remain free to sew or embroider.  Palm warmers are the modern day solution to carrying out simple tasks!\n\nI wore these over the Thanksgiving weekend, with my rigs on and my bracelet (included) over the glove.  This made a real CLASSIC look!  I plan on getting a lot of use out of these palm warmers.\n\nI recommend them to anyone who need their fingers free during tasks!\n\nDisclaimer - I received this item for my honest and unbiased review.

I love them, they fit great and look gorgeous on! My normally don't wear gloves in the winter because I find them uncomfortable and they feel tight when I wear my wedding rings. I can't move my fingers well in traditional gloves and just find them more of a hindrance than I'm willing to deal with. These winter gloves from FuzzyGreen are the perfect solution to keeping my hands warm while having all the flexibility I want. We just had a good cold snap and I put them to the test! While my fingers weren't covered they stayed just as warm as they would have in normal gloves. They stayed in place, no slipping, bunching or movement what so ever. The faux fur is an added bonus in that it offer an extra layer of protection while adding style and beauty. They are cable knit that is soft and warm. They go up past my wrist, a huge plus to me, and continue up my arm to about half way between hand and elbow. The length is fantastic since I have long arms and my wrists never seem to be covered either by my coat or any gloves but these winter gloves solves all that! I am super happy to have these gloves and will be wearing them all winter long! One note: they do take a long time to get here, so if you are ordering for the holidays, I suggest you order now and cross your fingers. This wasn't an issue for me since I tend to order gifts that I know are going to take a while to get here, early. I was provided a sample of the product for my honest unbiased review.

I usually use thinner ties so this was perfect for the job. However I tested it out with a new and thicker tie and it certainly could not pin it down for much time at all.\n\nThis is a small tie bar that serves its purpose well.

Regular sized ties might work, but it won't really secure it in place with this tie clip. If you wanted something for both skinny and fat neck ties, you might check out something else other than this.\n\nThe metal clip looks nice and has a nice finish to it, but it does feel a bit light and cheap. If you were to give this as a gift to wow your significant other, I'm not sure if it'll do that, but is functional and nice to look at. It's a great price compared to what else is out there and works when you're in a bind. I love the simplicity of the design. It can be business casual or formal to match any sort of event ensemble.\n\nI love this tie bar in addition to the way that it was packaged up. It came in such a cute little box that presented it very nicely. The metal is such a beautiful sheen and the sizing is perfect. It looks very nice and the quality is really great. I highly recommend this for any guy looking to up the style factor of his wardrobe with a minimal investment in space and change.\n\nThe clip comes in a cool little box that I'm using to store the clip in so that I don't lose it. What else is there to say? It's a fricken cool tie clip that does its job perfectly!\n\nDespite receiving the sellers discounted price for this item, I rate the product as if purchased for full retail and with the same degree of scrutiny. I personally rely heavily on other customers reviews when making a purchase on Amazon and I take writing my own reviews very seriously. Hence, I take the honest and unbiased aspect of all of my reviews very seriously. I don't hesitate to write a critical review or rate items low when warranted. All opinions and words are 100% my own.

No more cut off arm circulation or looking like I can't decide on a hair style! It does take a little practice to get the hair band on the bracelet, but not that much. And I do have to put the bracelet on my wrist and then the band on the bracelet because of the nature of the cuff styling.

A much less expensive option than the bracelet sold expressly for this purpose.\n\nI also found a DIY solution to make it easier to hold hair bands--you can super glue butterfly earring backs to the ends of the bangle (use needle-nose pliers to tighten the curves on them, if you like), and it creates a \"notch\" to rest the tie in as you slip it on.

Well, AFTER reading all the reviews regarding size I finally picked out the sizes for my fiancee's groomsmen. My fiancee gave me the task to get them with the requirement that it is a good price and it can be a suit they can wear outside the wedding. It Is PERFECT!!! Sizing is pretty spot on too. You just have to make sure you get know the measurements of the man's chest and waist before purchasing. One groomsman has measurements of 45\" Chest and 39\" waist and we got the 46L 40 Waist for him. It fit spot on and was comfortable for him. My fiancee tried on my brother's pants who has a 36\" waist. My fiancee has a 38\" waist though. The pants still fit him but it was not as comfortable as would someone who had a slightly smaller waist. So if your waist measurements are 36\"-37.5\" waist the 42S/L/R and 36\" Waist size would fit you nicely. But a common tip I read was that if you don't have a standard ratio of chest to waist that is used to standardize these suit sizing then make sure you buy the largest of the two sizes. Worked out for me... Well, this is also true for those willing to tailor their suits later so having a slightly larger suit via jacket or pants would be easier to alter than having a smaller size. But for me, I really wanted to buy something I really did not want to do a lot of work on. I apparently will be altering some of the groomsmen suits too by myself so...yeh.... Lots of work for the bride...Anyways, these suits are an amazing choice for people who don't want to fork out hundreds for perfect tailored suits. Just need to hem the pants bottom and DONE! These suits aren't awkward sizing like some I've seen. All the good reviews and ratings for these suits are spot on if not deserving more.

It still looks almost brand new with keys and coins in the same pocket.\n\nApril 2017 ** I just received it but I love it so far. I've been using money clips for maybe 30ish years and this seems like the best so far. The thin and light carbon fiber is the best, that's why I went to money clips so long ago was less weight and less bulk. The gold/black looks sharp but I'm afraid the gloss finish will get scratched up easily but the gold I think will look better than the matte  black.\n\nMy issue has always been, over time the constant open/close of inserting money and removing it wears on the curved part of the clip and breaks there eventually. Time will tell, I'm going for longevity, especially since it's exactly what I want.\n\nSome others have mentioned and complained about the \"S|B SERMAN BRANDS\" logo but on my unit, it's barely noticeable unless in the exact right light SEE PHOTO.\n\nThe only reason for the 4-star rating, and not 5, is the unit was apparently manufactured in lengthy sheets and shaped and cut one by one leaving minor jagged edges, mostly on the inside surface around the unit but still where it will be touched when inserting money and cards back into it.", "summary": "Great money clip", "unixReviewTime": 1491436800}

Take your wallet out of your pocket, look at how bulky it is, then look at the wear and tear it caused to your expensive jeans, then realize that you might as well toss it away after reading this review. Using Serman Brands money clip after one try will have you rethinking how youve been carrying around money your entire life. Honestly, the clip itself is absolutely amazing. Aesthetically and practically. I want to write this review in a way that truly emphasizes how amazing it feels to use this clip. One thing, it can carry more than any other clip because of the quality of the carbon fiber its made with. Were talking about the same quality carbon fiber aircrafts are made with, so you truly know how dependable this clip is. When not in use, there is absolutely no gap in the clips closure. Itll stay like this forever. Thats how high of a quality the carbon fiber this clip is made with actually is. Not only will it close 100% of the way 100% of the time when not in use, but it also will hold more money and cards than almost all money clips available. This clip can hold up to 11 bills and 8 cards at a single time. Ive used metal clips before that couldn't hold half that amount, then if you tried to hold that amount, they wouldnt close the same way ever again. The metal money clips bend outwards and never seal properly after extended use or holding all your money and cards. Thats a definite safety hazard you don't have to worry about with Serman Brands carbon fiber money clip. You feel how the enhanced carbon fiber clip is engineered to hold everything securely for an eternity of use. And it only weighs as much as two quarters, so you cant get any lighter than this clip with the same amazing tension and overall quality. You just cannot beat this clip when it comes to how effective it is. It keeps your money secure, slimmed down, and even protects it from thieves with RFID signal blocking technology. It covers every base you can think of. Its beautiful weaved design not only makes it an effective long lasting and durable clip, it also makes it gorgeous. This is the perfect wallet replacement and gift! Im telling you, youll be so happy you got this money clip. And if you ever have any trouble, its backed by a 100% satisfaction guarantee. You really won't have to worry about being satisfied one bit though. Get yours today and find out for yourself.  Really.\n\nI did get this amazingly useful money clip in exchange for an honest review.  Please get one of these!

On the inside of the mustache part, there is a cloth lining so that your face touches a smooth and comfortable surface, not the knitted material.\n\nBe warned that the hat does arrive with a little bit of an industrial smell. I solved the problem with a couple of dryer sheets. I put one inside the hat and one between the face mask and the hat. Let let it sit for a few days, then remove the dryer sheets and your hat will smell wonderful! For the price you pay, this hat is great. It makes a cute Christmas present.

However, it will definitely take the bite out of the cold.\n\nI love that this is adjustable and fits all sizes.  My husband's head is typically a 2xl while mine is a medium.  We are both able to wear and adjust this to our own specific sizing requirements by pulling on the 2 elastic cords on either side of the opening.  It does cover our noses which is great as well, although in the winter, this will still cause a little bit of sweating between the mouth and nose.\n\nI also love that on me, the bottom of the cover goes down far enough to cover my full neck which can be tucked under a scarf or fully zipped jacket.  It does the same for my husbands big head.\n\nSome of the stitching does show through on the side and is a stark white, so for me, as a perfectionist, it stands out like a sore thumb.  It may not be like this for everyone though and may not stand out for everyone as it does for me.  I would have preferred to see a gray thread to go with a gray fleece.  It doesn't make the hood function any different.

I'll keep them and see if wearing them longer will solve the issue I'm having - mostly because finding a decent pair of black sandals (flats) for work is near impossible.

This is a premium stainless steel quality figaro necklace that is beautiful and well crafted. Also, the nice lobster claw clasp allows you to easily wear or remove the necklace without frustration and with the knowledge that your necklace will remain securely placed around your neck.

It's like, when they designed the sizes, they only accounted for growth in the waist and nowhere else.

Very different from what I was expecting from the colour name and from the product photo, but luckily I like turquoise even better than navy blue so this was actually an unexpected better colour than I thought it would be!\n\n* About the material:\nThe whole top feels like it's made of good quality materials. The exterior feels smooth and soft, and the whole interior is lined with furry material - and this also includes the inside of the sleeves, which makes this whole hoodie really lovely and warming, and thicker and more warming than your average hoodie.\n\n* About the sizing:\nNote the sizing runs a bit small. I ordered the Medium (106cm chest) thinking it should be nice and loose on me (my exact chest measurement is 90cm), and instead I found this was just the right size; so it's probably a good idea to order a size that shows a larger chest size measurement than you think you'll need. The sleeves are just the right length, the top isn't too loose or too tight - just right.\n\n* About the pockets:\nIt has two pockets at just the right height, of just the right depth to comfortably fit your hands into.\n\n* About the quality of the product:\nOverall I was very impressed with the quality of this product, especially in terms of the materials used. The one tiny imperfection was that the plastic end of the zip had some sharp plastic edges but I filed the sharp edges with my nail-file and it's perfect now.\n\n* Overall:\nA really lovely warm hoodie in an unexpectedly nice teal colour.

The medium is a bit roomy but that's how a sweatshirt should fit I think, plus the sleeves are the perfect length on me in the medium (I like sleeves to come down well past my wrist). At first I was pretty happy with this when I tried it on, the bottom band wasn't too tight (a common problem for me as my hips are disproportionately large compared to the rest of my body), length was good, the lining felt cozy and warm (though it did have a slight smell of something not very nice.... but I'm sure that would come out after the first wash), and I like the little \"leather\" details around the strings on the hood. But right before I ripped the tags off and threw it in the wash I tried putting the hood on and to my dismay it was WAY too short! I've never had this happen before, and I wear a LOT of hooded sweaters, so I don't think it's due to my head size. Pic attached so you can sort of see how much the shoulders of the sweater get pulled up when I have the hood on. The hood would need *at least* an extra 3 inches of length, if not more, to be comfortable. When I put the hood on, the entire weight of the sweater gets pulled on my head, since the entire sweater gets pulled off my shoulders, and it would definitely give me a headache after awhile. I actually use the hoods on my sweaters as I find it's the fastest way to warm up/keep warm when it's cold (the reason for buying this sweater) so not being able to use the hood makes this a no-go for me. If you just want a warm zip up sweatshirt and don't have any interest in using the hood, then I would still recommend this (in a size up from your usual size).

For some unknown reason, belts #3 and #4 were shipped without this loop. I contacted the seller and was told that the 2 colors I ordered did not come with a loop.

Buckle comparison to the 5.11 TDU belt, is this buckle makes it easier/quicker to fasten/unfasten due to its clamp design. But on the same accord, due to the clamp design, I could potentially see some issues with wear/tear on the poly-webbing over time, and possibly some slight slippage if the amount of items or weight on the belt gets heavy - but that's why I'd consider this a light to medium duty utility belt.\n\nThe length of this belt (from buckle hinge to webbing end) is 51\". I'm generally wear 38\" waist for comfort. When the belt is comfortably tightened around the pant waist, there's about 9.5\" of belt slack left over, again measured from buckle hinge to webbing end.\n\nRating of 5 for a moderate economic and light duty substitute to the 5.11 TDU belt.", "summary": "from the feel of it - seems like under a moderate direct blow", "unixReviewTime": 1478217600}

This is a gorgeous bead, the cut is very nicely done so the pendant glints/refracts the light at all different angles.  As a necklace this makes for a rather simple piece.  I plan to use it on bracelets - I collect charm beads and the core on this is wide enough to fit over both Pandora and Trollbead style metal bracelets.  The pendant/bead itself is perfectly sized to fit in with charm beads - it's the same height as most Pandora glass, and is slightly wider giving it a fun/fresh chunky look.\n\nThe core on this piece is sterling silver which is what most mid range jewelry items are made out of.  It will eventually benefit from a bit of buffing with a silver cloth, but it has a great shine to it.  The necklace came in a sturdy little jewelry box.  The chain itself was knotted up (I believe someone else had this issue too?) but it only took me a minute or two to get it sorted out - I've suggested to the seller that they package the chain separately to prevent this issue in the future.  Aside from that small issue, I love everything about this piece.  The price is in line with what I pay for similar styles from other brands, so I consider it reasonable.  Two thumbs up for a versatile and lovely little piece.  :)", "summary": "Great sparkle, high quality construction/material", "unixReviewTime": 1475452800}

They are well made sunglasses and they look is fantastic!  My husband just loves them.  With the cat eye slant you automatically look just a little more glamorous and they give you a little sense of mystery too!  The lenses themselves are really nice and not too dark , so people can still see your eyes a little.  They give a Amber glow when you look thru them.  Came with a little soft glass case also.  The Frames are a tortoise shell design and are made of a really sturdy plastic.

Plus, it's noticeably larger than many wallets while still fitting easily into a pants or jacket pocket.\n\nFirst of all, it's called a tri-fold style but it's different than most tri-fold wallets I've seen. Instead of the wallet folding into thirds, it folds in half like a bi-fold wallet. However, inside are two flaps that are held in place with a leather, snap tab. The flaps have 3 window slots for photo IDs and 4 credit card slots.\n\nAdditionally, there are 4 more credit card slots inside, a coin pocket with a snap closure, an additional open pocket, a zippered compartment and a divided folding money pocket, which allows you to keep checks and folding money separate.\n\nThe interior of the wallet is lined.\n\nThe leather is absolutely gorgeous. It's a deep chestnut brown with a waxy finish. This is uncorrected leather, which means you will see the occasional scar, blemish and stretch mark the cow sustained in it's life. I really like uncorrected leather because I think it's more durable and I like the unique markings. It also feels \"broken in\" the minute it arrives. My son loves this because it's not stiff in his pocket. It's the kind of leather that will burnish over time and develop a beautiful, smooth patina.\n\nThere is topstitching inside and out that is perfectly executed and very attractive.\n\nThe \"spine\" of the wallet has an unusual design that allows you to open the folding money area much wider than in most wallets and it makes it easier to slip your money and/or checks in your wallet.\n\nIf you're looking for a generously sized wallet made of real, natural leather, this is a good one to consider.\n\nNOTE: I was given a free sample for review but a positive review was not asked for, promised or implied. (Recent changes on Amazon have made it impossible to turn off the Verified Purchase badge as I used to in the past, unfortunately.)", "summary": "Gorgeous, natural leather", "unixReviewTime": 1448409600}

I love it though and don't think it is too bad size wise, works great in a purse.  Also, the front slot could be used for a pull out ID, but seems better for a small picture instead, due to the button strap on the side to protect credit cards from falling out.
