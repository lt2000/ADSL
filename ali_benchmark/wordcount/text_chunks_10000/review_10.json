I was a little confused at checkout on whether I put the initials I wanted in the right place, so I e-mailed the manufacture and they wrote back that they received my request and verified what I wanted, which automatically put my mind at ease about this purchase.  I ordered two, and they both came earlier than the two weeks, which was great.  I love the size of this.  The sterling silver is shiny and it looks so custom and expensive.  The price was way more affordable than at the boutiques that I originally saw them at.

No matter what rings I looked at, I kept coming back to this one in particular. Amazon had only 3 reviews, and Ebay I couldn't find any for the jewelry-just the seller. I finally went to Berricle and I spent some time overlooking reviews-not on this ring but other jewelry as well. That is how I decided to purchase this ring. Berricle has 22 reviews not just 3 on this ring specifically. I have a very beautiful wedding ring set already but, I wanted somethign more playful and I have always dreamt of having a pear cut ring. This is beautiful!!! This is an affordable and fun alternative when you want to switch it up! There is a tag that is attached to the ring-so do not remove it unless you are *sure* you really want it-if you remove it it will be non-returnable and non-refundable. So, please keep that in mind. It came earlier than expected, I live in Scandinavia and it was estimated to arrive on April 29th. 2014 by 8p.m. and it arrived yesterday, April 9th! It came in a cute little box too! The only downside to ordering FROM Berricle (not Amazon) is that you cannot upload videos or pictures of your purchase and the rings do not come in quarter or half sizes,only whole sizes. I have smaller hands and fingers and I wear a size 5. The ring is smaller than the pictures on here might have you think, in my opinion that is not an entirely bad thing! It is delicate and beautiful and sparkles beautifully! Since, I do have smaller hands I think it looks perfect! If you are looking for really big and flashy this might not be \"it\". I have uploaded some pictures and I sincerely hope that it helps someone make a decision! So far, it's been almost 24hrs and I have washed my hands, done laundry, and tossed stuff into a dryer with no problems. I slept with it on last night and no problems. If there comes a time where something happens I will update! :) **Also, I'm Erik's wife just so there isn't any confusion! :D", "summary": "Beautiful!", "unixReviewTime": 1397088000}

It's not a problem for a young adult or a child, but it makes wearing it for extended periods of time difficult for an adult. I feel like I'm having problems breathing, and my glasses fog up quickly. That makes doing anything other than light walking a challenge, and I usually take it off a few minutes after I put it on. That being said, it's a fantastic novelty item - I walked into my child's daycare with it on and was instantly the start of the show. Helps if you can also sing the Mr. Ed song - because no one can talk to a horse, of course, unless that horse is not a horse at all but rather someone wearing a horse head.

They come in a four pack and have a colored neckline with a sweet little bow.  They are very soft and they hold up very well when washed.

The key difference: I decided to buy a more expensive pair instead of the typical $6 or $10 pants I get.\n\nThe difference is astounding! This isn't a very expensive pair, but the $10 extra really made a difference. These pants are made of a very breathable, soft material that also fit snug against my body without squeezing me. It really flattered my curves, especially my butt! They were also long enough that they didn't look ridiculous on me. The best part: it withstood washing and drying! They didn't shrink or get distorted in any way.\n\nThe only warning is that they ARE very snug pants, so make sure you get the right size. If you are like me and you're kinda in-between two difference sizes (for me, small and medium), you want to go with the bigger size (for me, I got medium).\n\nSo if you're looking for a good pair of yoga pants that are reasonably priced, will hold up in the wash, and will make you look sexy as you work out: these are the pants for you.", "summary": "Accentuates all the right \"assets\"!", "unixReviewTime": 1358726400}

I've tried leather, textured leather, lorica (a water resistant artificial leather) and silicone. Looks and comfort are my main criteria.\n\nLeather is fine, but eventually wears and looks awful. The more 'outdoorsy' you are, the quicker the wear. Lorica lasts longer and comes in colors, but shares the same eventual fate.\n\nThe Zulu bands are initially confusing, i.e. what do all those rings do? Well, you first thread the band through the pins (pins stay attached to the watch). The band is continuous, not in two pieces. If one pin fails, the watch stays attached - very good news if you're kayaking, swimming, jogging, etc. at the time. You get to keep your watch!\n\nAfter you buckle the watch, you thread the tail end through two of the rings for a more secure closure. I'm guessing the two rings on the other side are for looks.\n\nLooks and Comfort - the band works at play and at the office, it traditional. I worried about comfort, but it is comfortable. No metal (even the rings) touches your skin. Not even the back of the watch touches your skin. There are also lots of holes in the band which allow precise buckling - it's not 'a little too loose' or 'a little too tight.'\n\nThe Best for Last - does your watch ever fall over to the bottom of your wrist? Kind of annoying, right? It's never happened once with this band. I have a big dive watch, stainless steel case and need a 22mm band width.

In my opinion, that's to be expected anything that's made from this particular material.\n\nHonestly, I was a bit concerned with the \"one size fits most\" model since my husband has pretty big hands, but the gloves stretched and fit his hands comfortably.

I grabbed my phone to get a pic. Now since we have no children at home this conversation was quite hillourlous. He said why? What you going to do with them? You know the ones. I had to remind him we did in fact have a few grandchildren. These were actually well made. Not like a lot of the headbands you see. They did not break when you put them on. A lot of thes kind just are so brittle they pop first time. These alien boppers were very flexible. These also had 3 good combs built in to help them stay in your hair. These even glow in the dark. I like to order small novelties like these to put into my cheer and good will bags. I make bags of small things people need and pass them out along our travels. I feel everyone needs a laugh or at least a smile. These have put smiles on people's faces. They look in the bag and see pens, paper, hand sanatizer, and then they see the alien boppers and crack up. They immediately put them on and laugh.

It is more of a bonus to me when they are actually a good product.  My 5 and 7 year old absolutely love these headbands.  They are a very simple design. First, as a disclaimer, the picture shows 12 dark headbands.  In reality there were 4 red, 4 blue and 4 green headbands in our package.  That was actually a nice surprise.  Some days the kids like to be twins.  Other days, not so much.  The aliens are placed on springs and attached to the headbands by a plastic prong that comes out of the headband and holds the spring.  The benefit of that is they can't break off.  If a bopper happens to come off, it just fits right over the prong to be reattached.  The headbands are definitely kids size and they have a but of bendability (is that a word) so if the headband flattens you can mold it back into a horseshoe shape.  Yes, a few of mine did arrive with a slight bend in them, but they went back into shape immediately.  These are kids party favors, not a name brand, designer product.  My kids have been wearing the headbands for 5 hours today without saying a thing, so they must be comfortable.  There has been no complaining of pain behind the ears.  Something tells me they may be worn to school tomorrow.  The aliens had a slight glow to them.  Enough to make the kids happy.\n\nThese alien bopper headbands will be a hit at any party or sleepover.  I received the headbands at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  I did not guarantee a positive review and the review is 100% based on my personal experience.", "summary": "Kids are enjoying wearing them", "unixReviewTime": 1452729600}

Baird", "reviewText": "Nice blouse and the material is exactly as it appears in the photo.  A nice polished-type sheen to the fabric and the color matches the photo.  I'm a 36 1/2 - 37\" bust but I ordered the small which says it's a 39 1/2\" bust size on their Size Chart pictured within their Amazon listing for this blouse.  But I have big shoulder muscles and I don't like a too-tight fit so this was just right and the fit was not too tight and not too loose.  I also ordered another of these blouses in the Tan, however, that one arrived in a very different color and a totally different fabric!  The color of the Tan one that I received was a very dark, dull brown color with a yellowish cast to it and the fabric was much stiffer and coarser.  It was totally different than the Grey one in both the color and the fabric quality.  This blouse is non-iron, but remember that, like most non-iron blouses, that means you get it out of the dryer immediately and don't let it sit in there once the dryer has stopped.  I found that if I take it out before it's too dry, it doesn't need ironing at all.  Also, I noticed that these two blouses, (one in grey and one in Tan), were actually made in two different countries.  The Grey blouse was made in Honduras and the Brown one was made in Bangladesh so that may be why the big differences.  I wish I could get this blouse in the correct Tan color as it pictured in the photos AND in the same, smoother fabric of which the Grey one is made.  The Seller was very good about handling this problem, communicating with me, and refunding the money for the Tan blouse.  If I could order the Tan one and be certain it was the correct color and fabric, possibly that it was also made in Honduras, I might try ordering it again, but alas, the Seller gave me no information about how to get the Tan blouse in the correct color and fabric as it is shown in the photos. And I REALLY WANT that Tan one!  Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to buy this Grey one, or any of the other colors you like.  This Seller is very good at communication and customer service.", "summary": "Very nice Blouse.

The charm itself is really shiny and looks great in a light, and does look better in person than it does in the picture--it isn't flat, like the picture shows. Also, the color is a darker blue, more of a sapphire than a teal. (I'm not sure if it's supposed to be that way, as I can't find any screenshots of Asuna WEARING the necklace, nor have I seen the anime yet, so I'm not sure if it's accurate or not.)\nThe box also differs from the one shown--it shows a different picture, and is held together by a magnet. It's actually a bit nicer than what's shown, and would actually be great to store the necklace forever in. It's not really cheap looking.\nThe only REAL problem was that the pendant snapped right off the part that attaches it to the necklace as soon as I lifted it up off to see how it looks in the light. Nothing some glue or some wire can't fix, but it's just something that I think people interested in the necklace should be aware of.

Well, I don't know enough about Alloy metal, but the silver didn't last at all. It turned more of a copper color all over as the shoe slowly turned from a pretty silver to an ugly copper. I didn't know how rugged and rough it looked after it turned a copper color, so I gave it to a kid friend of mine who loves shoes too for her to pin onto her backpack.

They did not move down my foot at all and I never got any blisters. I also remember thinking that these sock feel amazing, but they are thin and will not hold up. Well...several years later I still have a few pairs of them left so I was wrong. Yes, you can see some wear in them and some of the their brothers and sisters have been retired so it was time for new workout socks. I tried a few other highly rated socks, but they were tight or just didn't fit well. So, I decided to go back with the brand that worked before. I could not remember the exact style I got before (name long gone and general look has changed) so I thought I would give the Enduro 2 Low Cut a try. Man...I love them. Same great fit and no sliding at all. Yes, $11 for a pair will make some people cringe, but once you try them you will understand why you paid that. Besides, you are on your feet so much of your life. Make sure they get the best. Also, if they last half as long as my originals it is so worth it.", "summary": "Balega is still amazing", "unixReviewTime": 1411862400}

I had a single compartment pouch I used for years. It had been washed many times, but was old. I found a LeSportsac that fit my needs (a smaller one) and I love it and got one for my daughter too. Now, this one is much bigger. I wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for something small. It depends what you need it for. I have to say, LeSportsac is not cheap, but they do last. Love them.

I'm worried about this happening in Europe, particularly in Ireland where they have a reputation for auto break-ins.  My idea is to lock all the suitcases to each other.  So, if the thief gets the trunk open, he can't just grab a bag or two and run off.  This retractable cable looks like it will be perfect for that.  It's relatively small, and lighter than I expected.  It's not burglar-proof because a thief could cut the cable, or cut through the handles of the suitcases.  Theoretically, he could drag all the bags out of there attached to each other.  However, the point is just to make the job difficult enough that the thief moves on to the next target instead.  I think this will do the job nicely.\n\nLike I said, it's lighter and smaller than expected, which is great.  And it's very easy to use.  Even setting the custom combination was easy.

A soft leather feel yet stands on its own.  I ordered beige and the color was exactly that.  This purse is more than a purse, it is a travel organizer with eye catching style from the inside out.  The straps (handles) are rolled and very comfortable on my shoulder.  There is more detail to this handbag than most purses I have owned.  There are 4 zippers: one on the outer back side approximately 6 1/2\", one on the inside back wall approximately 6\",  one dividing the inside center of the purse approximately 12 1/4\" and the zipper that fully encloses this purse for security is approximately 17 1/2\".  They all work perfectly showing no signs of stress.  There are two front wall inside open pockets that are side by side one is 4\" wide and the other is 3 \".  The 4\" pocket holds my Altoids mint container perfectly.  I thought this fact might be helpful in giving a visual as to its size.  The stitching of this purse is perfect.  As for organizational purposes, this is the best I have ever owned.  I would order again in a heartbeat from the Sori collection with out hesitation.  I was at my local post office when this package arrived and yes I opened it there.  There were several ladies present at this time and I wasn't even the first to hold it because of its appearance it was snatched up and examined by the others first.

Dealing with Luxottica Consumer Warranty and Repairs that handles Ray Ban's customer service is very difficult and extremely frustrating. I initially contacted them via email so I can include pictures(attached to this review) of the defective part along with my request for a replacement. It took a few back and forth emails before I realized it was pointless because I was only getting a computer generated generic response so I decided to call their toll free number. I provided the rep with the case / incident number as stated on the emails so she can understand what my concerns were and see the pictures for herself. I explained to her that I understood their policy for claiming warranty. However, given the fact that these were my son's prescription glasses and he had no spare to use while they conduct their warranty claim investigation that could take up to 6 weeks, I was hoping they will recognize the obvious defect of the part, simply send me the replacement and spare me the cost of sending them the glasses, take the risk of losing them in the mail or the lens sustaining damages that they stated they will not be responsible for and more importantly, my son not having the glasses he needs in order to see well! Instead, the rep reiterated the same generic response I got from the email giving me the option to either go through the entire warranty claim process or purchase the part to replace the factory defective one at a ridiculous price. I thanked the rep for her time and expressed my sentiments towards this particular Ray Ban product and their policy for warranty claims. My family and I all wear Ray Ban both as prescription glasses and sunglasses and have always been pleased with its quality with the exemption of this model. This was our very first contact with their customer service and it is unfortunate that the experience did not turn out the way I was expecting from a prestigious company such as Ray Ban whom I have been a big fan of for decades.", "summary": "Terrible quality, worse customer service for warranty requests", "unixReviewTime": 1442448000}

Big and deep, decent extra interior spots for Advil, sugars, bandages, etc. Nice size exterior zip areas and the holster pouch is a really good size. The .38 fits holster and all. The other side holds my speed loaders easily. I can put in the center pouch my large wallet, likely a book, couple kid diapers (if I were at that point, trying to give size ideas),  water bottle..all easy! I was also very pleased with the quality of the leather. I know some folks prefer super soft thin stuff, but this is more solid. The strap is a good length and wide so it won't bite your shoulder and stays there. I'll likely be buying the brown one too because it is a good fit. Lining is decent too...most I've seen pull out, not cool if you have a serious reason to quick draw. Not so sure about that little locking doodad.

I mean it's not a big area and can't be used for much, with that being said after I had the purse for maybe 2 months it had came unsewn on one side of the inside of that pocket making everything that I put in it go inside the lining of the purse, and once again it's not a big area so I was always losing whatever I put in it.

This has the qualities and more. It's right or left hand draw which is an advantage. The leather is very high quality. It shows no wear after a couple of months of use. The leather looks brand new and the hardware has not tarnished. I like the hobo design which makes it easy to find things in the bag. You can fit a medium to compact size firearm in the concealed area. Full size Glocks or S & W's will print. The included pocket holster allows for perfect placement and anchors snugly to velcro in the concealed area. It anchors so snugly that you will probably have to use the \"wrap the holster in paper\" method to position the holster to your desired location. Locking zippers on both sides provide some security when you need to secure your firearm temporarily. The wide shoulder band helps with the carry weight and I like clip my keys with a carabiner to the strap to allow me to zip the purse and keep my keys accessible.\nThe price is very reasonable for this type of purse.

They both were delivered and, surprise, I like this one the best.\n\nHere are the pros:\n\n1) It is a shoulder strap - and although it is not adjustable, it is thick, sturdy and a great length for throwing it over a shoulder and going\n2) It has two internal pockets - one large enough for my iPhone WITH the OtterBox case (which makes it pretty thick!). One that is a bit larger than that - perfect for keys, a medication bottle, etc. and a zipper pocket on the opposite inside wall of the main compartment.\n3) It has a zipper pocket on each side of the purse - and an additional pocket that is easy to slip things in quickly.\n4) The leather seems good quality, the zippers are heavy and appear to be good quality\n5) The pocket for the gun is large enough to carry my S&W SP101 .357 revolver or my Taurus Millenium .45 or even my small Glock 45.\n6) The gun does NOT show through as in a lot of the other concealed carry purses I've seen. Unless you know what you're looking for, you'd never guess it had a gun compartment.\n7) The gun compartment zipper locks - it's not going to keep out a thief determined to take your stuff, but it would definitely stymie a curious child, which was my concern with grandchildren.\n\nThe cons (and some of these won't be cons for you!):\n\n1) I couldn't find it in anything but black on amazon and black just is NOT my favorite color. I'd have rather had an earthy color - dark brown, olive green, etc. But, I still love the purse.\n2) It comes with 2 keys when an awful lot of these purses come with 4. I tend to lose things - regularly - so 2 more keys would have been great, but obviously not a deal-breaker.\n3) It is for a right-handed person. There's many CC purses that have access to the gun on both sides so it can be right- or left-handed. (and, honestly, access on both sides would be great because who knows how the purse would be sitting when you may need the gun). I do wish they'd change this purse so it had dual access.\n4) The interior of the purse is undivided and, although it's not small, I'd not mind if it were a tad bigger. I can easily fit a full-sized checkbook wallet, some makeup, keys, etc., but, my purses tend to do double duty as tote bags half the time, so a little larger would be nice. Don't misunderstand, it's deep and a lot fits - I'm just being picky!\n\nAll in all, a great buy - I hope they decide to add some color choices though - I'd buy another in a heartbeat!", "summary": "I like it a lot more than I thought I would!", "unixReviewTime": 1380153600}

I looked all over for a cute, functional, easy to access conceal carry purse that wasn't crazy expensive. This one is PERFECT. Much better than I expected. It is genuine leather and very good quality.  It's very roomy! The main pocket is big enough to put just about anything I would want to carry. The front has two pockets--the zippered one, and then just below it opens as well so you can just slide your phone in there without having to unzip zippers.  My favorite function is the concealment compartment. I carry a .45 Springfield XDS and it fits great in there. The velcro holds the holster tight in place and the compartment would fit a much better gun...the compartment goes from one end of the purse to the other--but doesn't interfere with any of the other compartments.  It's easy to get to to draw your weapon and the zipper even locks in case you are somewhere where you need that function. The only complaint that I have is that the little fabric holster that comes with the gun and velcros into the concealment compartment isn't very functional. My gun is so heavy that even with the enclosed elastic strap it just didn't feel very secure--plus I have a grip safety and I didn't like that elastic strap pushing that down constantly. I have an inside the waistband PJ holster that  I slide into the fabric holster and then attached it to the inside of the purse. The clip on my IWB holster held it firmly to the fabric holster and it won't move or come out, even with multiple draws.

It's classy and stylish and well-made. The hemline is well-done (which is not the case with other Allerga-K items), including a nice decorative hem at the back. It's surely far from the quality of, say Talbots or Ann Taylor, but it's about 10 times cheaper, so this is to be expected. The colour is just as shown (I ordered the light beige one). Overall, I could not belive it that this blouse and the 3-4 other items I'd ordered were from the same company - this one is much better quality. The only thing I am not crazy about this blouse the sleeve length - they seem a bit short for my taste (I prefer them to the first thumb knuckle and these just reach my wrists). The blouse itself is a nice length - much below the waist, so I've no idea why the sleeves aren't longer. But, overall, I like it so much that I'm ordering it in black, as well.\n\nSo, if you're wondering whether to order this blouse, I'd highly recommend it. I would not recommend, however, ordering from Allegra-K in general (i.e. items with no reviews) as there seems to be a great variation in the quality of their products, so you really don't know what to expect.\n\nOne thing to consider if you decide to buy it: I wear the US size XS/S (158 cm/56 kg or 5'2'' /123 lb) and this blouse fits perfectly.\n\nAnd one more thing: you should not expect any care tags or textile content - this is something Allegra-K never cares to add.", "summary": "Very good quality blouse", "unixReviewTime": 1365638400}

I usually wear a small and ordered a medium and it fits almost perfectly. I think that I could have gone with a small but the bust in a small may have been just a tiny bit too tight so I think that the medium was the right choice. I have already received  many compliments on this shirt as it is unique and unlike anything you see in the stores. It looks just like the picture and it goes with anything! I noticed that a lot of other reviewers complained about the sleeves being short but I think that they don't understand that a bracelet sleeved shirt is supposed to fit that way. Bracelet sleeves are supposed to hit just above the wrists. So, the sleeves are not too short - they are bracelet sleeves.\n\nAnyway, this product is great and the seller is great. I have purchased four Allegra K shirts and have been happy with each and every single one. For the price, you simply cannot beat it and the designs and styles are unlike anything you will find in the store. Take a chance and try a top but make sure you pay attention to their sizing notes!

I got compliments on it already. I usually wear a medium, and a medium fit me perfectly. It is a pretty warm dress, so it's great for winter use. The material is fairly thin even though it is warm, so it is very comfortable and light. I was not completely sure about it when I ordered it, but it exceeded my expectations. It looked kind of short in the picture, but it is long enough for me (I'm 5'5\"), even with a bigger chest (34DD).\n\nThe collar might not lay flat once you put it on, but once I've put it down, it stays flat for me at least. The collar was a little wrinkly when I got it, but after one wash, it looked a lot better. I've put it in the washer and dryer (both with heat), and had no issues. It follows your curves, but is forgiving on the stomach area for me, and doesn't make me conscious about my post-pregnancy belly like most other tight tops.\n\nThe only slightly negative thing about it is that it is a tiny bit itchy. I'm very sensitive to wool and itchy fabrics, so it might not be an issue for others.

They look AMAZING on her...the perfect FM booties. She kept them on for a while, walking around our home and breaking them in, getting comfortable. Now, these OBVIOUSLY are not the shoes you're going to wear walking around the city in, and even dancing in them might be a bit much after awhile, but they're perfect for sexy bedroom wear.

Johnson", "reviewText": "I got this about a week ago and I haven't taken it off since. It is so soft, cute, comfortable and beautiful, I have even slept in it because it is so cozy and comforting on these cold winter nights. I ordered the black and white husky hood at the same time and I love it just as much, when I got them my boyfriend put on the koala hood and promptly fell asleep in it and then wouldn't give it back for two days because it was so cozy. I am very pleasantly surprised and I plan to order more types of colors and animals. The paw prints on this one look perfectly cut and placed as opposed to another one from another brand which looks like a first-grader made it. The fur on this is stunning, it looks real and feels extremely soft and the color looks just like the photo. The lining is a soft velvety, velour-like material as opposed to the ugly fleece on my other one, the olive green color looks just like the photo. Inside the paws is lined with the velour material rather than the fur. The hand pockets are just the right size for me to fit my entire hand without having to make a fist. The little zipper pocket is a nice addition. I really like the button under the chin, it's a nice looking button and it fits securely in the loop closure.

I found that the headphones that came with the S3 were pretty amazing in my opinion, but I noticed a few things that could be improved upon. When the S4 came out, my headphones from the S3 had just died and so I went online and found that the S4 had different headphones than the S3, and I immediately noticed the tangle-free design, which is something that I had been wanting from the headphones that came with the S3! However, I mostly wanted to hear all the sounds coming from the song, whether it be the highs, the lows, or the mids, I wanted to hear every detail possible when listening to anything. I read the specs on these headphones and I was ELATED to find that they were functional with the S3, and that they had added a few things that would have the potential of giving me the full sound that I craved when listening to music. I took a chance on buying a pair, considering the fact that they were $5 and they had good reviews, so I felt pretty safe with this choice. The gamble paid off, because from the first second that I used them, I was absolutely blown away at what I heard. Everything i had been looking for was right there! Ever since that first pair, i have bought nothing but these headphones. I use headphones all the time, whether it be like right now as I write this review, or when I have to go and do yard work. They usually last a few months for me for each pair, which is great considering the fact that I use them CONSTANTLY. I would recommend these for any android user and anyone with Samsung gear, they are amazing!", "summary": "Love these headphones!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1406160000}

Lockwood", "reviewText": "After various plain umbrellas \"disappeared\" we decided a patriotic-themed umbrella might do better. We searched for \"American-made\" but this is Chinese-made. Furled and retracted, it looks like a 15\" baton with a dark blue handle, and the braided nylon loop (looks a bit like parachute cord) is secure. The wrap-tab that holds the umbrella furled has a hook and loop instead of a snap closure. It's easier, but just be sure you \"furl\" clockwise.  We hate umbrellas that aren't well-secured to the ribs. Good news:  Some thought seems to have gone into the way the fabric is attached. The low profile auto-open button on the handle works the way it is supposed to, and the mechanism seems sound, with no unpleasantly sharp edges or anything that might pinch.  Like a lot of automatics, you should furl the umbrella tightly first, then push it down from the top into the handle to close.  The handle has a raised lip that secures the rib tips if you want to make sure nothing snags when you carry the umbrella in something like a tote or shopper.  We are more likely to cram it into a handy spot in the car -- same diff.  We've heard rumors the included nylon sleeve is intended to keep a wet umbrella from transferring wetness.  This one has a split hemmed opening to make it easier to take off/on, if you are the sort who uses them and doesn't lose them. (Personally, I told my wife the cat's either very patriotic, or has \"issues.\")", "summary": "Not American-made, but nice anyway", "unixReviewTime": 1369094400}

The Seiko SSB025 is an outstanding chronograph from the standpoint of styling, value and functionality. Unlike a conventional quartz chronograph (where the chronograph hand moves from second to second), the 6t63 meca-quartz movement provides a 'sweep second' motion on the tachymeter at 1/5th second increments ensuring far more accurate readings. Plus the pushers offer the feel and function of a far more expensive mechanical chronograph due to the mechanical linkage.\n\nLuminosity of the dial markers and hands is outstanding. Whether 'charged' by sunlight or flashlight, you will get 5+ hours of readable illumination during darkness and/or sleeping hours.\n\nThe 'Fulfillment' factor at Amazon (where they actually have the item in their stateside warehouses) guarantees an expedient delivery time (4-5 days via regular USPS shipping within the U.S.). Lastly, if you haven't opened or applied for an Amazon/Chase Visa, consider the option as you will receive $50.00 off your first-time purchase at Amazon.\n\nThis was my first-time Amazon purchase and everything worked out well.

I've always wanted a chronograph but was put off from buying because:\n\n- Quality mechanical chronographs are prohibitively expensive. I prefer mechanical over quartz.\n- mechanical chronographs are usually very thick\n- quartz chronographs can only measure down to the second, so they are not as precise.\n\nThis watch, for the most part, takes care of all these shortcomings. The somewhat large case diameter but low profile chronograph still manages to look good on my tiny 6 1/4inch wrists. Despite being primarily a quartz watch, the chronograph can measure down to 1/5th of a second and has a spring back reset just like a mechanical watch. And best of all, it is the same price as a regular quartz chronograph watch (relative to other Seikos) and the quality is very good like with other Seikos in this price point.  Keep in mind that this is the same Seiko movement found in $300-900 dollar watches from \"boutique\" brands (see autodromo prototipo, Belmoto, Straton curve).\n\nThere were only a few minor cons that i've found:\n\n- The bracelet feels cheap and light weight. End links are hollow instead of solid. To be expected at this price point. I immediately replaced it with a standard leather strap.\n- The second hand (middle one on the bottom) doesn't exactly line up with the markers. The second hand still has the typical 1 beat per second movement like almost every other quartz watch, so don't expect mechanical like sweeps for this part of the dial.\n- When you reset the stopwatch time, I can see the minute hand move slightly. This doesn't seem to affect time accuracy however.", "summary": "The accuracy of a quartz coupled with the feel of a mechanical chronograph.", "unixReviewTime": 1462579200}

I took them to a local jeweler, who confirmed the color and clarity. To the eye, these diamonds are very nice looking. Under a lens, there is obviously black streaks in the diamonds, which is why they are graded as they are. The diamonds are .95 carat and worth approximately $800 - $900 according to the jeweler. He then showed me an identical pair at .92 carats, with same color and much better clarity. The list price on those were $1450 but he would sell them for $850. By comparing the diamonds side by side, you can see the better clarity diamonds have more \"fire\" and are more reflective since they have better clarity.

I wear one almost everyday and am always looking to add a good polo to my collection. From crappy Walmart polos, all the way to Tommy Hilfiger and Ralph Lauren, I own every grade of polo, and this polo held up.\n\nThe polo itself is comprised of 100% cotton. It has a nice soft feel to it, but not too soft, as it has a good balance between softness and roughness so that it doesn't shrink too much. The collar is a little thin for my taste. It's not any sturdier than the material of the polo so it doesn't stand up too well by itself. This is a minor annoyance for me, but for such a cheap polo you really can't expect any more.\n\nThe sizing is good. When it first came I put it on and it was way to big. However after one was, a little bit of shrinkage occurred (it is cotton) and it actually shrank to exactly where I wanted to it. The polo is a little bit on the \"fatter\" side, meaning that it's long, but it's also wide. It's built for wider people which may be a good or bad thing based on your preference. Overall the sizing is good though.\n\nThis polo is good. Especially when you look at the price. I have found almost no flaws in it and I'll probably be adding it to my daily wear collection of polos.\n\nNote: I received a discount in order to honestly review this product.", "summary": "Good Quality Polo for a Good Price", "unixReviewTime": 1436313600}

I normally wear yellow gold or  sterling exclusively.  I wanted a change, and I wanted something that was very versatile that could be worn with most any attire.

Hold them up next to yellow or even white gold, and you will definitely know that they are indeed rose gold.\n\nIn contradiction of some other reviews, I found the posts are long enough that they should fit most any size ear lobe. Maybe if someone has a rather thick lobe, these might be of a questionable length.  They are 8mm long, and that is only 1mm shorter than my more expensive diamond ones.  The backs are small and can be a bit tricky to hold onto, but are easily manageable.  They are just under 5mm diameter, and most of my other earring backs are 6-7mm diameter.  If you lose one, it might be hard to find.  I frequently sleep in my earrings, and the burden of a cpap mask with straps that move around during the night.  I have yet had one of these ear beauties come loose. They do stay put once they are placed on the post; however,  I think I will invest in some larger rose gold backs!\n\nThe balls  have a lovely shine and look great with the 4mm ones if you have dual piercings on each ear.

It kind of irks me that I'll have to be constantly worried about it while wearing these earrings based on what happened with a different pair.  But if they look good, that's a risk I'm willing to take just because I love rose gold.

The concept was cool, and it does what it's supposed to do; tell the time and have a silhouette of Hatsune Miku on it. There are also other logos you can choose if you don't like Hatsune Miku, like the logo for Attack on Titan. I chose this because at the time, I was really getting into Hatsune Miku's voice and decided that it would be a moderately okay idea to buy some merch, then I stumbled across this. It comes in a nice little box, however I don't know if it will be the same for everybody, looking at the differences between my box and the one on the Amazon page as I'm typing this. It also comes with a manual that is, thankfully, translated into English, hilariously broken as well. I only have two complaints with the product itself. First, a minor problem, I never find a nice adjustment where it's not too tight to leave any sort of marks, but not too loose where it just flies to one side to the other. It's kind of hard to describe the what I mean by that, but it's not that big of a problem anyways. The other problem, which is a major problem for me, is that it can come apart somewhat easily. I can't tell you how many times the bottom strap came off when on my bus and I just caught it at the last second before getting off the bus. I am always paranoid by stuff like that because I feel like it will come off at one point and I'll loose it forever. I'd say don't buy it because of that reason, but considering how much I paid for it, the cool box designs, and the amazing manual that you will laugh at once or twice, I'd say it's worth having if your a fan of Hatsune Miku.", "summary": "It's OK!", "unixReviewTime": 1418601600}

I had a coupon saved up which means that I ended up paying less than two dollars for it.\n\nWhen it arrived, it was in a brown, Amazon box, inside it had one big, bubble wrap and then the smaller, L watch box. The box has a bright yellow silk cloth, I simply followed the directions that a few of the reviewers gave, clicking the side button for a few seconds, it will blink on the hour number, then I clicked it until it had the time, while doing that, on the minute side it will show P or A which is to tell you if its \"PM as in Night and Evening.\" And \"AM for morning.\" I've put this since I don't know if other people who don't use that system are buying this product.\n\nAnyways, after that, I waited a few seconds then clicked on it twice, quickly until the minute side began to blink and simply went until I had the correct minutes, I left it alone and the correct time showed itself.\n\nI love how the time comes, when you slide it open, it looks like a small mirror with the word 'Death Note'  at the bottom, the time starts to flash and looks like a bunch of 8's than it turns to whatever time was put. It may not be water proof but it has survived me accidentally washing the dishes with it or getting it wet through other ways, all it does is that it stays showing the time for a few minutes then it goes back to normal, but I advice that if it does get wet, to quickly dry it off just in case.\n\nI love the black rubber band that makes the bracelet part of the watch, personally, I have extremely sensitive skin and usually get rashes from things like Gold, Silver and other stuff because some chemicals are sometimes added. I have very tiny wrist, as small as a child since I am pretty petite and my hands are tiny, what I love is that it gets small enough for someone like me to wear it and big enough for someone like my brother, who is much bigger then me and whose wrist is much bigger, to be able to wear it comfortably.  It also doesn't look rough on me, as if its too big or too small, its something that can be worn no matter what and I am planning on buying more of it.\n\nSorry this review was so long, but I hope it did answered a lot of the questions, also this took me if I remember correctly, two days to arrive, I believe this was with the Amazon Prime, and yes, it did look just like the image.\n\nIf there is any questions, I don't mind answering it.", "summary": "Perfect L watch.", "unixReviewTime": 1432425600}

The Amazon price is fairly low for a good backpack, and this one is certainly a quality product.\nThe main pocket features a laptop compartment large enough for a mid size laptop, and plenty of storage space for books, notebooks, clothing, or whatever you could need to carry.\nThe pocket in the top corner is perfect for phones, phone chargers, spare inhalers or medication, a deck of cards, or other small things you may want to carry with you. It even has slots in which you can store pens and pencils.\nThe front pocket can store anything between the other two pocket sizes. I personally use it to store a book or a CD or two, depending on the day.\nThe material is sturdy and durable, and does not seem to degrade quickly. The adjustable straps offer plenty of room to slip your arms into, and the pack is easily large enough to fit the needs of any high school or college student.\nOverall, an excellent buy, and I am very happy with this product.\n\nUPDATE\nI've been using this backpack for the past two years and it's still good as new!

Mine arrived within three weeks, not several months, and yes, it did come all the way from China. This product is exactly like the much more expensive silk scarves you'll find in art museum gift shops, just without the fancy packaging.  (Mine came wrapped in a simple cellophane bag.)  The colors are rich and vibrant, and the quality is excellent. It drapes beautifully, and looks great with cashmere turtlenecks, especially as contrast against light colors, like pale turquoise.  (I normally can't wear aqua or pale turquoise, but this scarf adds plenty of bright/rich blue near my face, so I can actually pull it off.). Just don't expect to wear it against dark blues or greens;  the colors will completely blend in. As you can tell, I couldn't be happier with my purchase.

I bought two pairs of large because that's the size that I wear in ExOfficio and truly I can't imagine who would have a large enough waist and skinny enough leg for these to fit even close to correctly.

Anyways I received my order 2 weeks from the day. I wear a small so I ordered a medium. It fits fine being a 32C+. The title says sheer and it is. No weird smell like some others have gotten. Not sure what material the shirt itself is made out of since the label does not say. My only issue is the red parts ( collar & pocket), the material is shiny (not silk like but stiff) and THAT is what makes the shirt look cheap. Otherwise it looks the same as the picture. If you look closely, the model is wearing a tank underneath giving the material of the shirt a thicker look", "summary": "Not sure what all the complaints is about", "unixReviewTime": 1380758400}
