First, on my unit, the waist strap was sewn on incorrectly so that the strap has a permanent twist to it (like a twisted bra strap). In other words, the clasp was sewn on backwards so to wear this, you will have a permanent twist to the strap, which is very uncomfortable. Because of the twist, I couldn't really keep this on for an extended period of time because the twist irritated my skin. The fabric is quilted but also a little textured, which might also become an irritant. If you can wear it over a tee shirt or other undergarment, that would be optimal.\n\nThe one really nice thing about this belt is that it's a neutral color and it holds enough. It's really just meant for the important items you don't want pickpocketed while on a vacation. It has two individual pockets that are big enough to hold the essentials. And herein lies the second problem  the quilting. While the quilting makes this attractive, it adds considerable bulk underneath clothing. I'd rather have a little more room in the pockets for important items than bulky quilting bulging from under my clothing.\n\nWhat I plan to do is to dissemble the strap and fix the twist and re-sew it back together. Then I'll just use it as a fanny pack type of thing for outdoor activities when I just need a pouch to hold my phone and keys and a credit card.\n\nThe idea for this is nice but the execution and price are a bit off.\n\nI received a free or low-cost sample in exchange for my honest opinion.

I have three binders. They fit into this bag, very snuggly. One of them actually can't fit all the way to the bottom, it's a very tight fit. This makes trying to use the front pocket pretty much impossible. The two side pockets are still usable. It does not fit all of my things unless I take out the Weight Watchers. Doing that prevents me from using it as a purse. I wouldn't recommend this for a child who has a lot of school supplies to carry around with them each day.

I recommend wetting it down with alcohol and spending 30 min twisting, scrunching, kneading etc. to make it move with you when you wear it. Also, make sure to stretch the holsters width-wise so you can pull your \"guns\" out quickly and actually get them back in without looking. Sells the costume much better. Lastly, the buckle was too shiny for my taste, so I sanded it a bit and dotted in some grey paint with a sponge to make it look more worn.\n\nOne note on sizing - I'm tiny (5'2\") and 115lbs. The distance from belt to thigh wasn't bad, and the belt wasn't too long for me, but the straps around the thighs were almost too small for me! And I'm, like I said, TINY. So you may need to size up.\n\nOverall, turned out great. Even won my office costume contest!", "summary": "OK quality, but great customer service and fast delivery!", "unixReviewTime": 1454284800}

There is a lot of extra fabric (I'm 5'7\", 36C, and this is a medium I'm wearing in the video). I got the right size by their chart, but it is kind of big (I'm contemplating another color, but getting it a size down to see if that changes anything in 'form'.\n\nThe video review shows me in it. Not too flattering of a shirt, but I have gotten compliments and I REALLY like the material and how it feels.

I cut a slit in the inside of the cuff & put elastic in it to make them tighter in the cuff & stay up.

First of all, the sodalite plugs are GORGEOUS!!!!!! The picture does not do them justice. They're the black/blue ones in the photo and they're actually a lighter blue with some white/tan streaks, there is no black in them. There are color variations which is to be expected and personally, I think that just makes them more beautiful. The hematite and white jade also look GREAT.\n\nI wear 7/16\" and the Mystic Metal stone plugs appear to be just a tiny smidge smaller than these other 7/16\" stone plugs I own, but the sizing was really close. Overall, I am really happy with them and I will be ordering from Mystic Metals again in the future. I highly recommend them!\n\nUPDATE Oct 2017: I recently started wearing my sodalite plugs again, I didn't wear them too much because they're just a smidge smaller than my other plugs but they usually do stay in. Today, one fell out and chipped  I scraped at the chip with my nail and it just crumbled more pieces right off. Sadly I will be no longer wearing the sodalite plugs. I think Ive only worn these one for a total of like, 7 days since I got em?\n\nAlso, my white jade plugs has drastically discolored. It happened shortly after I got em and like the sodalite plugs, I didn't wear them too often. One is more white while the other is clear. It bothers me a little but at least these ones aren't chipped.", "summary": "Beautiful!", "unixReviewTime": 1446508800}

I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.\n\n**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them.

They really should make chains longer on all jewelry because in my opinion, 16 inches is the size for a child's neck. Or maybe I just have a fat neck, haha. I also was not aware that the actual charm on this was not much bigger than the width of my finger. It is well made as far as the charm but they really could improve the necklace part itself. I will buy and extender and will wear this necklace for sure.

The black bag reads, \"Silver Phantom Jewelry.\" It is thin and small, as pictured in the photos in the item description. The backside of the charm is stamped \"925\" and \"Silver Phantom.\" There is a 3 inch extender on the end of the necklace for wearing at different lengths. I prefer the shorter length but could see the benefit in the extender for other wearers. Besides the aesthetic, my favorite part of the necklace is that the charm is anchored to the chain on each side. There is nothing worse than the lobster claw clasp wiggling itself down to the same side as the charm, but that is not an issue with this necklace. I would definitely recommend this necklace to others.\n\nDisclosure: I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest feedback.", "summary": "Delicate, unique EKG heartbeat necklace", "unixReviewTime": 1455062400}

So for her early 25th birthday present, I bought her this caffeine molecule necklace. And its perfect!\n\nWhat a smart idea! I never imagined how coffee could be incorporated into jewelry design. This is a conversation piece. She wears it around the office and got comments on it. More like questions, like, what is that? A turtle? She got laughs all around. And yes the pendant is small enough to be non-obtrusive so it can be worn around the office or with other casual clothing. The chain struck me as rather thin. Chains like this are very popular with ladies because it is more effeminate. The nice thing about this particular chain is that the caffeine pendant is quite small, so the thin chain matches it well and does not overshadow it. The not so good thing about thin chains though, is that they are very prone to being tangled and it is crazy difficult to untangle. The other thing is that the spring clasp is pretty small and it is difficult to put it on or take it off. That's not the fault of this seller, but the nature of this kind of chain. But I want to make sure people are aware of it.\n\nI found out that Silver Phantom Jewelry (the seller) is not the only company selling this caffeine molecule necklace. However, the ones that are cheaper than this one are not sterling silver, and the other sterling silver ones are more expensive than this one. So this is in the sweet spot - precious metal at the lowest price! I strongly prefer the rhodium plating that this item has, because sterling silver seems to always tarnish after the girlfriend has worn it for a short time.\n\nLastly, I want to point out that even though this pendant likes sort of spiky, the ends are all rounded off and are not stabby, nor does it cause any discomfort. If there is one thing I wish they would improve on, it would be to find a way to place a gemstone in the hexagon in the center, which would dramatically improve the visual appeal of the pendant. (Silver Phantom Jewelry, are you listening?)\n\nI am not an easy customer to please. Just last week I gave out a 1-star to a product that I received a discount on, and 2 stars to two other products. I also received a discount for this product and agreed to provide my unbiased opinion in this review. I have no obligation or inclination to give this product a favorable review, so please know that the above review represents my honest opinion of this product.

It has a nice shine to it and reflects light at different angles, which makes it look like I paid at least $30 bucks for it.  I've even slept with it on without any problems of the chain breaking or getting snagged in my hair. Excellent!  Lengthwise, it looks pretty classy with my v-neck and scoopneck shirts, also when paired with a nice dress. It could also be accessorized with a polo shirt and pocket protector to really get that geek vibe flowing!  Heck yes. I wouldn't recommend wearing it with a t-shirt as it probably wouldn't show above the collar, or if you have an unusually massive neck, like Bigfoot, I doubt it would fit. I received this product at a discount for my honest review, and I think this is a high quality necklace that will last and be cherished for all eternity.\n\nSide note - So far nobody has commented or asked me questions about this necklace when I'm wearing it, even my own family. My hypothesis is that they are assuming it looks like a sideways person or maybe even a constellation of a turtle, but most likely it's because I'm surrounded by boring people who just don't care...

My teen daughters don't like it as much as the silk one, but I think it is just as comfortable on me and a great price as a 2 pack.  I know you are, in theory, supposed to use these hidden under your clothes.  If you use it to take money in and out during the day, a thief could see it.  However, the odds of that seem slim to me so I intend to use it like a purse or fanny pack and hold money, credit cards, metro card, other tickets and phone.

We like to go on cruises and some of the countries we visit are in some pretty undeveloped countries with great scenery and nice beaches.  Many times there are peddlers of goods that hound you.  I wanted one of these wallets to wear under our clothing so I could keep more cash on me but not have it be obvious when I look into my wallet to bargain with vendors.  If vendors see $ on you they are not as willing to come down on price.  If you show them all I have is x dollars they usually will accept it.  So this is perfect.  I can have the money I need and keep it concealed.  Safety is also a concern so you don't want to show to much money as you can be a target for robbery.  When we go ashore I take our passports with us.  Do not want to have an issue reboarding the ship and the passport is the best form of ID.  Plus we need to carry credit cards on us.  That is all of our most valuable forms of identification on me.  Having the bag guard against losing our credit card and passport information through electronic theft is a real bonus.  Love that these have credit card holding pockets in the zippered pocket closest to your skin.  You also have a small outside pocket for other items.  It keeps them tucked away from the other items in the pocket.  The sizes of the two pockets are good size to put bills in without the need to fold them.  I do plan to wear this under my clothing.  It is super comfortable and light weight.  Wish I could say I was at ideal weight but nope not there.  This is still comfortable as it has a elastic belt to it that is adjustable.  The belt is soft without sharp edges.  I love the fact that the clasp rests against the front of the fabric not rubbing against skin.  The back of the wallet has a soft weave type of material which feels very comfortable.  It stays in place and doesn't move even when using the rest room. My only regret is I didn't get it sooner. They also warranty the item for a year and seem willing to make any issues right.  That is a real bonus. I do not hesitate to recommend this product.  I have looked at them for a while and the price is great for a wallet with so many great features. I am not an Amazon company affiliate.

This sweater is no different.  I ordered the 'brown' which sports a (beautiful) brown / blue weave and beige zipper area and shoulder / breast patch.  These two areas, zipper length and shoulder / breast, are suede (looks like a more plastic material in pictures) and I was happily surprised.  Sleeves come out to the wrist, not up over the hand.  Very, very warm.  The fit is somewhat small from my experience...I am 6'7\", 255 lb, 52\" chest, 38\" waist and usually wear XLT sweaters...ordered XXL here and the fit is perfect.  It does come down low on the hips and stays tight all the way.  Pockets seem to be of good material, but with this fitting fairly tight, objects in your pocket would look out of place in my opinion.  Zipper is a very good, strong, durable zipper.\n\nI only have two complaints, both very trivial that, if known beforehand, would not have affected my buying this sweater.  The hood is small, fits a bit tighter than I expected when worn over my head (material on the inside is nice and warm, however).  The other very minor thing, the zippers (1 main zipper, one per pocket) are a bit tacky as they say \"Fashion\" on them.  There is a mechanism to switch out zipper handles so this is really a non-issue.\n\nExcellent sweater, excellent quality, nice and warm, very comfortable.

The only problem is that it's very small and easy to lose, also it's hard to match together if you do not own a your own organizational jewelry box and have them bunched up in the zip lock bag it came with.\n\nHaving 55 types to choose from is nice especially if you like to switch it up everyday instead of sticking to one piercing all the time.\n\nOverall good set of body jewelry, keep in mind that they may be on the small side and may be easy to lose if you don't have an organizational tool to store them in.\n\n I received this product at a discount in exchange for a honest review", "summary": "Nice Variety Pack", "unixReviewTime": 1456099200}

This simple but effective tool is great for removing the pins that hold watch band links together.  The pins are typically very small and very firmly set.  To use this, simply place the watch band on the base, align the pin punch screw press with the pin hole (adjusting for the height of the watch band by using the adjustment dial set into the base), then dial in the pin punch press.  The pin can then be easily removed.  Replacement works the same way, only using the second press which has a flat surface to push the pin back in.\nThis tool is nice and solid with precision fit parts, works very well, and comes with 2 extra pin press attachments.

Usually, getting a watch band size involves a trip to the jewelry store or kiosk, or trying to jerry rig something at home. Not anymore!\n\nThe BABAN Metal Watch Band Holder Link Pin Remover Base Strap Bracelet Adjust Repair Tool makes it a lot easier to accomplish at home. In the interest of full disclosure, I happen to know someone who works at one of those jewelry kiosks, so I asked for some assistance with figuring this tool out. My helper does advise watching a video on the Tube to help figure out how to size your watch. I was fortunate to have hands-on help.\n\nThe BABAN Metal Watch Band Holder Link Pin Remover Base Strap Bracelet Adjust Repair Tool essentially pushes the pins out of watch links, and then pushes them back in again to set the link in place.\n\nHow to use:\n- unscrew the knob with the pin pusher needle, until it is wide enough to fit your watchband\n- if necessary, adjust the height of your watchband so it lines up with the pin pusher needed by using the disks in the base of the tool\n- line the pin up with the pin pusher needle > this is also the side with the slit in the side to allow the pin to be pushed through\n- secure the band in place with the flat arm\n- slowly twist the knob until the pin slowly pushes out the other side\n- remove the watch from the sizer\n- pull the pin from the link with pliers (not included)\n- rinse and repeat, as needed\n- to put pins in place, set watch back in the sizer\n- place the pin to be pushed back in place in front of the flat arm\n\nPros:\n- metal > will last longer than plastic\n- includes two (2) replacement pins\n- easy to use\n\nCons:\n- ZERO instructions\n- pliers to pull pins are not included\n- takes a bit longer than using hammering tools\n- may not fit wide band watches\n\nWith my helpers assistance, I am confident I can size my watch or any watch added to the spouses growing collection. I rated this product four (4) stars because it did not include instructions, and it did not include pliers to remove the pins.

Not sure if its cause I have long lases or what but it touches my lower lid and lashes. Also, looking down is not comfortable and it obstructs sight while doing so. I'm thinking I may need to use lash glue or something to keep it in place the night of the party. It actually feels more comfortable worn upside down, but then it pushes down my nose tip and is ultimately upside down. I will keep it since I'm running low on time and may embellish it a bit.

Love the variety of colors and it's nice that there are two of each in case you lose one or you have both nostrils pierced. I ordered these just to switch up my usual clear jewel nose stud so I haven't left them in for extend periods of time like other users and therefore haven't noticed any flaking or fading of the colored coatings. They can be a bit entertaining to put in because you do have to go from inside your nose out, but I've noticed that if I just put my finger on the outside of the piercing hole, the ring usually finds its way through pretty easily. Other reviewers mentioned that they feel this rings are a larger size than a traditional piercing however I didn't experience any noticeable discomfort when I put the ring in, though my nose was every so slightly sore by the end of the day so it could be from a size difference or just the fact that I had a round ring in a straight hole :)\n\nMy only (slight) complaint with these is that the ring ends right at the inside edge of my nostril so most folks who are shorter than I am (which at 5'10\" is a fair amount of people) can see the end of the ring if they care to pay close enough attention. I found that because of this, it was a bit easier to accidentally push the ring out a little if I rubbed my nose and actually got it caught on my sweatshirt at one point when I tried to take it off. But, I figure with all you're getting, it's well worth the price!

There are a couple issues....but I love it :D!!! Let's get my issues with it out of the way. I really wish that this had better straps. Mostly because this thing is pretty big but if you load it with anything too heavy it is going to seriously hurt your shoulders. If you just put mostly light stuff in it than it will be perfect. Let's get this straight. This is like a typical drawstring bag. This is not something you would want to use as a back pack for school unless you are in like...kidnergarten. I do love the fact that they still did what a lot of drawstring bags do and made the straps what closes and opens the bag, regardless of it not being strings. I really like that. Also, don't be fooled by it's size. There is a zipper that, though at first unnoticed by me, when unzipped extends the bag. I really like that feature because then you can either have it huge or small depending on what you are putting in it. The pocket on the front is nice too. Again. Due to the straps I wouldn't put too much in these for fear of your shoulders, but if you want to divide stuff up a bit the front pocket is great to put things in that you need to have access to more readily. The bag is not fabric, it is more of a nylong type material. Lastly the clouds. I love them. They are perfect and look just like the ones on the robes. They also feel like they are really part of the bag, so I do not see them peeling or anything like that.\n\nAll in all it is a really fabulous bag and I can't wait to start wearing it around. I need to replace carrying my purse since I had my son. I tend to just throw things in his diaper bag because I didn't want to carry him, a diaper bag, and a purse. Having this as a purse would take out the carrying struggle factor of carrying a purse again. Though if you do want to carry it as a purse, it has handles on top to carry it as so :).  A great addition for any Naruto fan!\n\nI recieved this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. If for any reason my opinion of the product should change.

So naturally they were going to need some links put in or taken out.  However, my old pin removal tool had gone missing and I was in deep need of a new one!\n\nSo once this one arrived I was really excited and ready to use it, however, once I looked at the pin pusher, it was a little crooked and not straight!  When you would screw in the screw the small pin pusher would be spinning all over the place because it was really off.  So after some minor bending of the tip back to a normal state it worked great!!!\n\nYou simply put your watch on top of this tool, crew the pusher until almost pushing your pin, (most watches have an arrow to indicate which way the pin goes) and the make sure you're aligned perfectly and screw about one full rotations and you will see the pin pop straight out!  Its self explanatory but works wonders!\n\nWithin 5 minutes I have all 9 groomsmen watches fitting them perfectly!  I recommend because its small and useful!!!\n\nClick YES if this review was helpful.  If you have a question, leave a comment and I'll answer you!  Feedback helps me improve my review!

I have many of these kinds of tools.  Most of them are plastic or cheaply made metal and most of them are just about useless.  This is a one piece chunk of aluminum, milled out to give you what you see  It operates very smoothly and easily.  Most of these kinds of tools are for convenience.  These will remove the pins that would be easily removed in other ways.  This is not going to remove/replace every pin, nor is it going to remove pins that do not line up exactly with the tool.  Those will need block of wood and hammer/punch, or a very expensive bergeon tool designed to remove pins.\n\nHOWEVER- if you have a new watch, like a seiko, invicta, or something similar, and need to remove a link or two, this will accomplish the job without damage to your watch band or watch\n\nI would HIGHLY recommend this over those with the \"bolt\" at the end to adjust the height of the band.  They are useless because the part that pushes the pin out hits that \"bolt\" before it hits the pin.  Just use something like this---line up the pin--(and when you look at the band--you might see an arrow- that tells you the direction that the pin should be pushed out)===line it up, use something under it if necessary to raise it a little, and slowly turn the knob to move the tool into the pin.  If you encounter significant resistance, or the pin is not moving==do not continue.  Remove the band and see what the issue is, perhaps the tool is not lined up in the hole (where the pin is) or that pin is not designed to be pushed out--some are little screws---  So try it, and if it works, GREAT!!! It most likely will.  If it doesn't, take it to someone with more experience so you do not ruin your watchband or watch---or break the tool.\n\nGOOD LUCK.  Just go slow, and make sure of what you are doing, and you should do just fine.

Now that I have this little tool I can remove a link and put the band back together in much less time. Maybe about 5 minutes. One improvement I can see is to have different size pins available.

Although many people were unable to tell what the necklace was until they looked at it closer.

If you look closely at the photo, you can see the sections:  head and upper neck, lower neck and shoulders/arms, top  portion of ribcage, lower ribcage and gut area, hips/legs, and then there are 5 tail pieces.  The metal that the skeleton is made from appears to be solid brass.  It is not the really shiny brass (think: gold wannabe), but a more muted one, although there is definitely shine to it.  The chain is either steel or plated steel, since it sticks to the magnet on the back of my phone.\n\nOn the clasp, there is a small disk dangling that says Jane on top and Stone on the bottom, and on the center of the back is a small crystal, that sparkles like a diamond (although I am sure it is not), which is a very nice effect.\n\nThe item name says that it is a choker, which made me nervous, because those often feel like they're actually trying to choke you.  This is actually a necklace.  It measures roughly 20-22 inches to the first jump ring, and 22-24 inches to the second jump ring, so the length depends on which one you select.  (Unfortunately, I don't have a tape measure, I used ceiling tiles to estimate a measurement).\n\nI ordered this for my granddaughter, but I like it so much that I may order another for myself.\n\nI purchased this necklace at a reduced price in exchange for writing an unbiased review of this product, which is what I have given.", "summary": "Cute dinosaur necklace suitable for adults", "unixReviewTime": 1459728000}

Amazon said they'd cancel my order if it didn't ship in a certain amount of time, but most of the wait on the dress is its production, so I knew the long period before shipping was  to be expected. I emailed the vendor and asked if they could contact Amazon and ensure a valid transaction. They were very friendly and said it would come, and it did!\n\nI'm 5'6\", 130lbs, a 34B bra, and waist 27\". I bought a size 4 and it couldn't have fit more perfectly! Both my parents were floored by how custom it looked! And the tulle wasn't too poofy or too long for me at all. No alterations needed there :)\n\nThis has a lower waistline than I expected, which I think looks a little frumpy, but my sisters say it looks fine. It's not a slimming dress, but a pretty shape nonetheless. The lace is very pretty and true to the photo, but very itchy. I'll definitely have to figure out a remedy for that before spending a night in it at prom - maybe a full lining of softer material. I ordered mine in pink, which is shown as a warm blush color, but mine was just a little more fuchsia. (Not nearly as much as the photos look, they don't do it justice. It really is close to the hue of the pink dress shown.) I love that the buttons on the back are fake so I can just zip it up, but upon opening the package, it didn't sit quite right and you can see the zipper underneath. May have to put a hook-and-eye on the back to close that up. As far as the neckline, the front of mine looked like the photo, but it didn't dip down in the back like that. The back was as high as the front on mine. But in the other photo reviews, it looks like one girl's came with a sweetheart neckline! So you have to be up for a bargain with the neckline and the back!\n\nIt's a gorgeous dress, EXACTLY my size, and I feel like a princess in it! For $65, it was definitely worth it.

The wheels are working great and the handle hasn't come apart or pulled completely off of the bag (both of these areas seem to be an issue with many rolling bags). The zippers normally cooperate although they are starting to stick. The straps are still attached and in working order. Now for the not so good. The entire outer area fabric has frayed at the seams. It's literally falling apart. Same inside. The lining came apart about 6 months after purchase. Sad to see this happening, because this is a handy rolling bag that I use for the short trip from my car to my desk at work & back again at the end of the day. It's been extremely convenient to not have to carry multiple bags on my shoulders. If you use this item for an occasional trip out of town (like maybe 4 times a year) it should last you a good while, but it isn't hardy enough for a 5-day work week.\n\nOriginal review: I got this (in the zebra pattern) to use for work because I tore my rotator cuff and didn't want to make it worse by lugging around a bag filled with lunch & water bottles, along with a purse too. I can easily fit my insulated lunch bag and my purse inside this rolling bag. I keep my phone, electronic ID, and sunglasses in the smaller side pocket so they are readily available. The wheels are fairly quiet which is nice when I'm rolling down the hallways at work. I took one star off because the bag tends to tip when going around tight corners, which then yanks on my arm & shoulder which causes pain where I have my injury. Takes some getting used to, but I'll eventually get the \"turn radius\" figured out and not have that problem in the future.", "summary": "Pretty decent rolling bag -- See Updated Review", "unixReviewTime": 1469664000}

It cannot stand up on its own and falls face-down on whatever floor you are near.  (Not very appetizing in airport bathrooms...) It also means that you can start rolling the bag and have a 50/50 chance of pulling it along the floor on the side without wheels.  The second issue I had was that the mouth is not wide enough.  It doesn't zip around the periphery of the luggage, so it is difficult to incorporate larger items.  I'm sure there are applications where this bag is perfect.  It is well made and nice looking.

It is always my luck that on a regular belt I use the same hole and that part starts to tear become weak and eventually break or becomes so thin I give up on it before it breaks at the worst time. This Marino belt is very nice in many areas, the ratcheting system being the most unique. Instead of a traditional latch system the leather has a tooth and notch system that slides through the buckle and holds on. You can adjust the belt in tiny increments by pulling it through until it feels tight enough. This is a great improvement over the traditional. Also there are no holes in the belt so it looks great, too. There are an assortment of buckles and colors to choose from, too.\n\nSo far in using it I have one complaint. I find it difficult to undo the latch on the buckle to open the belt. I keep fighting with it as I find it unnatural to release the latch. I haven't become used to the opening method yet. I push and pull in the wrong direction all the time. I know over time I'll get used to it but it is a confusing, to me, system. When I do get it right it releases just fine. I've never found myself trapped as I read in other reviews before I bought this. I thought that wouldn't happen to me. Well, it happens but not to the point I felt like cutting the belt off. So, I still like it over all. The quality is top notch and the packaging makes for a great gift. The inclusion of a key fob is a very nice touch, too.

The fact is, this bag is quite flimsy and it does not stand up on its own without being propped up against something.  This is an issue because the plastic hook meant for hanging the bag is rather small and won't fit around a thicker towel bar or a door handle.  If you can't hang it up because of the tiny hook it has, then it is not really a hanging toiletry bag.  The zippers do not have a nice quality feel and are not the easiest to use.  They are very jerky due to the flimsiness of the bag.  When you load up the bag it doesn't keep its shape and this adds to the zippers being difficult.  To be a great bag it would need a more solid structure, better zippers and a bigger hook not made of plastic.

I bought my first pair on sale at walmart about 5 years ago and since then I've literally never bought another pair of regular jeans. People think of them as the crocs of pants, but screw that! Nobody can ever tell I'm wearing \"pajamas.\" They look exactly like regular jeans, only they're more flattering because they don't cause muffin top. They're more comfortable, although I've never really felt compelled to try to sleep in them. To me they still are firmly in the \"pant\" category.\n\nI bought this black pair To wear to my retail job and they've worked perfectly and are lasting just as well as my regular denim pajama jeans. The only issue I've found with these is the size difference in the petite pants. I'm usually an XL which is usually for around a size 18-20. They do come pretty snug on me (as I'm closer to a size 20) but they usually loosen up toward the end of the day or the second day. These were the right length for my short legs, but they were also a little bit tighter than I was used to. I think that's probably normal for petite items, but it was kind of frustrating for me, especially since they didn't have a 1x in petite.\n\nWe ended up purchasing another one in a 1x so I can wear that size while I'm losing weight.", "summary": "A little smaller than I expected (but still Pajama Jeans, so still awesome.)", "unixReviewTime": 1463443200}

Biggest issue is the waistline/ drawstring and my personal jury is still somewhat out on that.  My waist measurement is only about 5 inches less than hips so I first tried using these without tying the drawstring, had to keep pulling them up each time I rose.  With the drawstring tied somewhat loosely they do tend to stay up yet I don't actually have to untie them to pull them down, so I'm pleased with that.  I guess the issue is drawstring versus all elastic.  Since Ive had both styles, or rather elastic in back, I must say that the drawstring seems to work a bit better than elastic in terms of keep the pants from sliding down while remaining comfy.  I think a combination of button and elastic might be the best but so far I've not had any like that.\n\nWhile these look like denim they aren't very rugged, so not ideal for work/ garden.  I've had comfort jeans that were more suitable for rugged activities.  These are better suited to lounging or everyday stuff.  But I doubt you'd find anything more rugged with similar comfort in this price range  a pretty good value.\n\nI'm 5'4 with long torso, shorter legs, so always need Petite size pants  length on these is perfect for me.\n\nGiven those caveats, I'm happy with my purchase.", "summary": "Definitely comfy once drawstring is adjusted right; not very rugged, as \"Pajama\" suggests", "unixReviewTime": 1514851200}

I don't really use the drawstring and they stay up just fine. The rest of the \"jeans\" stretches a ton so they do give a little more than I'd like by the time the day is over, but I don't find them to stretch out to the point where they're unflattering.

The first (too big) pair I have been wearing for a year or so - baggy is fine for lounging around, and I have actually worn them out and about, to the grocery store for instance. The second pair (\"medium\") is useless, but maybe I will lose weight or find someone to give them to.

OK, it's a joke.  The gloves are perfect.  They are warm, cozy, light, easy to carry in the pocket (not too bulky) and have a pleasant color.

Two people wanted to know where I purchased this poncho (and of course, I obliged by giving them the link to Amazon's site) and others commended me on how it looks. The BEST compliment was, of course, from my husband who stated, \"Wow! WOW! You look so beautiful! I love the way that poncho looks on you!\" I couldn't be happier. As well, this is a small company- which I didn't realize until Friday night when I read their email. I was so touched by the email to follow-up as well as the customer service. They seem to really care about putting out a good quality product as well as pleasing their customers and this speaks to me.\n\nI will absolutely be looking for more from this company as I couldn't be happier. I had purchased 2-other ponchos in the past and neither of them were of the quality that this one is nor the price. As well, the varied lines on this poncho make it fun to wear.

I do understand now about what another reviewer mentioned about the crotch being too small.  They were kinda awkward to move around in when I first put them on, but after holding onto the waist band and doing lots of squats and kicking out to the sides looking like a maniac, everything was stretched in the crotch area and way more comfortable.  As for the slits in the leggings, hey are super cute and they look great on.  I tried them with my converse and with heels and they look great both ways, so the versatility is great too.  Other than the length and the odd crotch fit, they are awesome and both of those things were remedied easily for me and for the price, you can't really except them to be perfect.  Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and feel comfortable recommending this to others.

The emblem on the skirt isn't on the front, it's on the side, almost at the middle of my hip and you can clearly see the stitching line in the front of the skirt as the pattern wasn't matched up and from what I could read it says \"Ertsh Colege\" lol. Tie and collar are fine, though collar fabric is flimsy so it doesn't stand up like in photo, tie does say \"Police\" or \"POUCE\", my husband pointed out lol.

I am going to sew velcro on for my use bc how fun is doing a 2\" safety pin when you are playing lol.\n\nThe tie had a applique that was random lol.

This is a gorgeous piece of costume jewelry and the amount of labor required to cast and plate the body (yes- PLATE- I will get to that), and cut and set the stones, is worth quite a bit more than twenty bucks.\n\n\"Topaz simulated diamond 10k gold filled\" with a picture of a blue center stone. Any reasonable person will take that to mean that blue stone is topaz, the side stones are CZ or equivalent, and the body is solid low-karat white gold.\nThe center stone MAY in fact be topaz; I am not qualified to call that one, but it certainly isn't the color shown in the pictures. It is very nicely cut for a piece in this price range, and shows some color refraction in daylight.\nThe side stones are for the most part perfectly acceptable, but two that are set in the crown actually have a golden color that once I noticed it, I see at a glance. Again... TWENTY BUCKS. I'm not heartbroken.\nHere's why I'm so annoyed. Why can't some Amazon sellers just be honest and say exactly what it is we are buying?\nThe ad makes it sound like solid cheap white gold. It has a stamp inside the band that says \"10K\" very clearly. A stamp like that should never, but often does, appear on items with a base metal center. The seller responded to a question by saying 'it's white copper', which is commonly referred to as cupronickel, It's an ideal material for coins and silverware and certainly finds its way into plenty of costume jewellery. That would have been a reasonable material to make a ring like this out of.\nI did a quick test on the inside of the ring using a drop of high concentration Nitric acid. If the material were cupronickel, it would have fizzed and turned greenish blue. NOTHING. Well color me surprised, this ring is in fact gold plated.\nI scratched through the plating on the inside, having by now decided not to return it because it's so nice looking, and the center is also not 'white copper'. It's plain red copper. A nitric acid test fizzed up and the second picture is of the blue color on a lab wipe. They could have used cupronickel inside, which would have been better as the plating wore off so as not to be so obvious.\nNEVER wear this ring to the beach or in any environment where it will be exposed to abrasives.\nMy last complaint is that I attempted to cancel my order 20 minutes after placing it, and got a message TWO DAYS LATER that it was being shipped. Really?!\n\nOkay now for the good stuff. I ordered this ring to wear with my stainless Invicta watch and the styles complement each other well. The ring is bright and looks and feels much more solid than your average costume jewellery. It IS extremely well put together, even if the material description is questionable. I have a stainless steel ring on order to wear to work, since this one DEFINITELY won't last long at a machine shop, but it will be a fabulous weekend ring.", "summary": "Five stars for beautiful product turn into two stars for misleading description!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1454025600}

Id also like to note that the customer service provided by the company who makes these pants, Poshsquare, is absolutely above and beyond exceptional.

My first impression was this wallet/money clip was made with quality materials.  You could both see and feel it, and it is no wonder since each wallet is handcrafted with top grade fine calfskin leather. I really love the slim, lightweight, sleek look of this wallet and the fact that the magnet works to hold your cash in place. I honestly would only say 5-7 bills tops to be safe definitely not 18 as described, the magnet was not able to hold all that securely. It has two slots for cards, one is clear for say a drivers license. It is suitable for up to 4 cards. A con is that the magnet is somewhat worrisome with its potential affect on the credit cards.\nIt is nice when you do not want to carry a big wallet just something to bring your drivers license, ATM/debit card, health insurance cards and some cash.  It is very slim and can fit in either your front or back pocket with no bulkiness as it is only 0.43\" The great  feature is obviously the RFID Blocking technology which securely protects yours your cards and identity.  This is a nice added piece of mind.  While we know nothing is 100% everything is worth the chance to reduce the risk associated with high tech pick-pocketers.\n\nAll in all this is a very nice money clip/wallet,well made and very nice looking.  However, it cannot hold much and I am not so sure about the magnet with the cards.

First the good stuff: it's small, sturdy, well made, and pretty elegant. I simply love the idea of using a slim little wallet like this for a credit card, an ID, and some cash. Most of the time, I feel like that's all I really need with me.\n\nBut the problems are with the use of the magnet. It's both too weak to effectively hold much cash, and I'm not at all crazy about the idea of putting a magnet near my credit cards. In fact, this wallet seems like a good way to lose money: if your cash doesn't fall off while using the magnet clip, the magnet will wipe out your credit cards. So that is a problem from my perspective.\n\nWith all that said, I've chosen 3 stars because \"it's okay.\" Yes, this is an okay little clip/wallet hybrid that certainly can come in handy for days when 1) I only have a small amount of cash, like 2 bills on me, and 2) I'm not carrying a credit card.\n\nI received this item as a free sample.

But do you know where I got MY credit card information stolen from? (Of course you don't...that's why I am going to tell you). :) At a concert! At the Palace of Auburn Hills...where the Detroit Pistons play! Someone STOLE my info and signed me up for THREE online dating sites! When hubby got a call from the bank, he obviously had a fit thinking I was cheating on him! YIKES! LOL Anyway, after doing some research and calling the bank etc, I was able to contact the 3 online dating services and I tried to get the info of the person who had used MY name and card. THIS is what I got from them all: \"I'm sorry. We cannot give out that personal information!\" I said \"They STOLE my identification and used my credit card illegally!\" \"Sorry, ma'am, there is nothing we can do but cancel this account and refund your money\". WOW!!!!! Can you believe that? Protecting the thieves' privacy. Interesting. Needless to say, I no longer go to any concerts, amusement parks, large venues etc, without something like this. This is perfect for any types of trips and the multiple zippers will stop at least the very basic pick pocket. If somebody is THAT good, they will find a way to get to you no matter what.

The magnet is very strong and clasps nicely.  My son just turned 12, and for his birthday everybody gave him money and gift cards.  Usually they lay all over the floor of his room, so this was perfect for him.  And because it is a magnet, it will keep him occupied for hours!  HA....OK....maybe a slight exaggeration, but seriously, the kid loves to play with magnets!  LOL\nThe new credit cards have a small chip in them that stores your personal information . These RDIF protectors etc are designed to block the average thief with a scanner/decoder that can be hidden in a coat, purse, bag etc. This gives you great peace of mind AND it is 100% money back guaranteed. So, besides your personal information...what do you have to lose? LOL\n\nDISCLAIMER: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.

We live in Florida, he even wore it in public (I know right, but I wasn't fighting him) and didn't sweat to death, so it's breathable. I'm not sure what the wash and dry suggestions for it are, but I threw it in the washer with all our other clothes and dried it as well, no problems. No fading and no shrinking.

It is so soft and plush. I wouldn't consider the material of this flannel as the title states, it's definitely plush and feels like the soft fur on a stuffed animal. The hood is the Panda's face which is so cute. The face has actual plastic eyes but they are attached very well. The suit itself has a full length zipper down the front and it continues to the backside just a few inches. The zipper is really nice because it is a 2 way zipper so you can zip and unzip from the top or the bottom.\n\nThe foot part is not covered which again, I really like so it's easier to leave shoes on with this. The backside even has a cute little panda tail. I got this for a friend of mine for her to use for Halloween for her little one and to use when it's the Fall season here. The zipper moved freely going both ways and had no sticking or separating. Overall, this is adorable and well worth the cost ($13.99 at the time of review). It's well made and none of the plush comes off. I would recommend this.\nI received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.", "summary": "So Soft & Adorable!", "unixReviewTime": 1463356800}

They come in a soft plastic package with snap closure, I washed all of them immediately and put them in my kids underwear drawer for them. They reported back to me that they are very comfortable and don't feel strange like the other pair. They didn't dig into their sides or leave indents like a lot of underwear can. They already requested that I get rid of all the other ones and buy a couple more packages of these. And at this price, I can easily do that. These don't have an opening in the front so kids can use it to go to the bathroom but my kids said they don't like using the restroom like that anyway, so it doesn't affect us at all.\n\nThese are a great deal and I would recommend for any parents to buy their young kids.

My son has been wearing these briefs since we received and washed them. He says they are so comfortably! My son is a very active kid. These briefs did not rise in the leg area nor did it pinch in areas that would make it uncomfortable. The little logo on the front of these briefs says \"Sport,\" which is way cool because my son is really big into playing all types of sports.

He's  kinda picky with his underwear and likes a nice snug fit that does not ride up or bunch up underneath his pants. He has sensory issues so it is important that there are no tags hanging out (even when I cut them, he can still tell as you never really are able to get all of the tag out) and he easily gets irritated by the itchy plastic.  These briefs do have a tag, but it is located along the side seam, not in the back. I removed it simply by tearing it out and it really did come out very well.\n\nThe material is very soft and waistband is nice and thick, giving it that sturdy feeling. The colors are nice and clean and did not fade in the wash.\n\nThe only downsides to this product are the skrinkage and the length of the legs. They did skrink a bit in the first washing, even though I washed them on the cold water setting. I would say that they are almost, but not quite, a full size smaller than the size I purchased. My son is 10, so I purchased the 9-11 size. They still fit him the way he likes, but they he will grow out of them faster because of the shrinkage...though the material is such a good quality that the construction of the garment will far outlive the amount of time he will be in them! (Good thing he has a younger brother!) Second, the length of the legs...in the vendor picture, the legs look like they will go down a couple, if not a few, inches on the thighs. Before washing these boxer briefs, I noticed that the legs looked a bit shorter than anticipated. After washing them, they are even shorter. They will still work fine, but if you are looking for a longer length, these will shrink in the wash...even if you purchase a size up.\n\nBut overall, these briefs are well-made with quality materials. I do recommend them.\n\nI received this product for a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. Would I purchase these again? Yes.

Many people got fake sunglasses and many people got real ones. I decided to take the risk and worst case scenario, I'd get my money back in the event they were not real Ray-Bans.\n\nMine just arrived today! So my review is very much fresh and new. I own 2 pairs of Ray-Bans (sunglasses and eyeglasses) so I knew to check:\n1. The box for the \"made Italy\" (Milano/Milan)\n2. Check the top left lenses for the engraving of the RB logo\n3. Make sure the shades don't come in a plastic bag but rather the frames (the part that goes behind the ear) are protected by a plastic cover\n4. The case has to be authentic and have the Ray-Ban stamp\n\nMine had all of these details and I am pleased with my purchase of well-priced, lightweight, authentic, Italian made, summer ready, Ray-Bans.\n\nWith every purchase on Amazon its better to double check with the seller where in fact the item is coming from, ask about the authenticity, and other concerns that may arise.\n\nI hope this review was helpful and substantial!", "summary": "Authentic & Lightweight Ray-Bans", "unixReviewTime": 1467072000}

Designer look without the pain of a designer price tag! I receive COUNTLESS compliments on this case which only makes me love it a little more each time! haha\nMine came quicker than I expected and in perfect condition with a clean and vibrant design. It has also stood up to the test of time so far! there is no visible wear or tear on the design which I was worried would fade quickly. From time to time I just give it a quick wipe down with a wet paper towel and it removes most dirt and little stains from daily use.. for the tougher spots I just add a little soap and viola! like new again! Its durability even goes beyond just the design, this case can take a hit! I've dropped my phone inside this case more times than I would like to admit.. it does do a great job of absorbing the shock and keeping my phone safe! It even has raised edges that keeps my screen safe as well! The only cons, which I hardly even consider, are the cutout spots for the camera, charging port and headphone jack. You can't really take a picture with the flash while this case is on. The case itself does not obstruct the view in any way on either camera but if you use the flash on the back camera the photo won't come out properly. As for the charging port and headphone jack you just have to, for lack of a better term, squish it in there.. they do fit and stay put, just needs a little extra help getting there. Other people have stated and asked about the size of the case being an issue but it doesn't bother me at all! in fact if you are anything like me if you don't have your phone in hand its probably lost at the bottom of some never ending purse or backpack.. this case makes my phone so much easier to find through all the clutter! It even fits into SOME of my jean pockets!", "summary": "You can't beat the price! Love this case!!", "unixReviewTime": 1455494400}

There were not as many layers, but it did still puff the dress out a bit. Above all, that layered part was not very comfortable, although it did help to wear stockings under the dress.

I'm very picky about earrings.  They have to be easy to put in, comfortable to wear, & not gaudy.  I normally wear plain, white gold hoops, but it's nice to have a change once in awhile.  I'm also a little avant-garde with my jewelry, so the idea of ear climbers appeals to me.  I've been looking for something simple & clean that I can wear every day.  I've seen a few pair that were interesting, but not quite right.  Then I saw these.  They were perfect!  Just a simple sweep of silver that follows the contour of the ear.  Subtle, & almost art deco.  I was worried about how easy it would be to put in the ear pins , & whether the climbers would stay put, but other reviewers who had had the same concerns did not encounter any problems.  I also appreciated that I would be purchasing directly from the artist who makes them.  I ordered these & also a pair of serpentine climbers to wear for a special occasion coming up.  I prefer while metal, & it was nice that I could order both pairs in sterling silver.  Since they were coming from Greece, I figured it would take several weeks for them to get here.\nThat evening, I found a personal e-mail from Emmanuela, thanking me for the order, & giving me a time frame for shipment.  She sent the climbers FedEx, & they came from Greece to California in 2 days!  I opened the envelope to find them gift boxed with bows & gift bags included (although I bought them for myself, it's a lovely extra).  Each pair of climbers is in a small (probably anti-tarnish) bag, & there are plastic stoppers to keep them in place on your ears.\nAnd they are as lovely as their pictures; in the case of the sweeps, even more so.  In the picture, it looks like the sweep is textured all along its length.  Actually, it's smooth for about 2/3rds of it's length, & only the top part is textured.  This adds to its art deco feel.  The serpentine climbers are very dramatic, just right for the party I intend to wear them to (with my LBD, of course!).\nI ran to the mirror & took about 5 minutes to figure out how to get the climbers to work.  You bend the pin outward & put it through your piercing, like you would an ear hook (so it's hanging upside down).  Put the stopper on the pin, & swing the whole thing around so that it slides over the side of the ear.  The pin runs up the underside of the ear.  I put mine right up against the spot where the ear joins the neck.  Then pinch the pin closed from the bottom up.  The climber stays put & I don't even notice it's there.  Oh, by the way, I wear glasses.  The climbers don't interfere at all (I was wearing my glasses when I put the climbers in).\nAltogether, this has been one of my best buying experiences on Amazon.  I'm impressed by Emmanuela, her attention to her customers, & her product.  I will buy from her again.", "summary": "Beautiful Product & Great Seller", "unixReviewTime": 1477526400}

The sleeves are long enough and there is no extra material bagging anywhere.

So here's the scoop it's worth the $5-10 spent the material is comfy it is on the heavier side the inside feels warm like fleece so this is more for Cold nights . I live in the south so I can only wear this a few months of the year . The quality is good there isn't perfect straight shot stitching but it's still good enough for club or night out wear . It runs long so for petite you might have awkard shaping mine gathers at the bottom  of my crotch and by hips . It says dry clean  ( not sure if you can wash but I'm going to try ) . The green coloring is as pictured and really looks good with hazel or green eyes like myself . The downside is that you have to thread the lacing yourself which was a pain and still unsure if I did it right because it looked funny . It is a little itchy but I'm hoping the wash helps that before wearing  . Overall 4 stars I wish it  wasn't fleece itchy  feeling didn't run large and long but happy with the possibility to shrink it and wear it in the colder months .  Update :::::washed it in cold washer and dried it dryer for awhile shrunk a little which is great ! This can be washed in washer still a little long on the bottom but happy it's not too short . Still itchy :( but okay for few hours use . I added a star because customer service was amazing.

I never order clothing from amazon but decided to give this a go since I was looking for a vest and having a lot of trouble searching within stores. Just to get it out there first, the vest is fantastic. I got it in the \"red\" which is really just a pretty maroon color. Very comfy as well.  I haven't worn it out yet and I live in SoCal so I can't attest to how warm it will keep you.\n\nWith sizing though. I'm 5'6 and about 135 lbs. I'm a size 6 in bottoms (size 6 hips) and a size 4/6 in tops with a small bust. I generally wear a size medium in teen stores (ie Forever 21) and a small in women's clothing. I was planning on going with my normal small but decided to go with a medium after reading all the reviews (its an asian brand so the sizing is smaller, if you're between sizes size up, etc.). I wish I had gone with my typical size and instinct because I received the medium and it was too large for my liking. I'm currently wearing a long sleeve shirt and a sweatshirt and there's still some space. It's not that it runs large, its just that it runs like normal clothing I purchase. If you're a pretty consistent size, I'd recommend sticking with it and not sizing up. I'm thinking about purchasing another one in a small and giving the medium to my mother. Hope this review helped!\n\n*sidenote: The pockets were just fine! (another comment left by a lot of reviewers that the pockets were too small). I suppose I have petite hands but I was still able to fit my iphone 6 and hands in at the same time.

Im a cat lover so I enjoy having cat accessories, and this is a very cute one. I like the way the ring looks with the little ears poking up. The ring is slightly wider than I was expecting so it looks a little less delicate than I thought it would, but thats not really a problem. The cat paws on the back are a cute detail, but I actually think the toes look a little weird. Its like they are too long so they almost look like fingers instead of kitty. The foot pads on the inside of the ring band are really sweet too, but seems unnecessary since it is never visible when you're wearing the ring. The ring seems pretty sturdy - even though it is adjustable it holds its shape well. And its great that its adjustable, since it didn't fit any of my fingers when I had the paws pinched together (which is how it came). It was too big for my pinky finger, but too small for all my other fingers. When I stretch the paws a few millimeters apart I can fit it on my ring finger, and sometimes I like to wear it on my middle finger next to my wedding bands. However, when the paws are stretched apart it kind of pinches my skin between them, making it a little uncomfortable to wear. The edges of the paws are a little rough so it kind of scrapes me when my skin touches the edges.

I've bought a lot of jewelry on Amazon over the years, and I've found that most of the time, plating wears off almost immediately, so it's often worth it to spring for sterling if you want to wear the piece every day without worry.  Obviously, though---it's not the sturdiest ring.  This isn't heavy-duty silver.  SO you can absolutely damage it and bend it out of shape just by innocently doing normal things, like holding a handrail.  I almost ruined a thin silver ring just by gripping my steering wheel too tightly.......I looked at my hand and saw that the bottom of the ring had been compressed flat!  So be careful with this ring if you want to keep it in good condition.  If you grip something super-tight, you'll bend it.\n\nFor now, mine is in good shape. I accepted a sale price on this ring in exchange for a candid review, but my mother and sister love animals as much as I do, so I'm planning ahead for Christmas stocking stuffers.

I was wondering how they could afford to give us real sterling silver at this price, and the answer is....there isn't much sterling silver, because the ring is so unbelievably small!\n\nAs far as the style goes, it's a very stylized Japanese maneki-neko, or \"beckoning cat,\" which is a common good luck symbol.  It's hard to see the detail because the ring is so small, but when you are up close, it's obviously a maneki-neko.\n\nAs far as the ring diameter goes, it's very, very small.  Because it's an open ring, it can accommodate a lot of finger sizes, but right out of the box it's only about a US size 5 or less.  I have thin fingers, so I can fit it on my ring finger unadjusted, but my fingers are like toothpicks.\n\nBecause the ring is barely thicker than a piece of wire, if you grip something really hard with your hand, like a car steering wheel, or railing, you may end up distorting the ring. So this is not going to be a durable piece of jewelry.  You'd be lucky to get a few months of use out of it before it gets all banged out of shape, in my opinion.\n\nBut if you can tolerate all that, and love to collect maneki-neko pieces, this is a cute ring, even if it's not a statement or heirloom piece of jewelry.  I would put this in the category of stackable midi rings, or pinky rings----they don't have to be top quality--they're mostly just for having a little fun.\n\n--Sale priced accepted on this item in exchange for a candid review.--", "summary": "Extremely TINY maneki-neko ring!", "unixReviewTime": 1460419200}

Shipped from San Francisco, arrived on the East Coast in under a week. I ordered the M, and the measurements of the shirt, measured as it lays flat, are: pit-to-pit is 20 inches; length from top of the neck to the bottom hem is 27 inches; shoulder seam to wrist hem is 21.5 inches. It's not stretchy at all; the tag says 100 percent cotton and it feels like it. Had the Russian-language tag sewn on the outside of the back of the shirt. I am 5-8, 155 pounds, slim, and wear a 38/39 suit. I don't mind wearing T-shirts that are somewhat form-fitting as I am super-fit, and I usually wear a S in most shirts and T-shirts. This M fits just a bit looser than what I usually consider form-fitting, which is perfect. If this matters to you, the tag is *NOT* the tag in the photo, but it is written in Cyrillic. I've attached a photo of the tag.\n\nThe biggest problem is that the sewing isn't of great quality -- there's no real front or back -- so it bunches under the arms.\n\nI actually also ordered another similar telnyashka shirt from another seller: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008448QQY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1.\n\nFor some reason, the description on this latter shirt is more descriptive and includes the \"240 gram/square meter\" designation. The one sold as \"Vintage Weave Russian Military Telnyashka\" doesn't have the \"240g/sm\" in the description. I don't know enough about shirt weaves to tell you if it is, but it doesn't feel anymore substanstial (and maybe even less so) than a Hanes Beefy-T. Maybe this is why this is the \"vintage weave\" and not a genuine article? I will compare when the second shirt arrives. Paid ~$12 for the first shirt and ~$18 for the second.

I love it (which is why I obviously own three). I find it extremely flattering and versatile, and I get tons of compliments on it every time I wear one.\n\nAs you can see from the photos, my favorite way to wear these tops is to pair them with dark colored skinny jeans and dark brown boots. With the dark red top I also wore a blanket scarf that matched well with the red color of the top. While I went with a casual look with this top this evening, I really think this top would work just fine with a dressier look as well. I'd just switch from jeans to black skinny dress pants and from boots to heels. Instead of a scarf, I'd go with a longer necklace. It would be great for work. In fact, this is how I normally wear the yellow top\n\nA few things about the top, the fabric is a little thin, especially on the burgundy top. I was able to work around this by adding a tank underneath that kept my bra from being visible. The fabric on the yellow and gray tops seem a bit thicker than the burgundy one. Despite the thinness of the fabric on one shirt, all three of the tops do seem very well made. I inspected them pretty thoroughly for pulled or loose threads, and I didn't find any. I have washed all three of the tops, and they hold up exceptionally well after washing as well. I will say though that since they're a bit thin I usually use a gentle cycle and hang them to air dry.\n\nThe fabric is also very stretchy, so the large fit more like I would expect an extra large to fit. As a frame of reference (see the photo) I'm a size 14, and I had plenty of extra room in this top. For a tunic, I don't really think that's a bad thing. It's just something to be aware of when choosing a size. Overall, I found the top to be very flattering. My stomach is usually my problem area, and this top is very forgiving because it's so flowy in that area. Also, it manages to be roomy in the stomach area without looking like a maternity top. I think this is because the volume of the extra fabric is in the sides not the front.\n\nThe top does tend to wrinkle a bit, but I didn't iron it. I just misted it with water and smoothed the wrinkles out. That seemed to do the trick perfectly.\n\nDisclaimer: I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Fashionable and flattering!", "unixReviewTime": 1452297600}

I would have had to have DDD size breasts to fill it out. It is also very cheaply made, which was surprising considering the $50 they are charging for it. It came to below my knees and I ordered a tule skirt to go under the dress to make the skirt poof out a little bit (if you don't, it just falls flat and doesn't look as good). I also am using cute, chunky red high heels and donning bright red lipstick to complete the look. Also, I know it's petty, but the cuffs were silver and that threw me off. I don't like that it doesn't match the rest of the outfit... Lol.\nI started the process to return this dress and ask for a refund, in which I will order a size Medium instead and pray that it fits!
