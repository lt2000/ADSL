The backer does fit firmly.  I went to a big box store recently looking at comparable earrings, and I was smart to take them out of the box before purchasing.  Those were even shorter posts than these, and I told the sales lady no way could an adult wear such earrings.  Anyways, I think manufacturers are looking for any way to skimp and so now it seems like they are making the posts excessively short (even on larger diameter studs).

However, it came in an envelope without any instructions on how to change the combination.  The product description does say it can be changed as often as you like, so it would be nice to know how to do that!  If they would have enclosed that little instruction paper I would have given them 4 stars. If the spring was stronger I would have given them 5 stars.\n\nOk, figured it out. Was no place to insert a pin (or key) to reset the combination like I've seen on other combination padlocks.  But the \"pin\" on this lock is part of the shackle, the curved part that pushes into the case. You can see the little knob of metal (the pin)on the shackle when it's unlocked, it's hidden when locked and the shackle is pushed into the case.\n\n I made you some instructions for changing the combination:\n1) With it unlocked, hold the lock upright with the numbers facing you.

The parents and grandparents do most of the heavy lifting when it comes to gifts, so what's an aunt on a budget to do?  In addition, my nieces are blessed with a \"high quality lifestyle\", so that often rules out most inexpensive toys.  I needed a very specific type of jewelry piece, but I also needed to keep it age and occasion appropriate.  These bracelets fit the bill perfectly!\n\nThe weight and feel of the piece is good, substantial.  It feels sturdy with a bit of heft to it.  The metal is 18k gold over sterling silver and looks good.  The gold and enamel detailing throughout the design is clean with no sloppy flaws that I could see.  The inside of the bracelet is gold with heart cut outs lining the full circumference of the bracelet.  The box clasp has a \"tongue\" end that fits into a box chamber on the other end and fastenes with two gold clasps on each side that snap down over a little ball-like fixture.  It's sturdy and I don't worry that it will fall off.  At the same time, it's slim and inconspicuous.\n\nThe oval shape of the bracelet ensures it will sit nicely on a small wrist.  The width and height of the design is about 1/8 inch.  The diameter of the bracelet measures 2 1/8 inches horizontally, measuring from the inside of the left side to the inside of the right and 1 3/4 inch from top to bottom.  The overall size and appearance of the design is substantial but not too heavy or bulky.\n\nThe designs are also very age and occasion appropriate.  The colors are bright and designs cute but there's no cheese factor.  The style is appealing while also being very refined.  They would be perfect for any occasion.  The nice quality doesn't work against it.  Some pieces I found seemed too \"keepsake\" -like but these have a really special quality to them without being too special, if that makes any sense.  And at this price, I'm actually quite stunned and pleasantly surprised.  This is a great value.\n\nOverall, a really beautiful piece that's appropriate for young girls, really nice quality and an amazing price.  These have saved \"cool Aunt Mimi\" this Christmas!  I highly recommend these!!", "summary": "Nice Quality, Age Appropriate", "unixReviewTime": 1355875200}

Not only with the simplistic style, but by placing some of the classic movements that Seiko had been known for with years in their timepieces like having new solar watches that have been met with both classic and simplistic style, but also in value. They have been very strong in moves, because people have been deeply overlooking their Pulsar watches in favor of Seiko's mainstream line. That also has been said with their automatic quartz watches from the Seiko Kinetic line, which have been deeply under-recognized in the classic horologists eyes in movement and price. This silver-tone piece from Pulsar is a nice looking classic watch in value, has good water resistance and easy to setup time. But that is really it. It really gets its energy by the movement of the wrist, like a automatic watch to charge the battery. Yet, there could've been more for the value of the piece like better illuminated hands to see the watch's time in the dark, and a easier to see date window. Overall, this still is a classic watch that Seiko has shown for their Pulsar line, but honestly with their new Solar watches, I would honestly consider passing this one up.\n\nPrice: C-\n\nSetup  & Comfort: C+\n\nOverall: C 1/2+", "summary": "Automatic Quartz", "unixReviewTime": 1453075200}

It has masculine lines and was exactly what I had in mind.  I remained cautiously optimistic about what I'd get for a couple of reasons:\n\n1.  The product description doesn't list dimensions.  Photos are deceptive (as we all know).\nAs I awaited delivery I decided if I got:\n\nThe size of a Kennedy $0.50 piece=Ideal.\nThe size of a quarter=Most likely, so okay.\nThe size of a nickel=Underwhelming.\n\nResult:  Ideal.\n\n2.  Craftsmanship:  Again, hard to gauge based on a photo.  At the $30 price point, I was skeptical. But I liked the fact it was described to be stainless steel, a non-precious metal which is appropriate for Muslim men to wear.\n\nResult:  Exceeds expectation.\n\nWhy? The calligraphic script is lovely, and appears to be durable and not cheaply painted (I.e. durable to wear). The \"swivel\" design (think globe) is a nice touch which is very distinctive in design.  Finally, the caliph, \"M'ashaAllah\" graces one side of the \"coin\" and the other side displays the jeweler logo.  But has ample room to have an inscription engraved.\n\n3.  Deliverable:  Being end of Ramadan, I was skeptical of getting the item in time, although it was listed as \"in stock\".\n\nResult:  Amazon delivers, when they say they will.\n\nConclusion:  Buy with confidence.", "summary": "This product exceeded expectations.", "unixReviewTime": 1375920000}

Anyway, as usual I thought to myself, it is not a horrible looking piece, so I tried it, it just broke today, stopped turning. I have just sent in a return request, so I am in hopes the seller will replace it with the product I ordered and it actually works for some time.\n\n 2 days later I received a reply from the seller, they basically stated that Amazon sometimes makes the mistake with the wrong picture or they did, i did not get a straight answer. At any rate I was informed that the watch winder is not guaranteed or warranted as stated in the fine print of their website.  I did advise them I will pay for shipping for a replacement but would like the one in the picture and would even pay a little extra for it or for another winder superior in quality. The response so far is less than favorable in that I was told I can only exchange with all of the original packaging. Who keeps the original box?\n\nThe final outcome is less than satisfactory, I was offered to send back the broken item \"as is\" along with $35.00 for a new one. So I am sure with shipping it will cost me about $15.00 so another $50.00 total, plus the original $72.00, now I am out $132.00 and for the same item I didn't order. I told them forget it as I will purchase another product for that amount that will work and look like I expect it too and actually run longer than a month, what a sham.", "summary": "Hoping the seller has  good business ethics", "unixReviewTime": 1360368000}

Anyway  I ended up returning the shirt as I wasn't permitted to do an exchange.

She tried it on her tapestry purse to secure her fit-over sunglasses (wrap around sunglasses that fit over prescription glasses) but the sunglasses came out when something brushed against the purse.

She's hesitant to make two pin holes in her favorite black leather jacket, but she thinks the big sunglasses would probably stay put.  Even if they don't, she likes the design and utility of the pin.  She occasionally has to take her prescription glasses off to read labels and tags, and this pin would give her a good place to temporarily put her glasses when shopping or browsing.  She usually tried putting them on top of her head or in the brim of her favorite fedora, but the glasses always slid off quickly, so this pin definitely solves one problem for her.

The heels do not slip and there is plenty of room for toes to be comfortable, but not excess room.  The insole is contoured (arch support) and well padded.  There is a small heel (1.5\") which allows these to be walk-all-day in comfort boots.  I get compliments on them every time I wear them. They have enough room for wearing over slim leg jeans, but also look OK (not too roomy) with tights and a skirt.  The full inside zip makes them easy to put on and to wear over jeans/leggings.  The shaft height is 15.5\" tall and the circumference at the widest point is also 15.5\".\nI would love to get another color, but they are sold out everywhere that I look.

They look FANTASTIC! The picture doesn't do them justice. They look a little squished and clunky if the photo, but they are very elegant on your feet. I usually have trouble walking in bevel-toe heels, but these are not quite so beveled as other platforms, and are very comfortable. Fits true to size, with just a little extra room in the heel, which helps against blisters.\n\nThe only con I have found does involved that little extra room though. The vamp (the material on the sides) and the toe box only allow for the smallest no-see socks. If you want to wear hose or tights with these, I would suggest buying a non-slip front foot (ball) pad insert as your foot may slide a little forward while walking because the insert in these are rather slick.

The shoe seems to fit when you first try them on, but the inside sole of the shoe is built with a weird hard material around the toes (not to mention that it's also pointy on the toes), which makes it hard to run up and down the court because your feet are constantly rubbing on the hard inner sole, causing blisters. I remember wearing them for 2 games and immediately taking them off to play in my Vans. My Vans are more comfortable than wearing these Nikes, which is sad. I like the ankle support in these shoes, but the inner sole kills the whole idea of wearing these shoes for me.\n\nHowever, the seller of these shoes was very fast on shipping, and had no problems during the buying/shipping process.

This dress is so stylish and cute!\nIm 53, 117 lbs, 34DD, 36-27-36 and I ordered a size S based on the sellers size chart. It fits beautifully, so for me the size chart was accurate.\nIts made from a very lightweight knit fabric thats also very soft. I would say its comparable to t-shirt fabric. The kind of t-shirt that has some nice drape to it, not the heavy thick cotton kind. As a result the dress is very comfortable. I love being able to wear a dress and still feel comfortable.\nThe belt is cute, but its really long. I didn't like the way it was hanging past my knees, so I did some kind of wrap around thing that shortened it. Because the braided belt has a messy look at the ends, it worked without making it look too strange. Perhaps its because I did this additional wrap-around, but I didn't have any problems with the belt coming untied as other reviewers mentioned. Or perhaps its because I had read about that before I ever wore the dress so I knew to tie it firmly. In any case, my belt stayed tied throughout the entire workday without any need for adjustment.\nI was so taken with how cute this dress was when I received it that I totally forgot to check over the seams to identify if its well made. But I wore it to work all day and didn't notice any issues while doing so.\nI got several complements (that weren't from my mom, lol) on this dress when I wore it, and I always feel like thats the best way to tell when something looks good on you.\nTo sum it up, sizing is accurate if you use the size chart, the fabric is soft and stretchy, and it looks good.

The design makes me laugh and giggle-snort in a fan-girly way, which is why I got it. It's genius. But alas, that it the only good thing about it for me. The reason I had to return this shirt is because, not matter how many times I washed it, the fabric stayed stiff and gave me and awkward shape. And since I am female, and have the whole chest thing going on, the design literally stuck out because it's made of the stiff photo-press plastic, which was just awkward and uncomfortable. I really liked this shirt, but overall it just gave me an awful shape. I'm a bit on the heavier side, so I thought it might look good on a thinner person, so my friend, who is fairly average sized, ordered one and it did the same thing for her.

As to the watch itself...\n\nWhile I could compare the Dragon King to something like the Orient Mako, I believe Sea-Gull is aiming higher with this model. This watch has a sapphire crystal and a hacking, hand winding, 28,800 bph movement cloned from the ETA 2824 - the Sea-Gull ST-21 in Sea-Gull's top grade, AAA. As such, I'll provide some comparisons to my Baume & Mercier 8779 and the Edox C1, both of which use an ETA 2824 movement. The B&M cost me around $900, although it is currently selling for more.  I got the Edox as a gift for a relative on a daily deal site for $270, but it regularly sells for around $450.\n\nThe DK comes in a very solid cardboard box with a Chinese dragon in gold on it. Inside, the watch rests on a pillow inside a cardboard separator. I would say the box is a bit nicer than the typical Seiko box, not at the same level as the typical Swiss box. The watch shares the box with a unique warranty card featuring an embossed dragon, the invoice, and a truly awful instruction manual translated by someone who didn't speak much English. \"Automatic mechanic watch that is winded by swing rotor, so regular exercise (Don 't designedly), and wearing the watch at lest 8HS every day.\" Interestingly, although the watch is called \"SEA-GULL\" on its dial, it is called \"Seagull\" in the manual. The watch was very securely wrapped in plastic inside the box.\n\nThis is a large watch, by my standards, at 43mm. The lugs are well contoured and it fits me very well. The bracelet is one of the most comfortable I've encountered, despite a lack of half links. Seagull attempts to make up for that with micro-adjustments on the clasp, but there is only one adjustment point. So if you don't get lucky with the length of the links, you could be in trouble. The links also feature push pins rather than the B&M and Edox's screw pins, not surprising at this price point. They were fairly easily removed, however. The bracelet also has an attractive combination of brushed and polished metal - polished on the outside, brushed in the middle, but with a sunken, polished strip down the center. The clasp is a very solid single fold with a double push button action. Other than the lack of half-links and screw pins, I would consider the bracelet to be at least as good as the B&M's, and I certainly like the clasp better than my Ulysse Nardin's. The clasp has \"SEA-GULL\" engraved on it. After months of use, I still find it very comfortable despite its size and weight.\n\nThe case is brushed, with a consistent finish, and feels very solid. The crown is polished, screw-down and has an embossed \"S.\" It is protected by a conventional crown guard. The action is firm - not as solid as the B&M, but the overall design is probably a bit better than the Edox. The bezel is a very typical Rolex Submariner homage, nowhere near as interesting as the B&M's dodecagonal model. It's not quite a literal Sub (the 0-15 scale is not marked differently from the other indices) but it's pretty close, down to the scalloping. The 120-click bezel does not quite align properly with the dial - one of the two flaws that keep this watch from quite matching its Swiss competitors.\n\nThe dial itself is matte black with SEA-GULL / Automatic / Dragon King / 200M printed in white. It somewhat resembles an Omega Seamaster.  A number of different fonts are used, but it works pretty well. There is also a blue chapter ring with minute indices and 5-minute numeric indicators, with an orange \"60\" at twelve o'clock. The printing is crisp, not quite at B&M levels but perhaps slightly better than Edox. Indices are applied, simple lozenges with large bits of white lume painted on. The indices are not as refined as the B&M or Edox, and on a couple of them the lume is not quite centered. You can't see that with the naked eye but it's visible with a 10x loupe. Again, quality is probably comparable to Edox, not at B&M levels. The hour and minute hands are standard batons, heavily lumed. The second hand is a little more interesting, with a large counterweight and two lumed dots towards the end. The second hand reaches the end of the indices, the minute hand the mid-point. The hour hand doesn't quite reach the indices.\n\nSpeaking of the lume, Kevin Ma (Sea-Gull's US dealer, and a real pleasure to deal with) admitted on the WUS forum that it wasn't up to Seiko levels. That's definitely true. And it's not even close to the B&M's league. This is not for lack of lumed material, which is abundant - the quality of the lume just isn't there.\n\nThe back of the watch features an engraved Chinese dragon that looks great, and, along with some other text, an indication that this is #23 of 800. I doubt a limited edition Sea-Gull is all that collectible - I suspect Sea-Gull will have a Dragon King II when this edition runs out, which may be better.\n\nIt seems to have settled at about +12 seconds per day, pretty comparable to the B&M.  What remains to be seen is the durability of the black anodization on the bezel. The B&M really shines there - despite being one of my more abused watches, there isn't a scratch in that anodization, whereas my wife's Orient sub homage is all scratched up despite much less wear. I will report back after further use of the Sea-Gull - after a couple of months of light use, it's still looking good.\n\nFinally, and disappointingly, unlike other Sea-Gulls this one does not say \"China Made\" anywhere on it. I think I know why they did that, but it's disappointing that they won't advertise the national origin of their new \"flagship.\"\n\nThis is a watch that is almost fully competitive with brands like Hamilton for a significantly lower price. I struggled with the question of four vs. five stars - it is a great value for the money. So why did I settle on four?  Because it's intended to be a dive watch, and the slightly mis-aligned bezel and inferior lume detract from that intended function.  If they improve the alignment of the bezel and the lume on the next edition, this watch will be an easy five star watch, fully competitive with a good, basic Swiss automatic, at a substantially lower price.", "summary": "Excellent watch for the price - a couple of flaws", "unixReviewTime": 1352419200}

I wish it wasn't so *pricey* and the shipping was a bit much as well. So this was definitely a splurge. It's larger than I thought it would be b/c I couldn't invision the dimensions given. It's nearly true to color. Not as neon as the picture seems to show, but it *is* a beautiful orange! When you open the top, the inside has two sections. The upper top has a small vertical oval mirror on the left, and a pocket on the right. When you unlatch the tab (velcro strap) the divider folds down so you can section smaller items in the upper/top section. This divider is not supported so I suggest storing items in separate cases/bags or they may fall everywhere. I plan to use the upper space to store my make-up items, and the lower section to hold my hair items. (Brush, blow dryer, hair spray etc.)\n\nHere are the dimensions that I've measured: height 9.5 in., width 13.5 in. at middle/top (it tapers down) and about 12.5 in. at the bottom, and 8 in. in depth.\n\nMy only complaint is, there 2 teeny-tiny marks on the front, one on the top above the zipper, and the other on the bottom half, in the middle.

Ordered a few different pairs from different manufacturers and returned them all except the SAXX Kinetic Boxers. Wore them for four days of straight walking and washing them every day.

I've been able to get accurate paces and locations (usually within 100 feet)\n- Plastic makes the watch durable and the band is comfortable as long as it isn't too tight\n- Once a signal is acquired, it hardly ever loses signal. I even took it to Yosemite once on some light hiking and it never dropped signal\n- Never used it in the night for anything besides a watch, but the night light works fine\n- It syncs with Strava through the downloadable Soleus apps on PC and Mac\n- When I bought this it was around $50 and it does the basics of what more expensive trackers do\nCons:\n- Battery life is decent but after a few months it became very inconsistent. sometimes I would go cycling for an hour and the watch would drop down to one bar and return to two bars a while later. Charging is also wonky sometimes with it taking a few minutes to reach 60% or 70% and another hour to reach 100%\n- It has no Bluetooth so you're forced to use the computer app if you every want to upload your data to Strava\n- I ran into a door once and the watch took most of the hit, breaking the bottom band off. A bit of superglue fixed it, but it came loose after a few months\n- Getting a signal often takes up to 10 minutes so unless you plan all of your runs, you'll end up waiting a while for the watch's signal or possibly miss tracking part of your workout\n- Navigating through the watch's functions is sometimes cumbersome and I find that sometimes it takes a considerable amount of force to press the buttons\nOverall thought:\nFor the price I got this for, it's worth it. For the current price of $100, I'd rather look at some other fitness trackers.

It takes a while to get a signal, but all gps watches are like that. Had to look for the user manual on soleus' web page to learn how to program and use it. It's not that easy to use, but it's a matter of getting used to the watch. Another con is it's pretty big, my wrist is slim and have to buckle the strap almost all the way, but I don't mind. The back is silicon -not metal as i read in another review. The features are ok. I used to use a Garmin watch, and there are some features which I miss from my old garmin: if you program it to auto lap every km, you can't take shorter laps with the lap button while you are running; you have to stop and switch the auto lap off (can't have both at the same run, and i generally run a few  warm up kms and then run short laps) . Also, you can see the pace of the current lap, but not the average pace -at least not in a simple way like the garmin watch. Another feature I miss is the fact that it doesn't vibrate when it reaches the lap distance, so if you are listening to music you might not hear the beep.\nHaving said that, I like the watch very much, nice design, and it works great. Still cannot beleive I got a GPS watch for only $10", "summary": "Great GPS watch for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1503360000}

I sleep in it, walk in it, wear it all the time. Size large works just fine for me. The velcro is wearing a little, which is a shame, and it's lost a little bit of its shape, but it's still totally worth it. Basically it keeps me from being bedridden because even walking down a hall without it feels painful. I'd recommend it to anyone with a multiple pregnancy.\n\nI am also glad I got the black, since I wear it all the time, I can wear it over black yoga pants or skirts if I want and it doesn't jump out at you. And since I wear it constantly and have to adjust it every bathroom run, sometimes it's easier to just wear it on top. I think it's a little more comfortable over a thin layer of clothing (but it's okay under, too).\n\nOther than a pregnancy pillow, this was my most essential twins pregnancy purchase and kept me moving (and working) longer than I would have otherwise.\n--\n\nI can't speak to its longevity, but I can say that as a 28 week person pregnant with twins, this saved my day yesterday and today. I am still working and was finding it difficult to move around, stand up and sit down, lean forward, etc. I was having abdominal pain and my doc suggested a support band. I picked this one on the reviews and had it overnighted and delivered to me at work. I put it on right away and found I was able to do things I haven't done in a month, mostly getting up and down more, walking more, doing stairs felt better, leaning down felt better, and I realized how much pain I had actually been in once I put this on and the pain went away. I mean, I'm still huge and pregnant, but movements don't rock me like they were doing. I can move more.\n\nThere's no instructions so I wasn't sure how to wear it. I showed my doc and she said wear it LOW. It doesn't go over your belly, it goes under/below it, and the back part covers part of your butt. (Originally I was wearing it too high before I showed her.)\n\nI read online you shouldn't wear it ALL the time - any belly band - but my perinatologist said as long as I wear it as intended, nice and low, I can wear it as much as I want, even to sleep.\n\nThis thing is easy to put on with no crazy straps, it feels soft directly on my skin (it's bamboo!), it didn't stink like chemicals or anything and I was comfortable putting it on immediately...I think it's going to be a huge help. I had no idea what size to get so I got a large but it might be a little too big. I figured size large because its twins and my belly is so big, but I was a size small before the pregnancy so a medium would have probably been okay. It doesn't actually really go OVER your belly so consider that in sizing, it's not so much your belly size but your hips and butt. I am too lazy to try exchanging it so I'll just stick with the large, I think, plus I can't live without it now. A little too big is okay, it just gaps a tiny bit in the back.\n\nI was wearing a dress yesterday - a tight one - and you couldn't see this at all in the front. In the back it simply gave me an extra flat butt because it covers a lot of my butt. Whatever though.\n\nIf this just gets me through a few more weeks of work where I can actually be PRODUCTIVE instead of sitting in a chair staring at things I'd like to move but don't want to, it will be worth the money.

Before the first one arrived, I had wondered if they could double as a dramatic long dress, but they just don't hold that honor.  The material is a satin polyester with just a bit too much shine for sophistication.  That being said, they are a lovely option for home, and every bit so for answering the door to deliveries and such (it doesn't feel like I'm caught in my nightgown).  Additionally, wearing these kaftans at home helps save wear and tear on my going-out clothes I would otherwise wear.  One con is that the fabric likes static (winter time here in Washington state).  A pro is the great price.  Just the amount of yardage used justifies the price.  I took off one star because the sewing quality on the neck on this one wasn't the finest.

First, while it has two large pockets, they are on opposite sides of the wallet. The one I used to use had a large pocket and small pocket on the same side. Second, the material is a lot thicker and much less rigid than that one, meaning it's more prone to bending and folding and takes up much more space at the same time.\n\nThe one benefit is the single belt loop style, which is less difficult to use than the double belt loop for the one I had in Germany. However, that's also a drawback, as it means this thing hangs lower and is more prone to getting bent when you sit down, vs. the other one which had two belt loops on the long side, so it sat closer to your waist and was less like to get bent. Unfortunately the belt loops on my old one eventually came undone, so I got this one rather than spend time trying to resew them on.

The braided design and antiquing are very well done. The picture is a very accurate representation of the product I received, the only difference being it's a bit more polished, which I actually like better. It's stamped 925 on the inside reflecting the grade of sterling silver used. The spinner is smooth and fits nicely within the channel.

Its an automatic mechanical watch with a style that is somehow both elegant and perhaps slightly fussy with a baroque and steampunk look to it. Its an automatic mechanical watch which means that it does not use a battery.\n\nThe front face is lovely. It is a fairly thick plain gold bezel with a slightly convex glass behind which you have a beautifully detailed black and gold face which incorporates many small details. The large clock face surrounds three additional miniature dials that denote the date, day of the week and 24 hours. The main clock face is easy to read with large roman numerals. Oddly 3, 6 and 9 are missing but you don't really notice because the inset border that surrounds the miniature dials tapers towards those points defining those unlabeled hours well enough.\n\nThe hands are of medium thickness tapering at both ends in an elongated kite shape. There is a seconds hand which is a needle with a small disk at the pointing end. The hands are inset with some luminous material that glows green in the dark. The seconds hand has only the disk glow while the other hands glow along the whole length.\n\nThe crown is golden and nicely knurled with a golden slab on each side. When pushed in, the crown can be used to wind the mechanism. Pulled out, you set the time. Meanwhile the gold slabs at each side are actually mechanical buttons which with each click moves either the date or the day along one position. It works very well and is simple to use.\n\nAutomatic mechanical movement\n\nAs I mentioned, this is not a battery operated watch. It uses a mechanical winding mechanism. It you turn the watch over, the back plate has a large glass window inset behind which you can see the mechanism. A large half circle center mounted pendulum rocks back and forth when the watch moves. The movement winds the watch. Behind the pendulum you can see some of the inner workings, wheels and cogs rotating and rocking back and forth. Its quite fascinating and very cool.\n\nOther than that you have a black leather strap with white stitching and a simple gold buckle. Its an attractive watch that looks good with almost anything thanks to the black and gold combination. But it looks especially nice peeking out from behind a cuff of a shirt and dark blazer.\n\nIn Use\n\nThe watch works wonderfully but you do need good eyesight to read the miniature dials for date, day and 24 hours. The detail on the face is great but my husband for whom I got this watch for needs good light (preferably daylight) in order to read them. The main clock face is easy to read which is the main thing.\n\nThe instructions state to wind the watch twice a day. My husband found that so long as you wear it and are fairly active you only have to wind it at night before going to bed. The automatic winding through the weighted pendulum that uses your movement works well enough. Pitching it about 20 or so degrees a couple of times is enough to get the mechanism started from stopped. So if you are active it keeps itself wound up quite well. Having said that, you can always wind the crown at any time for insurance. If you forget to wind it before you put it away for the night it will have stopped by the morning and will need the time set again.\n\nConclusion\n\nIts a lovely inexpensive watch and my husband really likes it. It is a medium size but still qute thick. He noticed the strap is not as big as some, he has reasonably wide wrists of about 7.5 inches and there is only just enough strap to fit a 8 inch wrist and still capture the pointed end of the strap in the loop.\n\nIts a really nice watch that comes in a nice flat dark bronze display box. Its not too heavy and looks really nice. We both like it.\n\nDisclaimer: I received this watch in exchange for an honest and fair review.  The opinions expressed are my own.", "summary": "Good mechanical watch", "unixReviewTime": 1468886400}

The canvas exterior seems durable, readily cleanable, porous enough to soak the pith, but tight enough that the helmet doesn't drip even when well soaked, and well stitched.  Rivets are solidly applied, as is the metal crown vent.  The waterproof canvas interior is glued to the pith (no data as yet as to how well the glue holds up) and stitched  under the canvas brim.\n  I researched he market looking for a pith helmet.  An official British Army helmet runs hundreds of dollars.  There is a wide variety of reproduction helmets, mostly of various British uniforms.  I like the look of this style, it  reminds me of Life Guards when I was a kid.\n  Functionally, the he provides excellent shade for the head, eyes, ears, and neck, yet is light and stable under a high wind.  The chin strap may never be used.  When properly fitted, the headband provides a layer of air between the head and the helmet.  If the helmet gets soaked (outside only - plug all holes and submerge to the brim [caution, the fully soaked pith may be soft and subject to deformation]) the process of evaporation cools the helmet, and hence the head.

The ruching and off-the-shoulder design elements are very flattering for us fuller figured gals, and the fringe accents just the right places without being too much decoration. The bra section can be adjusted as to how much cleavage one wants to show, which is always a good thing. The disappointing parts were the accessories - the \"hat\" is a collapsible ring with fabric stretched over it, and the \"choker\" is a ribbon with a very fake-looking jewel pinned on it.

Plus I have a 7 from a long time ago, and it was small, too snug, and the fingers are too short, though now that I have been wearing them for driving all this time they have stretched a bit. These 7+1/2 ones are close-fitting but fit very well - however I do NOT have long nails. I tested the color fastness, rubbing them on my skin and on paper and nothing came off. They will be a gift for my Mom; if she needs a larger size I will keep these and order another pair for her at a size 8.\n\nThe pictures for these gloves are terrible, made the company (FursNewYork QuantityBuy) look fly-by-night, because in the pictures I saw the gloves very obviously don't fit the model (way too big - though does she have long nails? But even the palm part looks too big) and the whole picture looks cheesy. I was worried they would be knock-offs and not genuine leather and cashmere. So I contacted Fownes after trying to buy them elsewhere, to try to buy them directly from the manufacturer, as the non-Amazon retailers I found on the web that I trust (Nordstrom's, Dillard's) didn't have the color or size I needed online, and I am 55 miles from the nearest one. Fownes directed me back to those retailers and to Amazon. All of the Amazon links Fownes sent were for QuantityBuy. I wrote back, naming this Amazon seller (FursNewYork QuantityBuy) specifically to make sure, and Fownes assured me they are a \"verified, authorized\" dealer for them. QuantityBuy shipped them immediately and the gloves arrived very quickly. They are genuine leather, soft cashmere inside and beautiful.

This made the costume fit a little odd in places - little too low in crotch, tight across shoulders.  I also agree with another review I read - it makes shoes a tricky situation.  It's hard to fit shoes inside the costume - I found even socks a tight fit.  I bought the costume to wear to a mud run with obstacles however, so I made some modifications before I used it.  I ended up cutting slits in the feet so I could slide my toes through - I wore tennis shoes over the feet.  I also cut the hand portion of the gloves off (I knew I would be climbing many things in the mud - wanted traction!).  The costume was warm - a plus in November when you are wet and muddy.  And it survived beautifully.  I was able to rinse off the majority of the mud with the portable showers they had at the race.  I didn't see any visible holes, etc - and I was crawling through some nasty mud.  And overall I came out of the race fairly unscathed - so worked great for me.

Mine was projected to arrive after October 31st, I believe (and I think I ordered it in early October), but it in fact arrived before then, so not too bad. The sculpture is great, but here was the big problem for me...\n\nThis mask comes with an adjustable strap, as if it was meant to be worn as a mask. I am not sure why they would do that, since anyone ordering this is wanting it as a film prop replica, and it makes no sense to wear it. In the film, when this mask is put on the face, it is merged with the face and becomes something different entirely. Wearing this mask as it is makes no sense. Someone buying this is going to hang it on the wall, or carry it around, or in my case, I used it as an aquarium decoration. It is lifesize and looks awesome in my aquarium, but the problem of the straps is removing them. They are attached with metal pieces that are a brutal exercise to remove, even with wire cutters like I used. In the process, I actually broke off a good sized part of one side of the mask! On the bright side, superglue reattached it like new, and with its grain replica design, there's no way you can tell. On the downside, there are holes in each side where the metal pieces for the straps were. Small, but if you look right at 'em, you won't miss 'em. I suppose they can be filled in with something. I'll have to do that soon.\n\nThe other thing is that, while it is impressive looking and the metal-looking piece in the middle (the nose piece) is beautifully painted to look like real metal, the rest of the mask is a solid, dark brown color. I ended up giving it streaks of a light green wash with acrylic paint, and it came out pretty good. So, basically, if you order this mask, expect some more work to do on it. Have superglue on handy, and go to the hobby store and get a tube of light green, acrylic paint, or as I used, mix some blue and yellow. Also, have some wire cutters and superglue on hand. And, don't try to put a green wash over the metal area. It looks better without it. I'm going to have to repaint that area myself, unfortunately, but the only reason I tried the green wash there was because some of the metal paint chipped off at some point. Maybe it was too thin and flaked off in the fish tank. However, I got some paint to redo it and will take care of that soon. Yeah, it sounds like a lot of work, but it looks amazing when you remove the straps and tweak it with some painting, so it is definitely worthwhile, and this was one of the cheaper versions I was able to find.", "summary": "Very good, but not perfect.", "unixReviewTime": 1384128000}

So if you are larger than me, chances are you won't find a size of this top for you, or in many other clothes in places like Japan or Hong Kong.\nThe good:  it is about the only nursing turtle neck top that I can find in the US.  I tried milk nursing wear, figure8maternity, local retail stores like motherhood, boob design....etc.  There is just NO nursing turtle neck that I can layer under my regular sweaters, you know, just a loose fit/ bat wings sleeves but way better quality real wool sweaters, such as Ann Taylor.  I am so glad I fit into its largest size.  ( now if only one of the others offer a good nursing turtle neck, my review would be different.  Also, I am willing to pay even more for a good one but alas.....)\nThe bad:  totally agree with another reviewer on that there is way too many things happening under the \"hood\".  They design in strange straps and pads there, and I just removed the pads and other stuffs.  Also, there is a chemical smell right out of the bag.  Although it disappears after wash.  I suspect it is the thin polyurethane strip used to finish the inner layer, which in my opinion, totally unnecessary.  They should just save all the trouble on the pads and straps, and use the cost to do a decent finish for the inner layer.

I started out using two inch suspenders that would support the use of a shoulder pad for easing the burden of carrying my saw on a long walk in to my strip. I tired of that and switched to a belt and let my shoulder suffer choosing, rather, to have a belt that would support my wedges and a scabbard for a small falling axe.\n\nNow, years later, I no longer work in the woods and I am no longer a trim chap and to ease the hip pain from having to tighten my belt up to the max just to hold my pants up, I've once again switched to suspenders. I bought a pair of these Filson (long) suspenders, they are cadillacs, one and half inch suspenders that are made of tough materials. Probably too good and pretty expensive for the likes of me. I am going to test out some other brands and if they are similar (and less expensive) I will most likely switch my buying preferences in that direction. These Filsons are great. In the woods, as in most of life, some of the best things are merely tradition, tradition, tradition. While these might be overkill and very dressy, they are not solely the realm of starched shirt foresters, but, sure, they can wear them too.\n\nThe leather button-ends of these suspenders are high quality and very stiff and, therefore, very difficult to button (or unbutton, which is the point of a good set of wood's suspenders).\n\nI'll rework a statement that an old woodsman told me about surmounting the difficulty of making choker cables cooperate with what you want them to do, in regard to the difficulty that some have in buttoning the leather button-ends that these suspenders have . . . \"Boy, you've just got to be a little smarter than the leather.\"\n\nUpdate: I have been wearing these suspenders daily and, while they still fit my 6'3\" frame, they seem to have less adjustability today then they did originally, so they seem to be shrinking over time. They have not been washed or dried and are rarely rain saturated, but nevertheless . . .\n\nI still think that these are worth the 5 star rating.", "summary": "These work.", "unixReviewTime": 1353110400}

However, my husband assured me that he can't see skin (although I will have to be sure and wear a dark bra) and I didn't buy it to be a toasty warm sweater....just the opposite.  I get so hot when we visit certain homes during the winter because they've got their heat cranked so far up, it's hard to breathe!  I need something that looks nice but is lightweight.  This is perfect!  The ribbed hem keeps it from being too stretchy at the bottom and the ribbed cuffs make the sleeves just snug enough that you can push them up and they stay but are not too tight.  The fabric is lightweight and soft without being too flimsy and clingy.  The neck is not tight but is a little high.  I suppose you could just roll it twice if ot bothered you.  It's absolutely true to size!  I'm 5'8\" and 240lbs.  I usually wear a size 24/26 top (with a generous D cup and big ol' back porch) and I ordered a 1X.  It fits perfectly with just enough blousiness (hope that's a word) that it doesn't feel snug.  Very comfortable.  I have to say, it's definitely not an expensive looking shirt but it doesn't look like it came off the Walmart clearance rack, either.  It's just a good shirt to put on when you want to look nice but you're going to grandma's where it's going to be 95 degrees inside!\n****Addendum to original post: I just looked at this product again and it has doubled in price since I bought it TWO DAYS AGO!  I'm telling you, ladies, it was barely worth $27!!!!  It's definitely not worth $50!!!  How ridiculous!  I'm knocking off two stars.

The color was vibrant and the size and heft were just right--light but just right for using as a scarf and not necessarily a shawl.  But then I noticed the tag: it was way too far away from a corner and the adhesive was fierce: 2 thin strips of tape that fastened the folded-behind ends of the tag to the fabric.  This tag was also a laundry guide, stated the product was made in China and identified the fabric as \"70% pashmina 30% silk.\" I honestly don't know if there's any pashmina (wool) or silk in it but that doesn't bother me...rayon or viscose is fine as long as the wrap is pretty and has no bad smell.  Unless of course I can't remove the adhesive or there are any runs in the fabric. The turquoise had both problems. So I contacted the company and explained the problem and asked for my money back. Happily, their answer was yes. I asked if they wanted me to return the wrap? No, just send us a picture: fine, even if they're verifying my honesty, as long as they're not making me return it, I don't mind.  So I emailed them a couple pics and they refunded my purchase in full (no shipping charged in the first place, another bonus). As I told them, I might be able to wear it but would have to take pains to cover up the adhesive and make sure it doesn't stick to itself. There is also the run to look out for.\n\nI told the company that in appreciation for the refund, I'd buy another scarf. I cruised up and down the colors because the price varies a few dollars. I chose this \"fuschsia\" (yes, I'm cheap...and I'm like a magpie with bright colors!) and just got it today. The tag is a little different: doesn't have the laundry instructions or country made, and the adhesive is a glue that covers the whole back of the tag instead of 2 strips. Jeez...I just tried to carefully pry the tag off and it pulled threads way out of shape. I know enough about woven things that you can often ease threads back properly if you gently tug a handful of fabric from both directions. That did help a bit but from either side of the scarf you can make out where the tag was.  There are also 2 small runs in this wrap but they're no biggie. You should know that this fabric snags easily.\n\nSo for nice size and color, and good customer service, I give it 5 stars. For the annoying tags and runs, I give it 2 stars. This averages to 3 1/2 stars which I bump up to 4 because you can't beat this price.\n\nSo I cautiously recommend this scarf. Only if you want to use it exclusively as a shawl or for a formal occasion will it not work. (And shame on you if you'd pay so little for such a visible accessory for a wedding or whatever.)", "summary": "The turquoise and fuschsia [sic]... they merit 3 1/2 stars so I rounded it up to 4", "unixReviewTime": 1395273600}

I traveled for 2 weeks across southern England and Paris and only used this suitcase and the eBags Mother Load backpack. I was looking for something that made the best use of space and could fit a much as possible.  It is very well designed and using any of the outer compartments/pockets or the mesh pocket on the inside did not take away from the size of the main compartment by pushing into it.  I used the eBag travel cubes to keep my clothes organized, which helped a lot to keep everything from getting wrinkled  and made a great use of the small space.  It expands well to add lots of extra room.  I did check it at the airport, so can't comment on how it does getting into overheads.\n\nOne of the main things I was most impressed with this suitcase was the design was perfect and it did not once tip over when being wheeled around or standing upright despite me attaching my very heavy eBags mother load backpack to the collapsible handle and an additional regular backpack.  Despite me cramming it (probably) too full and attaching additional bags to it, it wheeled smoothly across level floors and was not too difficult to wheel around London and the cobblestone sidewalks we had to use to get to the underground.  I felt a bit sorry for my travel companions and the amount of trouble they had with the small wheels on their luggage and for how often they tipped over.\n\nI'd recommend this bag to anyone!  It was perfect for my needs, it makes great use of space, the zippers are very strong, it expands well, and fits a ton.

Pros: it does seem like it's going to be extremely durable, even if you are like me and wheel your suitcase many miles on uneven surfaces. if you pack it cleverly, it will hold quite a lot while still being able to squeeze it into most overhead bins (not on the small planes though, and not if you have the expansion compartment open). I LOVE that it has only two wheels, which can be removed and replaced easily with an allen wrench -- something very hard to find.\n\nCons:\n1. The handle defaults to the longest length (which is VERY long), terrible for crowds. if you want it to be a normal length, you have to stop and push the handle back down before you go every single time. very inconvenient if you are trying to get going and out of the way as quickly as possible.\n\n2. the \"main\" compartment is quite shallow, so about about 1/3 of the capacity is in the outside pocket. personally I prefer my suitcases to be deep like a trunk and I save the outside for very slim things, like a laptop. to make matters worse, the interior space between the two bars is filled in. that eliminates even more space that efficient packers might use. (one pro: the suitcase will not tip over on carpet when totally full.)\n\n3. with my old suitcase, I preferred to prop the lid against the wall and drop small things into the mesh pocket. on this model, the zipper is on the wrong side so if you want to use that compartment, you have to keep the lid flat on the floor. seems minor, but really bothered me.\n\nminor things: the tough shell has been warped outwards on the right after carrying it around by the side handle. also the smallest pockets on the outside are barely accessable -- it's hard to squeeze your hand into them. I only use them for tiny things that I rarely need access to, so those pockets seem pretty unnecassary and add bulk to the interior. these details are not a huge deal, but just a bunch of little things that added up.", "summary": "sturdy but design needs tweaking", "unixReviewTime": 1418083200}

Very snug, but it does fit. I cannot see it fitting on anything bigger at all. I've only had this a little while so I can't speak to the longevity, but I don't see why it would break down too quickly. The overall action of sliding a key ring on/off isn't as smooth and mindless as I would like. I'm not saying it's bad, but I've had other holders that are much easier. There are mini ridges cut into the stainless laterally to give the swing-arm a bit of texture. I'm not sure what it's there for other than decoration, but they slow the movement down just a bit. In addition, the area that you must press the swing-arm in order to remove a key ring is very small and it seems like your thumb is just in the way.\n\nThe biggest problem I have is the manufacturing. The metal eems like it was rough-cut out of a bigger sheet but no effort was made to smooth the edges. If you take the holder and moderately brush it against your skin, it'll rough it up leaving white makes, but not drawing any blood. It's not sharp enough to cut your skin or even snag clothing, but the edges are clearly not smooth. This won't be an issue for causal users, but for those with there hands on it 24/7, it'll get annoying. I don't use mine much, I just need to keep keys out of my pocket, so I'm going to use this.

I bought this for my wife for our fifth anniversary. An almost exact version is sold at Sam's Club for over $400 more.  She loved it right out of the box.  It appears well made.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Price was the best I could find\n- Settings seem good - no diamonds lost yet!\n- White gold beats silver and so pendant hasn't turned colors. Note chain is silver.\n- Size was about what I expected - but I always remember that jewelry is not as big as it is on the screen.*\n- Chain is okay(functional), but at some point it is always better to buy a stronger thick chain (white gold) for your loved one's jewelry.\n- Nice box; well packaged - always important when giving jewelry as a gift.\n- Delivered in a reasonable time\n\nCONS (from mine not my wife's perspective):\n\n- Needs good lighting for diamonds to sparkle*\n- Though setting seems well made, reflection of diamonds not as bright as I'd like*\n  Rating of 3.5/4 given due to this.\n\n*Notes: Convert MM to Inches and get out the ruler so you know the size you are getting.\n  It seems that clarity ratings/cloudiness are nearly always low for pendants (here or at other online stores).\n\nOVERALL: This item works for value, as comparable items I have seen are about the same quality. My wife is happy with it and that's what really matters.  I am a little more critical when spending money on jewelry since jewelry is a very high-profit item.  Sam's Club had these on sale at the store at the time of this review, may want to check theirs out or a jewelry store for comparison (compare by clarity ratings).

A big selling point for me was that a portion of the sale will be donated to the American Cancer Society. They need all the extra funds possible. Delivery was very fast. The bracelet came in on a card, wrapped in clear plastic. You could certainly gift this item as is upon delivery. On the back of the card it was on, there is a huge list of different cancers and what color is associated with that cancer. Makes me wonder, who came up with the coloring? The bracelet itself is very pretty. Nice quality. The beads are separated with silver beads and silver, daisy spacers.. The seller stated there are two extension rings to offer larger siz, but my bracelet actually came with three rings. There is also a little, silver cancer ribbon on the bracelet. I really don't see that detail lasting very long...but this bracelet is just a little something for me. So it really doesn't matter much. I would recommend this item and the seller.

The ones I bought last summer were $25, so finding the exact same glasses in different colors for under $10 is a total win!\nThese sunglasses are really flattering on. The two tone is great because they don't look so intense and they give you the perfect cat eye without being overly retro looking like most cat eye sunglasses which aren't very versatile, IMO. Because they are square at the bottom of the lenses, they have more of a modern silhouette and are extremely flattering on my heart shaped face.

When the bag was unloaded on the return flight the adjustable handle was broken.  Now, I have a full set of luggage with the best size and most frequently used piece broken.  The rest of the bags are too large for most trips.  I will probably give the set a way and try for better quality.  This would be a great set for a one time trip.

Needing an emblem for their cause, the men hunted about for materials from which to make a flag.  Some white cotton was obtained for the field, and along its bottom edge was sewn a four-inch-wide strip of red flannel.  A young man named William L. Todd, cousin to Mary Todd Lincoln, drew on its field designs suggested by the company.  First came that traditional American emblem of independent Statehood, a single star, reminiscent of the Lone Star of Texas.  Todd colored it in with red paint made (according to the best available contemporary description) from `blackberry juice, brick dust, and oil.'  Facing the star he also painted in red a crude representation of a grizzly bear standing on all fours.  Beneath the star and the bear were outlined in black the words CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC. ...\"\n\nNow you have a description of the 1846 California National Flag (aka California Bear Flag).\n\nBefore I placed my order, I gave the company a call to verify the colors (mainly that the stripe, bear and star were in fact red in color).  They stated that they were and that the lettering was dark brown and not black, but appeared black unless viewed within a few inches.  So, I placed my order for the shirt.\n\nUpon receiving the shirt, the shirt was not white in color (as even the picture shows) but beige (reminiscent of those old hemp t-shirts).  The stripe, star, and bear are not red in color, but dark brown.\n\nThe product and customer service for this item are an EPIC FAIL.

Since I like it and I'm preparing to travel overseas, I'm going to keep it regardless of the price.  My second beef is, the bag has a 5-year warranty, but the warranty does NOT cover damage resulting from NORMAL WEAR (emphasis is mine).  Does this company expect the owner to keep this bag in a drawer for five years and not use it?  Oh well, as with most of the warranty cards that come with products I buy, I toss them in the garbage to prevent future aggravation.

Nothing available was of sufficient diameter to meet my needs so I \"cobbled up\" an automotive halo powered by a motorcycle battery (made a shoulder sling for the battery) that was half a solution as it did not provide enough light for indoor lighting needs.\n\nWhile searching for other photographic items, I saw this unit in the list of other items on the Amazon search page. I was skeptical (too much experience with failed products) but elected to give it a try. Bought it and received it Aug 18th, did some test shots of my own models and was satisfied that it would do the job I needed, specifically, that I am the \"designated\" photographer for some of our models shows. Note that this unit will work either as a continuous light, adjustable for brightness, or as a flash that provides 2x the output of the \"continuous\" setting. Sometimes continuous produces better results, sometimes flash is better. I habitually check the view screen and switch or adjust output if a reshoot is needed. Note also that the power is provided by four AA batteries; I expected to have to change them often as I've found I have to do with my standard flash units that are good for about 120-150 shots. So, two months later, what is my experience?\n\nIn September, I covered a model show for which I took nearly 700 shots with this ring flash. This is the fourth time I've covered that annual show, the first two times with hot-shoe flashes, the third time with my halo/motorcycle battery lash-up, and this year with this ring light. The photos taken with the ring light are much more consistent and of far better \"lighting\" quality than those of the preceding years. An affirmation to me is that one of the club officers commented that the photos were much better \"this year\" than before.\n\nI've also taken nearly 200 shots of my own models and for other tests (still life, flowers, and detail photos of 1:1 car engine modifications). Occasionally, I've had to reset output or switch from continuous to flash or vice versa, but, overall, estimate a maximum of 5% reshoots. And, to my amazement and appreciation, I still have the original four AA batteries in the unit.\n\nIs there a downside? I have used it exclusively on a Canon 18-200 zoom and the adapter to mount the unit vignettes at wider zoom settings. Vignetting, of course, will vary with the lens used so that is a minimal \"downside\" in my opinion. Other than that, I find this unit to be better than expected and as good as what I hoped to have for many a year.\n\nOpinion: The ring light offer includes a \"Free Floureon Card Reader\" which is a USB2 device. As I was an early adopter of USB3, the card reader is, to me, a superfluous \"bonus\" that I have not used; other buyers might find it useful.", "summary": "Two months after buying, used for nearly 1000 photos, VERY pleased!", "unixReviewTime": 1382054400}

The card sleeve and quick access slots are definitely the major selling points of this product for me. I've found the SIM card slot useful also for international travel but those with iPhones will need a full size SIM adapter in order for it to work.\n\nI've had this wallet for over a year now and visually it has not held up too well. According to their site this is expected \" develop a patina quickly, showing marks, usage and character much sooner\", but still surprising how terrible it looks compared to a wallet half the price. Some people call it character, but to me it ends up making it look much older and worn than it really is.\n\nThe main gripe about this wallet is which I think makes it almost pointless to choose over the Slim Sleeve, is that the note compartment is just barley enough to fit bills.

First off, I'd like to say that the customer service was excellent. I returned this coat and was given a full refund immediately. The leather exterior was soft and really nice and a rich brown. There are two reasons why I returned the coat, the interior was scratchy, off gray, and not any sheepskin I'd seen. I expected something like my Ugg boots interior, soft sheep shearling, cream colored. The fur, or whatever it was, was not sewn so that the seams matched. Instead there were gaps, which aren't a big deal in the interior but along the edging they were quite noticeable. The other problem is when the coat was zipped up, one side in the front was shorter than the other.", "summary": "Not Sheepskin shearling", "unixReviewTime": 1386201600}

I love the look of this. But, as the tag states, Made In China. That's not necessarily a nad thing but their size guidlines must be entirely different than ours.

It's still a little tight at the stomach. Everywhere else is good and loose. In a time when guys stuff is getting smaller such as the XL being the new Small and shirts are getting shorter so they show your crack, I'm extremely disappointed in this. I also got the XXL because it was $40 cheaper than XL. I don't get the reasoning as it's the same seller and fulfilled by Amazon. The way things are going, in 10 years, guys will be wearing bras instead of shirts for as short and tight things have been getting over the years.

It is just wonderful to observe how much she enjoys this.  On the couch, on the floor, in bed, grandma's, in her chair reading, everywhere.\nMaterial is that nice, soft bath towel feel. Stitching has held together after, at least, 30+ washes. Colors have held up.  Her face just positively beams when put on right out-of-the-dryer...\nLittle crown on top is just so cute.\nMy daughter will wear to bed and use in lieu of covers. (we put her in very light pajamas, and she wraps herself in poncho)\nHere is where you must be CAREFUL-\nThere are TWO of these versions out there- exactly the same except the LENGTH.\nDO NOT SCREW UP and buy the shorter one. (Will be a major disappointment)\nEnsure to buy the LONGER one which goes down to your kids knees. (Don't worry- even though it is longer, there is no problem going up/down the stairs)\nI can not emphasize how much of a difference the length makes. (We tried to buy a second one and did not catch it was the short version.)  The shorter one cuts to mid-back and does not allow for the 'wrapped-up, warm, snug-as-a-bug, comfort, security' feeling.  Our (same) kid shunned it. Boy, did we get an education. So, back it went.\nOther than the length, you simply can not go wrong with this thing. After a sleep-over, all the other parents hit us with 'Where did you buy that? (!)'  My kid won't stop talking about (bugging me to buy one) it.\nLittle unhappy about the higher price, but with all things Disney, you gotta pay the extra $.

I am a wife and mom and my purses need to carry some heavy duty things around with it. I was able to fit my large wallet, large water bottle, 2 glasses cases, hand sanitize, cosmetics, snacks, etc. with complete ease.\n-Versatile compartments.

I bought it to perform a show on New Years, and I got rave reviews.  The material is super light, incredibly easy to iron and breathes easy; the only thing I'd warn about is static cling (just make sure to bring a static-removing spray, and you'll be totally fine).  I'm an hourglass figure, and just a forewarning, it DEFINITELY shows off your \"assets\" if you are chesty at all.  It's not vulgar, by any means, but just be prepared to have the ladies on display- I was getting quite a lot of attention from the males in this dress.  Skirt is lovely and falls just below the knee; my one complaint was that I had to break in the sleeves a little bit.  On the first wear, I couldn't raise my arms above my head without the whole dress pulling up and bringing my boobs to my throat, but after a wash or two, the fabric relaxed, & I have much more mobility.  All in all, I LOVE this dress!!!  I highly recommend it!!!", "summary": "So perfect!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1400371200}

If you have ANY stomach issues at all then you might have a problem. However, it is rare to find tops that are cute in any size over 10 so I take my chances with the XL size in Patty Women. I may have to wear a shaper underneath or a cardigan over (in cooler weather). I have tried quite a few items (and had to send back several) but this top is a keeper. It does hug your body and will accentuate your lumps and bumps (if you have any). But I find that it stretches somewhat throughout the day so it is definitely a little forgiving for me. Also, because it has that looser cut in the front, it does not accentuate my middle section as much as some others. I love love love that the sleeves are longer, too. Just make sure that your girls are positioned properly into the bust section for the right look and fit. I find it to be flattering (and I'm a G cup).", "summary": "I do like, but it is tight", "unixReviewTime": 1364860800}

It can easily hold a 10 inch iPad along with all your other necessities.\n\nMy only gripe with this purse is the inside organization. Sure it has one inside zipped pocket, and three pockets on the other side, but it would be nice if there was a divider zipped pocket pocket in the middle of the bag for better organization. If you're in to the cheetah print, you'll be happy to find that in this purse. However, the fabric they used for the interior feels kind of cheap, but I guess you can't have it all in this price range.\n\nAnother feature of this bag is that the top handles are on clips, so they easily fall to the sides of the bag if you're using the shoulder strap. Because the the handles are on clips they are also removable. If you find them too short, you can easily replace them or use metal rings or something to make them longer.\n\nThe long zipper on the outside can easily hold a pair of sunglasses, cell phone, etc. The smaller outside pocket is really only usable for a cell phone or something flat in that nature.\n\nI purchased this bag in gray and my g/f is really happy with the color.

The reason why this is my first review is because this purse was such a disappointment that I feel so strongly about warning others before purchasing this piece. I have been searching for a medium sized bag that can be a crossbody bag without the small straps making it a shoulder bag. Low and behold after weeks of searching I found this purse I actually liked aesthetically as well. I was excited to finally have an everyday purse that was convenient enough to be a crossbody purse which is what I needed, considering I have a one year old I'm constantly running errands with. Personally, if I'm paying $35 for a bag I'm not expecting a Louis Vuitton quality, but I AM expecting a purse that doesn't fall apart within the first 2 days of use.\n\nThe link holding the tassel to the zipper broke as I was leaving a store, kind of embarrassing but ok. I brought it home and had my bf use some pliers to close the link.\n\nLiterally the next day the swivel that holds the strap to the purse popped out as was bringing groceries in and my purse fell off of my body and onto the slushy gross ground. At that point I was infuriated. I tried attaching the clasp to the other metal link but it kept slipping out of the broken gap from the swivel breaking.\n\nI will be returning this poorly made, piece of s**t that is no where near $35.", "summary": "Don't waste your money", "unixReviewTime": 1456185600}

There are magnets on the base bag as well as on the cover. So you won't have to worry about them falling off. The picture for this product shows the whole bag with the cover on it, but each one is sold separately. The base bag is all black, but the covers can come in all kinds of different colors. The covers are also made with different materials. Some of the covers are made from fabric, and some aren't.\n\nI chose the Miche bag because I have different clothing tastes and I like to mix or match what I wear with what purse cover I use. I can wear purple & black and use a purple cover for my purse, or I can wear blue and use a blue purse cover, or I can mix things up a little bit and instead of using a blue purse cover with a blue shirt, I can use my black purse cover while wearing my blue shirt. Black looks good with any color. It looks good with red, purple, blue, pink, white, green, gray, turquoise, teal,.. anything. With the Miche bag, there are endless possibilities.", "summary": "A very lovely product", "unixReviewTime": 1388620800}

I wear a medium and pant size 8 (US), 5'7\" and 170lb, B cup bra.  The bottom fit well enough, but the top was horrible.  There is no way anyone smaller than a D cup will be able to fill up the top.  The bra area has a tiny little padding inserted into it, which is in no way or shape a \"push up\", and it was rolled up and I couldn't unroll them to be flat on my chest.  Also, there is SO much material on the chest area, when my husband opened up the chest piece against my body, they went all the way to my arms.  (There is no elastic that allows the suit to hug your body, and the material is definitely not the tight swimsuit material, the only thing that holds the suit to your body are the strings that tie behind your neck & back.)  There is even too much material around the belly, I think, and let's just say, I do not have a six pack, and have plenty left over from having kids.\n\nI would never consider this swimsuit again!
