The leather works best for all seasons, and its easier to clean and touch up with leather dye.  They have the huge rubber toe cover which is virtually indestructible by my child (never thought I would be able to say that!!!) and they are also very good with overall support and cushioning (unlike converse which is super flat, no support).\nThese shoes are somewhat hard to come across online, though... and just hope I never have a problem finding them for my daughter (8 years old).", "summary": "bet shoe for kid uniforms for multiple reasons", "unixReviewTime": 1481155200}

I opted to repurchase them in XLarge, but after reading the reviews I'm afraid it still won't fit as it should in the chest area. Very unfortunate as the dresses were very cute and perfect for summer outside out that flaw. Most women I know that wear a size large have a full chest :) just saying. It would have been nice for the designers to take that into account.", "summary": "The patterns available for it are very nice, but the design not so much", "unixReviewTime": 1432252800}

First off, it is made a little on the large side. I have small wrists so it is way to big for me. I am going to try to take an end apart and adjust it myself or have my mom do it for me because she is the jewelry lady of our family. I should have just had her make me one like this but i took a gamble and bought this one instead. It is cute overall at first when taking it out of the packaging. I wore it one day for about an hour just to pick my daughter up from school and then back home and it has already lost a piece of it. The little piece between the two owls feet that connect them apparently fell off somewhere and it's now gone. I am going to have to see if my mom or me can also fix that too somehow so that it's wearable instead of having two pieces hanging off of it. Overall i am pretty disappointed in this purchase. I won't be buying another one from them which sucks because there was one other one I was considering buying for my mom after I checked out the quality of this one. It is also a little off center with all the different pieces, which bothers me a little bit because I am OCD. the braided pieces are also a little longer than the rest of the pieces so it makes it sit kind of weird. I think if we take it apart and trim them down a little bit it might be ok. The fact that I have to repair it after only having it for less than a week should speak volumes about the quality of this product though. I definitely would have to say don't waste your money, buy the stuff at a craft store and make your own.

The fit works so well on my body (smaller bust, larger hips) and the quality and craftsmanship is excellent. You won't receive some flimsy polyester blend dress; it is full flannel and the volume of the skirt is perfect. The belt is separate and is optional for your look (the dress does not have belt holders so you won't look silly if you omit it or even lose the belt). The dress is fitted from the bust and rib cage so measure carefully and if in doubt, size up. I usually wear a medium and have a full B-cup but went with a large and it fits perfectly. My only complaint, and it's small, is that the print of the flannel isn't exact to the picture - it is stronger in the brown coloring than in blue. It is still a beautiful dress but expect it to be more brown than blue. The bodice of the dress is fully lined, the skirt is not but it is not needed as it is a full flannel.", "summary": "Beautiful Pinup Dress", "unixReviewTime": 1441065600}

Fast forward to one wear (after sewing the hem line in on both arms - wrist area - more securely), BOTH sleeves became detached in the middle of themselves.\nNow the material is being used as car wipes that I cut out of the un-salvageable garment. I wouldn't recommend at all. The material is soft, that part was nice, but the design is completely cheap. I've never had a garment come apart like that after being unwrapped from it's plastic packaging, then completely falling a part after one wear. I'm allergic to wool, so I highly prefer poly-blends as far as work jackets go, I've never had an issue like this with any of my blended jackets. The sizing chart was accurate in sizing, it fit just fine and again the material was nice, beware of the bad design though.

It was very tight across the shoulders, and it simply wouldn't fit.\n\nI'd recommend getting this size if you're a size 6-8, and wear medium.

Now, on to the hilariousness that happened up top with the girls when I put, er, squeezed this dress over my head.  I am pretty sure the girls think I just had a very strange mammogram.  They actually had no where to go (this fabric has no give at all) and were forced to search for any available space to spread themselves out in a way that resulted in looking like what I can only describe as a grandma who had just been sitting too close to the table with no bra on.  In full disclosure, I have more than a generous helping up there, but I cannot see how anyone with any more than a B Cup (tops!) could comfortably or flatteringly wear this dress.  There also might have been a minute when I tried to remove the dress and became worried I might suffocate with my arms straight up in the air and a ridiculous dress stuck on my face.

I'm kind of a quality snob, so I didn't know how well this pendant would hold up, but loved it regardless because \"I'll love you for always\" is a cute saying we have for each other. However, four months later after I received it and i am still highly impressed! Not only has the pendant itself kept its shine, but so has the chain. Though the chain is delicate and feminine looking, it is still very sturdy, strong, and yet shiney. I also feel as though it is the perfect length, and lays a few inches below the collar bone. I have no anxiety over wearing this necklace in the shower, to the gym, or even to bed. Previous necklaces i have had, and have spent more money for at a fine jewlery counter, would break or rust under these conditions, but this one has stayed strong.

The necklace was packaged ever so carefully to prevent scratching. Thats really important, considering that the pendant has a mirror finish. One little scratch could ruin the whole thing. It makes me so unbelievably happy when sellers take the time and effort to package their items with such care. The necklace also came inside a sleek black box, with a royal blue insert. The blue background really makes the necklace pop! I think its much nicer than your average jewelry gift box. The necklace itself is a sterling silver, mirror finished medallion on a sterling silver box chain. The medallion is quite thick and has a wonderful weight to it. Its so substantial that you would never have to worry about it bending. The lovely engraved quote is antiqued in black. I was really drawn to this necklace, because the quote is so, so beautiful. The font they use is nice and legible too. My only advice is to be VERY careful when you clean your pendant. If at all possible keep it in a tarnish preventing baggie. Its the best way to make sure your necklace stays in pristine condition. I would also only use the polishing cloth they give you. I think its made from some sort of micro fiber. I say this because, from my experience, some silver polishing cloths will leave behind very fine scratches, which can eventually change the mirrored finish of the pendant to foggy over time. Yes, you could always have a jeweler restore its finish, but it is expensive and also becomes trickier when the item is engraved and rhodium plated. It is also possible to use a dip cleaner, but over time that can remove the black antiquing on the quote. A jeweler can also restore that, but, again, it takes a fair amount of money to fix. So, in short, if you take care of it now, you will never have to worry about cleaning it later. All things considered, this necklace is extremely well crafted, has a sweet and sentimental quote, and comes packaged with the utmost care. That is pretty phenomenal if you ask me. I would wholeheartedly recommend this beautiful necklace to everyone. It is beyond lovely.\n\n* While I did receive these items free of charge, my reviews are ALWAYS completely honest. On my profile page you will find both positive and, sadly, not so positive reviews. I will never recommend any product that I find to be subpar. That would be wrong, and my Momma and Gramma taught me better than that.", "summary": "Sweet & Sentimental", "unixReviewTime": 1464307200}

Sterling silver, made in China (I'm pretty sure), this is a match for US tastes.

I am a slender girl (5'7'' and only 116 lbs) with a 34\" bust 27\" waist 35\" hip. I ordered the large and the bottoms just *barely* fit my little booty. I took the crappy round inserts out of the top first thing (I will NEVER wear them) and tried it on and it was sorta loose (I'm a full D cup) but with the coverage I hope it won't present too much of a problem, especially since I purchased this bikini to give me some mobility without worrying about exposure. I have not worn it in the water yet, but the majority of all swimsuit fabrics will stretch a little when they're wet. That will probably mean the bottoms fitting more comfortably, but I may end up getting out my sewing machine and working some magic to get the top more snug. The fabric itself is soft but slightly on the thin side, and there is no lining on the inside of the butt, which is going to be a little scary considering how much white is in this print! The clasp on the back of the top is not adjustable, only the tie at the neck is. The clasp itself is a silver metal that feels very lightweight. I hope it won't break or rust, but it doesn't bend when I apply a bit of pressure so that seems like a good sign so far. If there had been a higher quality version of this that I could find I would have preferred that because I love this design so much, but I'm afraid this is definitely on the lower-end side of quality. Still, I'm happy with the purchase, and I definitely intend to get my use out of it this summer.", "summary": "Size up before ordering! Know what you're buying.", "unixReviewTime": 1459728000}

It has to do with the fact that it's slightly small, but also the zipper its self isn't the best quality; zipping it up without it on is a pain.

Nope ~ they fit perfect!  And with the soft, bit of stretch fabric I am not worried about them ripping and pulling easily.  I just can not get over how cute and really nicely made these are!  I will be purchasing more and would not hesitate to tell someone of any size to order these!\n\nCan't speak for anyone else, but I try to take my reviews seriously ~ I know how much I count on them when I am buying, especially online!

The material is very thin. There is no label in the garment to describe material composition, just the manufacturer Tenflyer. They are rather stretchy, so I doubt they are 100% Cotton.\nThere is no crotch pouch, or ass turn-out.  There is no support. They are flat front and back, depending upon the material stretchiness to accommodate the wearer's body shape.\nI wanted white or red, for a more traditional or early American look, but they do not offer those colors.\nI typically wear Men's Small. I ordered 3 pair of gray Medium, based on the differences in China/US sizes. Most people say to order one size up when ordering from China manufacturers.\nThis uniwear fits a little too snuggly and the buttons tend to pop out when I bend over. I should have ordered Large or possibly Extra Large. But based on what I have received, I'd have to wear briefs under the 'Large' or 'Extra Large' to hold the goods from flopping around. That sort-of defeats the purpose of the purchase. Even in the Mediums, I flip-n-flop, which can get uncomfortable.\nThe button holes are vertical, the wrong direction for proper hold. If the button holes were horizontal, they would stay put better.\n\nI did not 'complain' to the seller, but they offered me a pair of their regular underwear because I wasn't too happy with my purchase/fit. I guess they read the reviews or shipping/packaging statements Amazon is always asking buyers to fill out?\nI have purchased their 'regular' underwear (its all 'go-go' or 'club-wear' stuff). It didn't fit either, and I told them so when I thanked them for their offer.\n\nI am debating whether to order additional pairs in larger sizes.\n\nUpdate; I did order 3 additional pair of these in \"Large\".

Its hard to find a genuine leather bag in this powder pink color. The finish is absolutely stunning. It is made with high quality cows leather and has a smooth, shiny finish. I would not recommend getting this bag wet  it could be treated with leather spray to repel. I think also if you did that and got something on it, you could wipe it down with a cool cloth and air dry and it would stay looking like new.\n\nThe bag is fairly light and has a TON of room. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the outside of this bag! It almost has so many spaces that I don't need to go on the inside! It has a nice larger rectangle pocket on the outside, the back zippered pocket, and a larger front pocket. Then there is the inside, a large space with a zippered divider. It holds my iPad mini, iPhone, wallet, makeup, personal stuff, and even a water bottle. This bag is the way to go if you need organization and space!\n\nThe bag has an adjustable shoulder strap which makes carrying it easy. You can also use the handle for carrying it on your arm. Thats how I carry it. It is a very classic look and makes your outfits look clean and polished from its sophistication. Also the zipper pulls add flare and are trendy! They are longer and easy to grasp and pull. The zippers are smooth and don't snag or catch. Also the base as four metal feet which if you sit it down, it won't get dirty. I LOVE when bags include that little feature since I hate the bottom of my bag getting scratched and filthy!\n\nVERY nice bag with top quality materials and craftsmanship. 5/5 stars!\n\nIf you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a free promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "BEAUTIFUL leathers, cute design, great color", "unixReviewTime": 1447027200}

It is a simple purse and thought it would have a lot more organization to it.  A bit disappointed but I am a purse freak and will keep it.

I have no interest in obtaining product simply because it is discounted and then convincing other to purchase at full price. As such, my recommendations are:\n5 Stars: Meets or exceeds all stated parameters, is of good quality and value.\n4 Stars: Mostly meets all standards, but lacks in one or two minor areas\n3 Stars: Good, but can use improvement or is over-priced for similar products\n2 Stars: Did not meet expectations, needs improvement. Inferior to similar products\n1 Star: Returned Product if of poor quality and manufacturer was unresponsive to finding a solution\n\nAs such, I did receive a discount in exchange for an evaluation of this product and a review but was not compensated in any way. I hope to break down all reviews in a Pros/Cons manner and explain any faults or issues. Thanks for viewing.", "summary": "Nice Basic Shirt with a Dash of Color", "unixReviewTime": 1467676800}

I really enjoy the maroon color, as i think maroon matches my olive skin tone well. It is a button down shirt, and has a really sleek look. The collar is really nice, i love the red white and blue. It adds that little bit of extra flair. I didn't notice any bleed when i removed it from the wash. Colors stayed bright and none of the color ran onto other clothing.\n\nI bought this to wear to work, with is business casual. and i was happy. Definitely runs a tad small after drying so i recommend to air dry. HEr is my synopsis on the shirt overall:\n\nMaterial: 4/5\n  Nice and breathable cotton. It is comfortable after a wash/dry cycle. I really enjoyed that it held onto the colors well. Buttons are solid and stitching is good.\n\nBuild/Construction 5/5\n  Buttons were sewn in well. There was only one loose stitch and it was really easy to remove.\n\nAesthetic:5/5\n  Really snazzy looking shirt. Like i m mentioned before, color is great, collar is great, cut is nice and flatters. It is A\"slim fit\" but to me who is slightly overweight right now, i still felt comfortable in it.\n\nValue: 5/5\n  can't beat the price at 12-14 buckaroos. Really really good deal, get it while its hot!\n\nNote: I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest review and feedback. I take my responsibility seriously and all opinions I have stated are unadulterated and are truly mine. I am in no way obligated, nor am I encouraged to leave good reviews.

But, after a few minutes the first couple times wearing them, I got used to the style and they don't feel weird anymore--in fact, I can hardly feel them at all. They're super comfortable and supportive, and they require little to no adjusting, whether or not I wear them with compression shorts. I wore them to a cardio kickboxing class last night (under compression shorts) and things stayed in place and out of the way of getting squished during all the intense moving, all with almost no need for adjusting. So I bought more that night. This morning I went for a run with them (without compression shorts, just these and running shorts), and, in terms of clothing, it was the most comfortable and supportive run I've had in recent years, probably ever: it was comfortable and felt like I wasn't wearing them; everything stayed in place; I never had to make an adjustment.

These lightweight, comfy pants are perfect for Spring and Summer and have a ton of different ways to be styled. You can pair them with flats, wedges, sandals just about any shoe. I would NOT recommend wearing these pants with sneakers and if you're a shortie like I am then I would suggest wedges  the higher the better as palazzo pants can swallow us.\nCrop tops, long flowly tops, fitted tops  there are so many choices. I personally love how high waisted some of these pants can be so I can wear a crop top. Im not super skinny so it helps to hide a little bit of bulge. I was asked if I would like to review a pair of these awesome pants and jumped right on it.\nAs you can see I chose a gorgeous print. Im not sure exactly what to call this print but to me its very India inspired. Its black pants with white designs and a few pops of red. SO perfect for summer and for pairing with a black or red top.\nNow on to size. I ordered a large because thats as high as it goes and they DID fit, however they were a bit tight on me. I like my clothes fitted but I do like to be super comfy so I would have preferred a larger size just to be on the comfy side of things. The length was perfect for me. I have another pair of this style of pants and they are wayyyyyy too long. You want these pants to be long but not so long that they drag on the ground and get the bottoms all dirty.\n\n*Product provided in exchange for a honest review, all thoughts are 100% my own*", "summary": "So sassy and SO comfy!", "unixReviewTime": 1431648000}

I'm 5'8\" and the hem comes to my ankles, which I like. The long length is nice, and no problem to walk around in, but this much excess fabric in a lounger this length is a serious tripping hazard when walking up stairs with an armload of laundry.\nThis is knit, which was not in the description. In fact, when the description has at least two phrases that include the word \"airy,\" tells you the fabric is \"cool and comfy,\" and states \"...although the skirt is full, it never feels too heavy!,\" one gets the impression the lounger is airy, cool and comfy, and lightweight. With the VAST amount of heavy knit fabric the lounger is, well, very HEAVY. If you're looking for something airy, cool, and lightweight then this is not the right lounger.\nI was busy folding this back up for return so didn't look over the seams and general construction but the quality seems just fine. I'd give it three stars, because quality is pretty good, but I felt the description was misleading so it gets two stars. Now I have to pay to return this and I hate that - I feel like giving it one star but am trying to be objective.\n*EDIT: The return wasn't so bad and I knew the risk by not ordering Amazon Prime. By using the return sticker in the package it looks like the company paid for return shipping and then will deduct $7.50 from my refund; the postage on my end would have been more (it was a heavy package). I think if I'd printed and used the label provided by Amazon on processing my return I would have had the $7.50 return fee as well as paying for return postage.

The design is well above the bottom ruffle. Third, the back V is much much higher than the one in the photo. It is not a deep V at all but it does have the same beaded tassel.\nThe embroidery design is definitely more crammed together than the one in the photo. It's pretty, but almost looks a bit messy somehow.\nI ordered a Large but received a Medium. It fits, but it is more fitted than I wanted. The Large would have been perfect.\nAlso, unlike the one in the photo there are two black cords that hang from either side. These cords have beaded tassel ends. I'm assuming the point is to tie it in the back, somewhat like a halter tie. I guess you could also leave them loose. They don't look bad though.\nI could never wear this as a dress since the bottom ruffle falls right at the bottom of my bum so if the wind blows or I bend over my entire bum would be exposed. For reference I'm 5'6 136 lbs and a 34C and the Medium does fit, it's just definitely more of a fitted look than loose through the torso. I hope the picture helps in giving you an idea of where the back V is and how the front actually looks.\nAlso, it is lined but the lining is that silky, crinkly, noisy kind of lining. I may put in my own lining and remove this one, I haven't decided. It does make it a bit warmer and more like blouse if that makes any sense. For the price it's not bad, but it most certainly isn't Free People quality.", "summary": "Pretty but different than photo", "unixReviewTime": 1432857600}

Compared to bikinis, it's a bit on the tight side, however, it covers my mom belly (two big babies back to back) nicely, and is very flattering, so I'll take the tight. Plus, the padded cups really made my breasts look nice. (Which is a huge plus, because that's hard to find after nursing both those babies.)\n\nReally the only downside is a warning for you all. DO NOT PUT THIS IN THE DRIER! Not on gentle, not on cold air, not ever. Just don't. My husband was being nice and did a load of swimsuits and beach towels for me after I brought the kids to the river for a day. Didn't listen when I asked him to line dry mine. Completely destroyed it. The whole suit shrank three sizes, except the part that crosses over the breasts. That part managed to lose all it's elasticity, so now it hangs loosely, and won't stay in place.\n\nI tried getting it wet and slowly stretching it back out, but it's just hopeless. I'm going to have to trash this one.

Either you get sturdy, heavy, good looking jeans that are murder on your body, or you get comfortable elastic waistbands and paperthin \"denim\" that won't hold up past a few hard wears (not to mention the fact that they're ugly!). I'm a trucker, I love my jeans, but I spend a lot of time sitting so I NEED my clothing to be comfortable. I wasn't sure about these advanced comfort jeans by wrangler, but I loved my cowboy cuts, so I decided to give them a try. Best decision ever.\n\nFor starters, you really won't notice much of a difference between these and the cowboy cuts in terms of how they look. Both jeans sport a natural mid rise waist, seven belt loops, a zip fly and leather patching on the back right side. Unlike the cowboy cuts, though, these jeans are a combination of heavy denim and spandex. The 1 percent spandex allows the jeans to move and shape to your body for maximum comfortability. You'll literally feel like you're wearing sweatpants, but you'll get the style and durability of a great pair of jeans. The hold up very well too. I've put these jeans through hell and they've proven to be just a durable as my more expensive trousers.\n\nA word to the wise: size DOWN when you buy. My natural size is 36 at the waist. With these I buy a 34 (33 in relaxed) and let them shape around my frame. They're extremely tight for a day or so but after that the spandex does its Job you've got a great pair of comfortable jeans.\n\nThey're stylish, flexible and best of all comfortable. I've also loved wranglers but with these jeans right here they've got a customer in me for life!", "summary": "The most comfortable jeans youll ever wear", "unixReviewTime": 1458086400}

Many people will not buy a product until there are a few reviews posted about it. I applaud these companies who put their necks out on the line, so to speak, to reviewers like me who will truly be honest and unbiased. Reviewers like me develop a reputation as well, so we are motivated to remain honest and unbiased. I have given products a 5 star review and I have given products a 1 star review.\n\n5  I love it\n4  I like it\n3  Its okay\n2  I dislike it\n1  I hate it\n\nA good company will look at the reviews and sometime change their product or price based upon the reviews.

On the topic of shipping, the company that manufactures this product is based in China, so be aware, if you are a US customer as I am, there is a lot of wear and tear your package will endure before it arrives at your doorstep. To protect the glasses from this expected rough handling it is encased in a thin cardboard box, and a sub-par layer of small bubble, bubble wrap. The glasses are on the fragile side, they won't fall apart if you drop them, but the wrong kind of pressure will snap them in half. This is a concern because that kind of pressure could very well happen during shipping. Luckily my glasses arrived in one piece, but I wouldn't guarantee they might for everyone. Aside from the risk of receiving a broken product, I must say I am pleased with the quality of the glasses. They aren't extremely durable and I recommend having a hard glasses case for them. They take up a large amount of your face so people with smaller faces should take that into account. The metal is malleable enough to were I was able to gently bend the glasses into a mostly fitting shape for my face, but beware, if you use pliers to bend them it may scratch some of the finish off the metal. Overall this product cost me just under 9$ for shipping and tax included(Standard Shipping). If you have 9$ to spend and want a cool pair of sunglasses that work well to shield your eyes from the sun, and are very fashionable, then I would say these are a worthy gamble.", "summary": "Very Cool Glasses, Work Functionally as well as Fashionably. -{{THIS PRODUCT IS A GAMBLE READ REVIEW FOR MORE INFO}}-", "unixReviewTime": 1454889600}

I may have to get the black one also.  I was originally afraid that the tank would be itchy and scratchy, and that I couldn't stand to wear it but it isn't at all.  It is super comfy and stretchy, and I love how long it is so that it can cover my growing belly.  I haven't had a chance to try it as a nursing tank but the clips seem to work well.\n\nMy only complaint is that when I washed it in the washing machine, the pads shift a lot.  I'll probably need to stitch the pad to the fabric so that it doesn't shift in the wash.  It's probably only meant to be hand washed but I don't have time for that and it's held up pretty well in the washing machine.  Also, when ordering, the product ships from China so it will take a few weeks to arrive...didn't know until it was delivered.

The offer this shirt in many colors: brown, black, green, blue and red. It has a v-neckline with high-low hem with it being lower in the back.

It washes well, machine washable and dries fairly quickly. I don't dry a lot of my clothes to help preserve the clothes fabric and prevent them from fading. This tunic dried with no wrinkling or ironing needed. I did pull a little after putting on clothes hanger wet to dry. So, I recommend for comfort, color, for being easy to care for and for the way it can be dressed up or down all while being very comfortable and stylish.

I was really interested but skeptical of how this would fit. The \"you get what you pay for\" was lingering in my mind as well. Once I got it in before the expected date (which was amazing), I opened the box to bear witness to a really awesome chest strap. Looks exactly like advertised. The leather, although a bit soft, feels good enough to be real leather. The strap adjustment is the best part. I'm an average sized male so I was able to just throw it on and be pretty snug in it, but it feels great knowing I can adjust and tighten the chest strap anytime without it being faulty. The center piece id absolutely astounding. The design is beautiful and industrial. The material is really metallic after flicking it a few times. The only thing I haven't been able to figure out Is the LED light in the center when you open it (which by the way, is really cool, especially when you can keep it locked with a small key attached). The seller(s) were awesome enough to include a battery for the piece; however, I haven't figured out how to place it in there.

If you have to retern anything after the 2-3 week wait, it'll cost you at least as much again in shipping.  Keep that in mind.\n\nWHY DID I PURCHASE THESE?\nI had purchased a couple that were made by JEANSIAN first to make sure they were what they advertised and I was happy, although one was in fact 2 sizes too small, I took it as a fluke with all the 4 and 5 star reviews.  Shopping with JEANSIAN is a gamble.  I wish they were consistently sized because I would have literally spent over a grand collecting every dress garment they make.

The necklace also has a line of diamond like stones in it that shine nicely as well.\nThe earrings look just slightly a bit cheaper than the necklace.  Make note that these are white gold plated, not sterling silver.  They however do not leave any green marks or irritate my ears.  Be aware there is no rubber stop for the back of these to secure them and keep them from possibly falling out.\nThe necklace chain seems durable and well made.  It is adjustable and the clasp is easy to work.  I did have to adjust the stone with a small bit of force to make it hang straight.\nAll in all, this is not a bad set.

The style of the dress is very unique. I love the way it flows and fits to my body. I was afraid that it would be too long or too small since its one-size-fits-all. I am only 5ft, so dresses are usually too long. It touches the floor, but it isn't so long that it is bothersome.\n\nThe dress does tie around the neck/shoulder area, so you can adjust it as needed. The ruffled neckline is just so cute and adds a lot to the style. The sides are kinda low, but I don't really mind it.\n\nThe material isn't the best ever, but for the price, its very nice. Its a thin material and its smooth. It feels nice against my body. The polka dot design is just perfect. Its a great casual or formal dress. I could definitely see myself wearing this on a beach or to a wedding. Its absolutely beautiful.\n\nThe belt thats included is perfect for the waist! It is a woven belt, so it fits just about anyone. Its a nice addition to this dress.\n\nI recommend this dress for anyone looking for something comfortable that flatters the body.

I like to buy my clothes a season ahead so I'm already buying summer stuff and I just know that I am going to wear this quite often this upcoming summer.\nI definitely recommend it and I would buy it again for sure.\n* I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review and unbiased opinion.

The one I received does not have any garment tags at all so I have to take the item description's word for fiber content and sizing. It seems that what makes it a size \"small\" is the waistband. I like the length, I'm 5'4 and it comes right above my ankles which is perfect as I like a  long skirt for sun protection but don't want to be tripping over it. The waistband elastic is uncomfortably bulky and snug, like the waistband on a cheap pair of jogging shorts. The fabric itself is soft and lightweight and it's certainly a flowy skirt but not flattering to the behind - there is a seam that goes down the rear that makes it drape somewhat frumpy and the pockets make the hip area bulkier than an otherwise nice hand to the front. It's affordable, a beautiful color (rich bright burgandy) and would be comfy except for the waistband and since I am not entirely sure of the fabric content I don't know what will happen when I wash it (if I don't decide to send it back). It's annoying to suffer a too-tight waistband to an otherwise frumpy looking garment - the skirt does flow and swirl when I move around and may hang nicer on a taller person.

A 2XL will usually fit OK for me although for some shirts they are too large so I have to drop down to an XL.\n\nThe 2XL was too baggy and the neckline was too wide. So I ordered another one in an XL which was too tight.\n\nBoth of these shirts are tailored like a garbage bag with a hole cut into it for the neckline. The XL had the additional feature of looking like it had been washed 100 times before I received it.\n\nSo as an experiment I ordered another 2XL from Super Hero Stuff. That one fits totally different. The neckline is OK. Although strangely the one they sent me has the same artwork on the front and back which is yet another defect but at least it fits OK.\n\nThis is telling me different sellers are shipping different versions of this shirt.\n\nGenerally I think there's problems with the quality control for these sublimated shirts. I have received some where the artwork is blurry like the shirt was moving around when they applied the artwork. Then I got this XL with the dull colors. I get the impression that some sellers are rummaging through the dumpsters and shipping out the rejects that the factory threw away.\n\nPeople who order this shirt would not know about all of this unless they ordered it from multiple sellers as I have.\n\nAs it is right now I have a 2XL that fits but with the same image on the front and the back. I can't win with this shirt.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wonder-Woman-DC-Comics-Superhero-Wonder-Warrior-Adult-Front-Print-T-Shirt-Tee/dp/B00W2QXMIC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wonder Woman DC Comics Superhero Wonder Warrior Adult Front Print T-Shirt Tee</a>\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wonder-Woman-DC-Comics-Superhero-Ripped-Flag-Adult-Front-Print-T-Shirt-Tee/dp/B0198K0CSM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wonder Woman DC Comics Superhero Ripped Flag Adult Front Print T-Shirt Tee</a>\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Wonder-Woman-DC-Comics-Superhero-Sketched-Adult-Front-Print-T-Shirt-Tee/dp/B00W2QONTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Wonder Woman DC Comics Superhero Sketched Adult Front Print T-Shirt Tee</a>\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Harley-Quinn-Sublimated-Batman-Voodoo-Doll-Tee-Shirt-Medium-Red/dp/B016YJSRWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Harley Quinn Sublimated Batman Voodoo Doll Tee Shirt Medium Red</a>\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/SUPERMAN-SUPERMAN-VS-DOOMSDAY-Short-Sleeve-Mens-100-Poly-Crew-WHITE-XL/dp/B00IABZ204/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">SUPERMAN SUPERMAN VS DOOMSDAY Short Sleeve Mens 100% Poly Crew WHITE XL</a>", "summary": "Not Tailored Correctly", "unixReviewTime": 1452038400}

Fits as expected. Images in non-model photos are true to the colors of it. Skirt is a little short - It falls just below my mid shin and I'm 5'5.5\". The fabric left something to be desired. It was a synthetic fabric, that's for sure; polyester, I believe. But the kind of polyester that's reminiscent of a table cloth, like it could be wiped clean with a damp towel. I do have to safety pin the cross strings in the back to keep the halter top in a flattering position; I could sew it to fix it, but I probably won't, and it will still look good. This dress is not as bad as other reviews say this outfit is. I'm a size 10-12 (measurements 40-32-38, and I carry my weight in my stomach) and the skirt sits high on my natural waist as I believe it's supposed to do. It fits me, but I probably can't put on anymore weight and have it still fit. The top isn't perfect, but the side-boob I get from it looks good and it wears in a way that I will not be flashing anyone. I can't wear a bra with it, not even one of those front-only bras as it would show on the side. It will need to be washed first to get the square packing wrinkles out of it before public wear.

However there are a few issues with it:\n\n1. It is a very thin material so it is pretty see-through on the white part. Definately will need a slip or something else under it!\n\n2. It is less baggy on the top than it shows in the photo. However, I am large chested (36DD) so that isn't a crazy revelation but still a little disappointing.\n\n3. The material is very clingy, I was expecting something more like cotton. However, it is polyester, which is clearly stated in the description now that I look at it. I'm a little disappointed because the polyester clings a little more to my waist than I would like.\n\nSome Pros:\n\n1. High cloth on the top means than even with a larger chest it doesn't show cleavage, even when I am bent over which is a big deal since I have a little one to pick up :)\n\n2. It is literally the PERFECT length for me. I am 5' 4\" and it hits the floor perfectly with a pair of dressy flats. It also fit very well but the pinched part at the waist is not uncomfortable!\n\n3. Bold and clean lines/colors. I was expecting the white to be a little more ivory but it is bright white :)\n\n4. The material means that it doesn't wrinkle and it dries quickly, making it a great dress to wear for a walk on the beach :)\n\nThis dress would be perfect for a day at the beach, a daytime date or just a quick way to dress up your day.

Comparable to Sheri Hill dress. Well worth every penny (we paid $142). Looks very expensive and appears to be well made. No loose gems, has even sewing +. We got the white, and I gasped as I pulled it out of the bag. I couldn't believe how pretty is was. For reference on size, we got the size 4, my 16yr old daughter is 5'3\" and 115lb. Skinny waist, wears size 1 in hollister jeans but larger busted, 32D. The cut of the dress works so well for her figure. I did say it was somewhat large as compared to other dresses we would normally need a size 6 to accommodate chest. The 4 zipped up perfectly. We will have to have it altered at the neck as its too big there. and the she would like the length to be shorter. It comes just to her knees but being 5'3\" most dresses are long on her, so we will pay to have that alteration done as well. The beading/gems are beautiful. They have an iridescent glimmer to them. As the light catches them, they appear to be pastels such as pink, pale blue and lavender. Originally she was going to wear red shoes, red flowers and have date wear tie in red. But the pastel look of the gems wouldn't match that. A pink shoe and flowers would be cute but she is opting for a rhinestone silver shoe and get white flowers to add to the snow princess look of the dress. Will update with pics.

I came up with the Travelog Luggage Compression Travel Socks.  I am a woman and wear a size 8 1/2 M shoes so I chose the Medium size in these socks and they worked out perfectly.  These travel socks have no wool in them which is what I wanted as I wanted to be able to wear them not just in the wintertime, but more or less year around.  They have just the right amount of compression and I enjoyed wearing them around the house so much, that I decided to order another two pairs in the Black shade as well.  They really do make your legs feel great.  They were easy to get on and I feel the quality is great.  The only thing I will worn you is that take a look at the socks in the picture and note how the deeper tone (patterned color) comes up on top of the foot...it may be of some concern to you depending on whether you care if anyone notices it or not, it doesn't bother me since the comfort and quality are superior.  I would without hesitation recommend these Travelon Compression Socks to anyone who travels or needs good compression socks.

I think it says Large on the tag. I usually get a medium in dresses, but a large fits perfectly. I love this dress, fabric and fit. I wore it on a lunch date with a black tube bra just below the elastic chest area as a belt with black heels and a black necklace and bracelet. Adorable and it was a hit with my boyfriend.  I was getting compliments from complete strangers in the elevator on the way to the restaurant. The drop shoulders make the necklace stand out. It's a bright red with navy blue, so if you have navy blue accessories, blue would work too. In the photo, the fabric kinda looks like a little girl dress, but the hemline hits me two inches above the knee and with the black accessories the fabric looks appropriate for an adult. The fabric is similar to that of umbrella fabric as far as thread count and hardness, but does not scratch, itch, and best of all, does not wrinkle. It can make you a little sweaty, so don't wear it in the heat of the summer unless you will be in air conditioning. I also wore it with a denim jacket and black boots and that was very cute too.  Another day I wore it with white Keds sneakers for a very casual look. Add a white cardigan and it makes the casual look very modest. I can see this as a beach dress too. Would definitely buy again. This is going to be one of my travel dresses due to the light weight, wrinkle resistance, easy laundering, and versatility in how it can be worn.  I will always handwash to keep the elastic chest area fully intact for as long as possible.

When I came across this trio, I knew instantly that I had to have them. Not only is this a 3-pack of earrings but it is also 3 different designs as well. I have always seen ear cuffs before but never had the chance to get any. What makes this set unique is the fact that you have a regular earring that attaches to an ear cuff via a simple short chain. So, not only do you have an earring but also an ear cuff. The cuff part, while not technically adjustable, can be maneuvered to your specific comfort level. I don't really like the type of backs these come with but they are easily replaced with whatever you want. All of them looked just like the picture and I like the fact that the daisy set (MY FAVORITE) is a little darker than the other ones.

Another wonderful feature is the integration of metallic threading on the tips of the index finger and thumb on each glove which allows you to easily navigate your touch-screen phone without having to take the gloves off.  I have winter gloves that have this feature, but it is awesome to have the capability to use my tablet and phone while wearing gloves during the warmer months.\n\nEach glove has a beautiful flower appliques, with pearls in the center, on it's outer edge.  I am very pleased with the quality and care they were made with.  The stitching is tight and even.  They are very light and comfortable and will spice up the look of your outfit, while allowing you to easily use your mobile devices.  I received this at a discounted rate, in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion and feedback.", "summary": "You Don't Have To Take These Off To Use Your Touch Screen Devices!

I like how they look like knee highs and tattoos. I also like that there are quite a few different styles to pick from. I've always been fond of star tattoos, so I thought these would be nice to wear. They are pretty cool for a costume or even for everyday wear. They are made from good hose material. I'm mentioning this because I've bought pantyhose in the past that were so thin, and would tear the second my nails got anywhere near them. I have really long nails and although I try to be super careful when putting any pantyhose on, my nails usually end up snagging them pretty badly. I didn't have that problem with these and I would have been pretty sad if that had happened.\nThe color of the \"skin\" area with the tattoos is a bit lighter than my skin, but they still have a nice look to them. I honestly didn't think anyone would think they were real, but someone actually asked me if they were tattoos. I laughed and said no, but they told me the pantyhose were cool either way.\nThey do fit me a tiny bit snug, but I just had a baby a few months ago, and haven't lost all of the pregnancy weight. Normally this size would fit me perfectly. I'm losing weight slowly, so I'm looking forward to them fitting me better in the next couple of months.\n\nAs an avid blogger, I was sent a pair of these in exchange for my unbiased review.

Really nice fabric, a little stretch, but not too much, and it's never clingy. Loose enough thru the waist to hide a tummy, but not enough to look like a maternity top on me at 5'7\". Plenty of room around the \"chest\", too! The length hits me right at the hip socket. Perfect! I don't ever have to worry about tugging it down. The fabric is light enough for Texas summers and thick enough for our spring & fall. The color is just like in the photos, Nice bright blues, deep blacks. It makes my blue eyes really pop, too! I LOVE wearing it. It's really flattering! Washes very well, too. If I had anything sorta bad to say about it, the upper arms are a little bit snug, but I'm got my grandmothers upper arms, lol. God got me back for making fun of the sainted woman behind her back, lol! It won't be a problem as long as you've got normal proportioned upper arms. Regardless, it's still my fave, not a big deal.  I came back to this to buy other colors, but see that only this color is listed now and it's currently \"unavailable\". When they bring this tunic back, I'm buying a duplicate, just in case... I may go to their website, or check their catalog to see if I can find it there.\n\nPlease note... Some critical reviewers say that clothing from Woman Within clothing all fit too large. Do yourself a favor and check their size chart in the description, not Amazon's which is a generic size chart. Woman Within clothing is designed for the bigger girls, not the lucky ones who enjoy a normal weight. On a normal sized person, one who's not a bit over weight, of course they'll fit big. On those of us with a bit of \"cushion\", they've got a perfect fit!  If a man goes to a \"Big & Tall\" shop, do they write reviews stating that the clothing is all too big & tall??", "summary": "LOVE this top!!", "unixReviewTime": 1520294400}

If it hurts your mouth then it didn't set right so put it back in hot water and set it again. Also don't forget to trim the edges of the plastic because you might have used too much. The teeth are not ment for kids but for 14 and up. Yes the teeth are sharp and no you cannot and should not eat with them in.

I work at a haunted house and have a few different pairs of this groups teeth and they are wonderful but it makes me sad to see it get a lot of hate.

Im a curvy petite 52, 110 lbs, 32D usually wear an XS or S. I originally purchased the Zipper V Neck in Small and had to return it because it was SO small, and exchanged it for this black jumpsuit in medium. The black was still a little small on me, but I can make it work. That being said, have you ever put something on and thought to yourself I cant figure out if I love this or hate it? That was my reaction when I first looked in the mirror and Im honestly still going back and forth on the matter. It looks a lot better once you add accessories, but no matter what I did, it still looked a little dumpy in the bum. The neck has two buttons in the back, then is open down to the back waist (something that unfortunately is not pictured). If nothing else, it is very comfortable and was inexpensive. Definitely looks way better on the model though!", "summary": "Almost, but not quite.", "unixReviewTime": 1468195200}

I have  3 of these now and love the fact they  are a heavy weight cotton and while I wouldn't call it a boxy cut, it's certainly not meant to cling to your body shape.  The colors are meant to look a little faded and while I prefer more vibrant colors I  went ahead and ordered 2 more after the first one in navy  simply because of the basic cut and heavier weight.  I am 5'8\", 185 lbs, and short-waisted, carrying most off my weight at my waist.  The size XL is  a perfect fit for me.  The only slight drawback to these tops  is  that after you wash them, the piping at the v-neck likes to curl a bit and if you're OCD like me, you want to touch  up the v'd neck with an iron.  Everything else is perfect.  Also, because they are all cotton I would suggest just a few minutes in the dryer and  hanging them dry the rest of  the way.", "summary": "Woolrich  does it again!", "unixReviewTime": 1452988800}

The White & Black is completely different material (a bit thicker and feels more durable and like it will wash well) than the 2 floral ones, and the medium in White & Black feels somewhat tight and is a tiny bit harder to walk around and get in and out of the car in. I feel like I could use a Large. Not a huge deal. It looks great! With the floral ones, the medium fit perfect. The Large is a bit too big in the waist in the floral prints and also little longer than I like. I can wear them high waisted and the skirt still goes right below my knee.
