It's quite attractive, being finished in a pebbly black leather with off-white stitching ( I don't think it's real leather but it looks great). There are only two programming controls for the three winders, so the leftmost and middle winders will wind in unison, and the right-hand winder can be separately programmed. It is very nice and quiet, accommodates large watches (there's good clearance between the pillows and the cover, as well as between the three pillows). BUT: my largest watch is \"only\" 44mm diameter by 16mm thick. It clears with room to spare, but compared to some of what's for sale these days, that is not really very big.  So don't blame me if your 80mm by 30mm fashion watch doesn't clear the other watches or the glass! :-) I really do not know what the max capacity of this thing is.\n\nThis winder looks good next to my other winders (a Wolf and another inexpensive Belocia, different from this one, but also very nice). It provides a nice clear view of the watches inside, and I can't hear it winding at night (it's about 10 feet from the bed). With three winders, quiet, and a nice appearance, for under $150, you can't go wrong. Five stars!", "summary": "Excellent value in a triple winder", "unixReviewTime": 1443139200}

I am small but have big biceps,  so I have to be careful when purchasing items as this bc usually they fit well everywhere except in arms,  and I then feel restricted,  but when I tried this on,  even though snug fit,  I didn't feel restricted when moving my arms.", "summary": "Runs small.

The length of the arms are 2\" too long-but I can roll them up or scrunch.  Shoulder to shoulder, I could have gone a tiny bit smaller-but I have plenty of room there--and you can't tell at all.

On about day 3 of our vacation to Hawaii, the tab at the end of the zipper run popped off while we were closing the bag. The next day, the entire stitching fell apart where the tab was and shortly after that the zipper pull fell off and was lost; rendering the bag basically useless since you could not close your belongings within in it any longer.

Please note, this is NOT one of those items. I did pay full price.  For the price, you cant beat this ring.  Ive been asked to purchase one as a gift for a friend.\n\nWhat I liked: The ring is stunning.  Especially for the price.  I have received multiple complements on this ring.  The blue Austrian crystal is a deep blue and just stunning.  The clear crystals (sorry, in video I said CZS) around the blue crystal and on the band adds so much beauty to an already pretty ring.  Its very stylish; however, it is also classy.  This ring has a 1-year warranty so should anything happen, you can send it back, no questions asked.\n\nWhat I did not like: As seen in the video, the blue crystal sits weird.  Its not really all the way in the setting.  So, if you're looking at it from an angle, you can see that.  If you're looking at the ring from atop, you cannot.  But, this really is not taking away from the beauty of the ring.  And, for the price, you just cant beat it.\n\nTo sum up my review; I am giving this 4 stars.  I would highly recommend it.

I fell in love the first time I wrapped the wool around me. This Merino wool is HEAVY, and I mean that in a good way. Heating a home isn't cheap, that being said, as many dads do, I keep the thermostat set low for energy conservation and to be easy on the budget during the frigid months. In turn, our 114 yr old, poorly insulated Cape Cod in central Ohio gets pretty nippy in the winter months. Let me tell you, this hand crafted Irish classic keeps me toasty. Sliding this hefty sweater around my shoulders reminds me of a big hug from my, loved and missed, great grandmother. The smell of the wool reminds me of her old sweaters too. Overall, I can't stop gushing about this piece of clothing. This has definitely become my favorite winter garment. My wife loves it so much she has picked out a ladies style that she wants for Christmas. Oh, hope this helps too, I'm 5'9 265 lbs and the XL fits me wonderfully.

The only significant mark against it is the strap, which was just a little too short to easily tie behind my head. I'm a guy and I have a decently large head, but it I easily fit all medium-sized hats. Anybody with a large head might want to plan to use a pin or clip instead of trying to tie the straps. Small-to-medium heads will be able to get it tied, but might need some help.\n\nThe mask itself is lightweight and fit my face pretty well, so it didn't get uncomfortable for a few hours. For most of the night, I forgot I was even wearing it; but after a few hours hanging out and dancing in a warm nightclub, I was looking forward to taking it off. All things considered, I think that's the best experience you can ask for on any mask, so I'm not complaining.\n\nThe material is sturdy and definitely didn't strike me as particularly fragile, but it allows for a little bit of flex. I don't think I would try to bend it because it would probably snap with enough pressure. However, I bet it could be reshaped with heat and maybe some steam. I'm not sure if that would cause problems for the glue, though.\n\nAside from the strap, the only other problem with this mask is how many other people I saw wearing something very similar. It's a very common style and in a dark setting the things that make it look different aren't going to show up at all. If you're looking to stand out, this might not be the best choice, or you might consider further styling the mask after you've got it.\n\nOh, and shipping was super fast.

Now it'll only stay closed if i have both zippers on one side (the left side I think). also, there are holes in the mesh bottle holders. I wish the zipper didn't crap out so easily, took off a star for that.", "summary": "I really like this backpack", "unixReviewTime": 1425168000}

While looking for a kilt, I saw many, many, 5 yard kilts and lightweight kilts with and without the 24\" drop length, but those were as expensive, if not more so than this kilt. For the same yardage, weight, and length on many other sites, it was all but assured that you will be paying quite a bit more. This material is thick, heavy and seems durable (I have only worn it once so far) though I will most likely be replacing the leather belt material as it is thin and I will need to resize it anyway. I wore this on Halloween and I had absolutely no problems staying warm, which I am looking forward to when I wear it again later in November. The colors are nice and sharp, the material, though not wool or particularly authentic, is very comfortable. Overall I think this fits the bill for almost everyone, excepting serious Rennies that are willing to spend the $1,000 plus for true kilts, or even the several hundred. I am very glad I purchased this and am looking forward to showing it off to my friend that has one nearly the same but of much lower quality. If you are thinking about it, buy it.

I ordered a medium and not sure if a large would have been a good fit but never the less there is a little crack exposed but that doesnt really bother me as long as they are comfy. If you have a smaller \"package\" then these will be perfect for you. Haven't washed them yet but I think they will be fine. I may order another pair in a larger size and see if that fits less snug in the front.

The bracelet is big enough on my to where I must fasten it pretty much on the tightest link possible (the one that actually attaches to the bracelet, not the chain) and it still has enough room to dance around and twist so that the design is on the inner part of my wrist. It does run big. The chain is totally unnecessary and also pretty flimsy lol. However, the bracelet is neat. I already got several compliments and no one will likely use the chain anyway because it runs so big. Even if you have thicker wrists, I doubt you will need more than one or two extra links.

I would expect anything shipping from China to run a bit small.\n\nSpeaking of shipping, this didn't take as long to get here as I thought it would. Out of excitement of the price, I placed the order without realizing it was coming from China and was prepared to wait AT LEAST 2 weeks. I ordered it on the 17th and it got here on the 26th.\n\nIt comes all folded up in the packaging, so it has those waves in it. I think that's how it's supposed to look but the folds and waves aren't as light as they are in the picture, if that makes any sense.

It has a removable band which is nice because I like to change it up a little with ribbons and bows and all that. It fits my head perfectly and it has little drawstring things which I'm pretty sure has to do with adjusting the size. I'm not a hatty person I've just recently graduated from snapbacks to artsy hats so I'm not sure if it actually means anything but the tag on the inside has 57 on it.

I'm considering ironing/steaming the hat to see if the warp bubbles will go away (otherwise, they're there to stay). The fabric is made of nice, strong material. A lot more sturdy then I expected. Doesn't really feel like the type of material to get many lint balls, so that's good. The band around the head is removable, so that's a nice option to have. If not, you can just glue/pin it down. The brim is pretty long, so it does a nice job at shading and because it is a simple/minimalist hat, buying it won't be a tragic aesthetic choice (unless you're nitpicky about the wrinkles).\n\nDefinitely fits around my head (and then some). In all honesty, it fits a little TOO loosely for my comfort because I'm always worried a random gust of wind will knock it off my head. I live in a city that feels like a wind tunnel, so I do not want to run after my hat as they do in the movies--it's not as adorable as it looks, people.\n\nRecommended if you: like wearing wigs, want to put your hair up in a bun, or just have fabulously thick locks.

I lost weight and the ring became so loose that I had to take it off when showering, washing dishes, even just washing my hands.  Finally I lost it, much to the chagrin of my wife.  After looking for it for a few weeks, I tried getting a new one from the local store.  They no longer carried the ring.\n\nSo I did what I always do in situations like this. I looked on Amazon.  I was happy to see a similar ring at less than half the price.  I had to measure my finger using the strip of paper / ruler method. I ordered the wrong size, (probably the same size as the old, much too large ring).  I sent it back free of charge, and got a prompt refund, no questions asked. They started processing the refund as soon I dropped the package off at UPS.\n\nThen I received my new ring, one full size smaller, and it fits perfectly. Great quality, terrific service, awesome price! I'll be surprised if these rings don't surge in popularity.  (Then I bought another, just in case!)  Now I have two rings for $30 less than the cost of the original.\n\nHighly recommended.", "summary": "Great ring, great service, great price!", "unixReviewTime": 1464480000}

The issue I have with them though is that many of them need just a touch more of protection before entering public.  All of the slips I currently own are too short for this as you can tell they cut off too early for the maxi styles.  I had the opportunity to try this slip at a discount if I would give my honest review.  I was skeptical at first, but I figured for a discounted price there was less to lose.  I am so glad that I got this opportunity, but this slip is really long and works perfectly!  I was afraid it would be too sheer when I first got the package, but after opening it it was surprisingly concealing considering that it is white and light weight.  I have included a picture of the slip in the package and one of it being held up against the light to show how much it blocks.  I have a petticoat by the same company that you could see the light through both layers together, so I was very pleased when this held its own.

This does not seem to bend and seems to be very durable and strong, it should not break in any way.  The size of the infinity knot is not too big, there is a slight weight to this ring, but nothing that would be uncomfortable.  I gave this four stars for two reasons.  One, I did not get the jewelry pouch that was suppose to come with this.  While not a really big deal, it makes me wonder how accurate the description is of this ring if they can forget a simple thing like the pouch.  Also, the engraving is not really centered on the back of the ring as it appears in the picture advertised.  Again, not a huge deal, but not like it is advertised in the photo. This is beautifully simple, but for the normal price you pay, I expected to get exactly what I saw and was told by the advertisement that I would get.  A good product, just not quite as shown in the picture.", "summary": "Simple, Beautiful", "unixReviewTime": 1464048000}

If you compare to the picture with gloves made of similar (non-stretching) material used in the dress itself, the new gloves might feel mismatched but these gloves are more accomodating now.\n\nFair warning, if you are a stickler for perfectionism, tying a bow on your back with the apron might mean asking for help from your friends to make it *just* right", "summary": "Excellent costume", "unixReviewTime": 1443484800}

XL dress does not reflect size of glove...one size fits some. Now I wear a size 6.5 - 7 ring at the largest, and still had a bit of a time getting my hands in.\n\nChest is actually kind of big on me but I knew it would be from the measurements. Besides, that actually really helps b/c I have wide shoulders. Probably the one reason I was able to get out of it without tearing anything.\n\nSummary.

Yes, the apron is a separate accessory that ties behind you.\nA faux collar, left as an option to be tied around your neck.\nA headband with cute frills and black ribbons.\nA pair of gloves, that is not one-size-fits-all.\n\nWhen you review the list of items you receive, you can bet that it is not your average halloween buy. The quality is exceptional, and you can feel it right in the fabric. From the fabric to the stitching, the dress is absolutely gorgeous. At 5'3, 150lbs, the outfit reaches just above my knees in a perfect fitting, and if it's loose, you can always tie the apron a little tighter to get to your fit. I only purchased this as a fun thing for my Twitch TV broadcasts. My original plans changed the moment I wore it, and I'm sold! Thanks to the length and the relative thickness of the fabric, I can actually wear this at an actual convention with no embarrassment! You don't even need an underskirt, but if you add a bit of a mini tulle skirt, you'll get a nice pouf!\n\nNote: The only draw back is in the gloves, which are not made with a stretchy fabric. Instead, you'll find that it has a hard time fitting most arms. I have relatively small arms and fingers, and I found the XL set barely fit on my fingers and only reached half way on my forearm. However, the gloves are unnecessary. You didn't buy this cosplay for the gloves, and if you did, I'd question your buyer sensibilities. If you still want gloves, I think a proper fitting test in a bridal or costume store for a pair of white gloves will be the better option.", "summary": "\"Cosplay\" Quality, NOT Halloween Crappy", "unixReviewTime": 1421020800}

Docked a star because there was no tracking number, so i had full on anxiety for a month until this arrived.

Once it finally arrived, it was better than expected! I was nervous about the reviews that spoke of a short chain and blobby charm picture, but my necklace looks exactly like the picture and the chain measures 14\" clasped. I got this necklace because it looks like my cat, and overall I'm super happy with it. I even like the antiquey brass finish. Definitely well made for $1.93.\n\n***UPDATE: Not two hours after I wrote this review, I tugged it lightly and the chain broke, two links came apart. I put it back together and chalked it up to ordering from China. Three hours after that, I was bending down to grab something and didn't touch the chain-if suddenly came apart again.

Should I try that?\nSo, subtracting a star because now I have to find something to hang it on, and though that's a first world problem, it's a pain.

To be fair, ours broke because it got tangled in very long, fine hair (after lots of running around), and the attempts to untangle the hair and chain (without a scissors) resulted in breaking the chain. I suppose, in retrospect, I have to say that the blame is not entirely on the chain. It did take a fair bit of elbow-grease to actually pull it apart.

So, if you don't want it there, you could pin it to the front of the apron or not have it entirely. I personally chose to pin it at the base of the tail that I wore with this outfit.\nThe only piece of the outfit I would say looks cheap/tacky is the ears on the headband, which for me wasn't a problem at all seeing as I had my own pair of ears and tail that I wanted to wear with it, so I wasn't going to use the headband anyhow!\nFits very comfortably, INCREDIBLE value for what you're getting, in my opinion.

The set itself has just about every size of spring bar you could possibly need, and many you won't.  However, at the price, it sets the average customer up in spring bars for years to come and is much cheaper than taking your watch to your local jeweler for band replacement.  The spring bars themselves seem to be well made and were easy to install with my new spring bar tool.  One of these replacement spring bars has been  on my watch for about a month with no problems.

I was very pleased that I was able to see exactly where my order was at all times, every few days I was updated about its location and my anticipation grew daily. I have to say I was very excited to see the mail man today knowing he had my package with him. I immediately took it into the house and commenced to delicately open the small bag it came in. to say the least; i was not at all disappointed. I was very cautious about who to buy this from becuase I had heard a lot of bad reviews on amazon from other sellers (I have been researching this product for well over a month) and I have to say that this one was worth the price I paid for it. here are the things I noticed right off the bat: there isn't much neck to this mask, but considering its size, it covers my entire neck and I'm a young woman. it does NOT have an opening in the back like other masks I have seen on Amazon, but it was still extremely easy to put on and it did not pull my hair which was still up in a loose bun. the picture on here is different than the actual mask itself in that the one i recieved is all pink around the mouth area and has no black at all on it. it also has pink shading around the face to give it a muscle effect. the eyes are very bright blue and seem to be of a good quality of paint. the mane is soft and wild looking but not in a matted cheap kind of way. when i put it on there was only a slight latex odor but nothing overwhelming or sickening. the hooves gloves are a nice touch but i have to admit that i was slightly disappointed when i tried them on. they are entirely too big for my arms and slide off easily unless i wear a long sleeve jacket (fortunately i had planned to wear this mask and hooves set with my long sleeve leather jacket so they at least stay on). they don't look anything like the picture though and thats why i feel this product only deserved 4.5 stars (but it only let me rate in whole numbers). the hooves do not have the same level of detail that is shown in the picture but they still add a fun and exciting touch to the outfit. i looked at other masks in local halloween stores and they were not nearly as nicely made as this one. all in all i would recommend this as a great gift for anyone who loves unicorns. i cant wait to start wearing it out and showing it off.", "summary": "ITS SO BEAUTIFUL!!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1412553600}

(1/3 down from the but and 2/3 to the knee) So she felt a little self conscious.

I never write reviews, but I'm hoping this will help some ladies (or gentleman) decide if this is right for them.\nI'm 5'7'',\n I weigh 187lbs\n my bra size (varies depending who makes it, but ladies, aren't bra sizes supposed to be universal??? If anyone can tell me where to get the best bras for the best price on Amazon, you'll have a best friend for life. I've had to give away all 4 that Ive ordered)\nMy bra size is around 36DD to 38D.\nI have broad shoulders, and even at this weight, I have a smaller waist, curvy hips and a nice size rear-end. (I have the classic hour glass figure)\nI bought the 4XL and it fits me perfectly. Even with my broad shoulders, there's plenty of fabric and I can move around very comfortably. I can raise my arms up, wrap my arms around a big man, and completely cross my arms around myself (think of giving yourself a huge hug) without it pulling tight across the shoulders in the front or back, And, the sleeves don't get tight or pull up either.\nI have pretty big boobs right now because of my weight, but it wasn't too tight in the chest at. If someone is a true 38DD, this will fit very well. I think if I went up a cup size it would still fit, but it would be pretty snug.\nI have plenty of room in the waist.\nLike I said, I have a classic hourglass figure, I have a smaller waist, rounder hips and a generous derriere. It wasn't too tight across the hips or buns.\nIt still shows a beautiful silhouette but it's not too tight at all. None of my rolls can be seen, but you can tell I have a figure.\nI could still wear this if I gained another 5-10lbs, but if I lost 10-15lbs, I think this would be too big to wear anymore.\nAlso, the length of this top is proportional to what the thin model is wearing. The sides have slits, too.\nAs far as the fabric is concerned, it's very good material (for the life of me I can't think of what it's called, I'm sorry) it's very well made and the embellishments that are on the middle of your chest and goes around the collar, are very nice material as well, and extremely well made.\nI bought the blue-green tunic, and I have to wear a tank top under it. Because of the way the collar is cut, you can't tell I have a tank top on. You'll have to make sure you wear a tank that's a little lower cut at the top so that it doesn't show.\nI think the pink tunic, however, is a little more see through than the blue one. (I haven't got that one yet and will update when I get it.)\nAll the seams were even, there were no loose threads, and the buttons and embellishments are sewn in very well. There's absolutely no danger that my top is going to fall apart.\n\nI hope this helps clear up some of the confusion on this particular top. Please feel free to respond if you have any questions about it. Ill be more than happy to help if I can.", "summary": "This tunic is stunning!

Dangling stones are a mismatched color, off-center, and do not fit with the main \"opal\"'s appearance. Furthermore, they don't actually dangle but kind of hang awkwardly in space (ring is too tight to allow for actual free movement) Chain was broken prior to arrival and due to pendant design cannot be easily replaced.\n\nNormally I love opals, and I was hoping to get a necklace that goes well with sweaters, but the quality on this is so abysmal that it is going straight in the trash; it's not worth paying the shipping fees to get this item returned.

There is beautiful filigree across the bottom of the central stone and rhinestone detailing all along the sides and bottom of the setting, and a single rhinestone adorns the central dangle.

Wanted to make sure it fit because I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning it if it didnt, I ordered an XXL. The shirt looks amazing! It fits perfectly at this size, no constrictions or areas too tight. Fits over my hips (34\") with plenty of room to move within the fabric. It is sheer when held up to the light but I've worn mine with a matching color bra and it all seems to blend nicely. Buttons are beautiful, and the design around the neckline is very well-made and adds the perfect accent to tie it all together. I definitely recommend this product, now that spring has arrived it's the perfect brightly colored piece for my growing wardrobe. I wish there were several choices for colors- I would order many more. A+ !!\nPS Bust size (to aid others when trying to figure out what size they need): I am a 36C/D, 5'9\" & 139lbs. XXL.

I was afraid that it was broken because it didn't look right, but it was not broken, the plastic baggie was not long enough for it to hang naturally & it had shifted in the baggie. At first, I didn't know what it was, because it arrived in a tiny bubble lined envelope that felt like it was empty & when I carefully opened it, I couldn't figure out what it was because the bow is tiny & looks like a dog bone & the \"crystal drop\" was tucked behind the bow because of the too small baggie & it's a cheap gaudy bead. I haven't tried it out yet to see if the sun will shine through it & make rainbow prisms. I wasn't expecting it to be very fancy, though I have spent less money on better quality jewelry at Amazon & it will be cute on my wall, but, no offense, but I don't think that even a kindergartener would think that this is cute or want to wear it.

It's huge and sturdy and has plenty of room for everything I carry day to day. It looks exactly as it does in the picture, too. My only issues are the floating zipper and the cross-body strap. The zipper does not cover the whole mouth of the bag: instead, it looks as if its not meant to keep the bag closed so much as to keep the bag from gaping wide open when being carried/set down (the shape of the bag makes it 'spread', especially when it's full). This does not bother me (I have plenty of open-topped bags) but what does is the zipper's inability to stay closed. Every time I zip it up, it unzips itself pretty quickly afterwards!\nAs for the bag strap, like many other reviewers to my disappointment I found the clasps to be very weak. My second day out with the bag, I was walking down the street and the bag dropped to the ground, since the metal lobster clasp had snapped. I might have taken a star for that if bundle monster had not been incredibly helpful in sending me a brand new strap.

The bohemian style is perfect for life in Southern California.  I prefer a larger bag and the hobo slouchy style. I don't carry a lot but if I need to I can. I've been throwing my yoga/running cloths in here too instead of taking a separate bag. This thing can hold everything imaginable. Along with my phone, keys, kindle, infinity scarf and makeup bag I was still able to throw in a extra set of cloths for the next day when I planned to stay the night at a friends house after work last week. Totally worth twenty dollars. Has a cross body strap also.  I bought the Dark Tan one (since it was the cheapest) to test it out, and its ended up being a lovely color. Perfect if I need to take it to the beach too. Now I'm going to buy the charcoal one as a travel weekender bag. I go to the desert most weekends for weekend get a ways and this bag is ideal for that. Its not very heavy so not sure how well made it is but good enough to spend twenty dollars on. There is a middle zipper section which I find slightly annoying. Just one big open pouch is perfect for me and easier to find things, so I may try to simple cut it out. Otherwise a very, very cute, hobo style bag with casual  European looking too.\n\nUpdate (03/10/17) So about three days ago the shoulder strap broke on both ends. I tried emailing the seller but I never heard back from the seller. If the shoulder strap is not an issue for you then its fine but I rely on it on a daily basis since I ride my bike around locally on a daily basis. I guess you get what you pay for one way or another,  poor customer service. Still like my bag but it would be nice to buy from a more professional  seller. Just a heads up if you run into any issues within the first thirty day.\n\nUpdate (03/18/17) While out shopping over the weekend, one of the shoulder straps just randomly broke. I was so embarrassed, I had my hands full with groceries then this happens while I'm waiting in this super long line. I'd much rather pay more and have something that is a lot more reliable than this bag. I really liked the idea of it but honestly its just not made well enough to use on a daily basis. I could have my husband fix it but that's not the point. I'm going to have to send this one back.", "summary": "A perfect European hobo bag for the bohemian in you.", "unixReviewTime": 1488931200}

So please keep the price of this bag in mind when you read my perceived \"cons\".\n\nThere were some comments about color on this bag, however, my monitor colors matched well to the item, so the color was as I expected.  It is a dark denim with a washed look to it, darker brown arm straps.  When I first saw the picture, I was attracted to it because it looked like suede to me. However, as I read the title and the reviews, I realized it was denim (more casual that what I was originally looking for), but since I liked the look of the bag, I thought the denim could be nice in the spring/summer.\n\nI just received it, so I can't speak to how well it will hold up, but the interior looks cheap (thin liner material that may tear easily at the seams  if you put anything too heavy in it it, zippers are not very good and the pockets do not look too functional.) However, the exterior looks like it will be ok (there wasn't any sloppy stitching and it was symmetrical -- which would be my main concern at this price.)  The only drawback for me -- and this is completely personal preference -- is that I would have liked it to be a bit smaller.  I was looking for a larger purse, but this is better described as a smaller bag than large purse.  Hard to list dimensions since it is larger around the center than the top and bottom, so I wasn't sure of the sizing when ordering.  So be aware of the sizing when you order, depending on what you want it for it could be perfect size or it could be too large.  I would be great as a beach tote, a small carry-on, yoga/exercise bag, etc.\n\nA final \"con\" is that the zipper does not go from edge to edge on the bag, meaning you don't want to keep your wallet or keys loosely placed within the bag, as it would be easy for someone to put their hand in and grab it since only there is a large open gap at each end of the zipper.  There is a large zipped area inside the bag, but if you don't like going through two zippers to get to your wallet, you may not like this bag.\n\nAgain, I listed quite a few cons, but for $20 I think it was a great deal.

This bag is perfect.\n\nBefore buying this bag I read hundreds of reviews trying to figure out if this was the exact same bag that sold in a range from $21 (inc. shipping) to $57. Measurements varied on listings but that is understandable due to the way the bag is made. The only other question was that some ads said the handle was genuine leather and some said vegan leather. While I'd be happy to have \"vegan leather\" I adamantly did not want a cheap looking leather imitation.\n\nThe \"leather\" is of good enough quality to easily fool most people and please the rest. The fabric is excellent quality and the stitching is perfectly done. Hardware is surprisingly good quality. This feels more like a military surplus bag than a cheap import.\n\nThe one exterior pocket is a little more shallow than I would have made it but it is fine for holding my phone and keys and that's what I keep there. Numerous reviews mention the main zippered pocket in the center of the bag as being awkward and in the way. I could see the reason they thought this when I looked into the bag but in use that is not the case at all. The center compartment can easily hold an 8 inch tablet with charger, wires and earbuds which will in turn hold that pocket up. Alternately, a \"pure organizer\" (which I use a number of - and which sell very inexpensively on amazon) will fit in that pocket giving that one space as much organized carry space as most full bags. Another organizer can fit on either side of that zipper. I am using one and the other side is for my wallet, eyeglasses case and other largish items. (In my attached picture you can see that I have one - green - organizer in the large middle pocket and a pink organizer to one side of it.)\n\nDownside: Nothing is perfect. The pockets on the inside walls of the bag are not very good. The zippered one on mine has a bad zipper. It seems fine but it's open no matter which way you zip it. It will still hold some items away from others but it would be nice if it zipped. I'm happier to have the crucial zippers (outside pocket, center pocket and bag closer - be the perfect ones) The pockets on the other outer wall are really too shallow for much at 3 3/4 inches deep (and not very wide).\n\nThe oddly designed top zipper is not bad. Part of it's odd design is to allow you to stuff bigger items into the bag. (I would rather have magnet closures and I am going to install them.) Even unzipped the bag is not in danger of losing items.  I would not consider making this bag if you offered me $21 for my time and in doubt I could buy all of its components for that price.\n\nI don't switch pocketbooks to match my outfit. I use one bag all the time and I trade out the contents or the organizers I put in it. This is going to be one of my favorite bags, ever.", "summary": "Already my favorite!", "unixReviewTime": 1442016000}

This one I'm writing nearly 2 years later. For a $22 bag, it's pretty amazing. I've been looking to replace this bag for something more \"elegant\", but just can't find anything else that works as well. I am an over-packer. I take everything with me. Everything. I can fit my MacBook Air (13') in its case, along with a 33oz Camelbak Eddy, 26oz smoothie tumbler, and all my \"daily\" stuff (European wallet, 2 eyeglass cases, two \"makeup\" bags, checkbook, snack pack--I have a case for everything and everything in its case). On occasion, there are also books and/or files, then loose stuff (miscellaneous lady things -- mirror, lip balm, business cards, gum, mints, hand wipes, hand lotion, brush, clips and ties) which fits in the interior compartments, plus three sets of keys, two cell phones, and a partridge in a pear tree -- and a second \"after hours\" purse when needed. The bag has held all of that weight amazingly, even lugging it through the airport, hanging it from door hooks, carrying it by the arm straps and cross-body style. It is not perfect (see below), but it is a damn fine, rugged, lasting bag that has not been treated daintily. I wasn't thrilled at first, but I am very happy with this purchase in the long run.\n\nOriginal Review: First, this is a bargain for a $22 bag. No doubt about that. However, my eyes are still watering from the odor it is emitting. The interior slots are too shallow for a phone or pens. Even the interior zippered pocket is tiny by any purse's standards. The middle pocket holds more, thankfully. The exterior zippered pocket is rather large -- just wish that was on the inside. The fact that the bottom is firm doesn't help when you have the bag over your shoulder either by the bag's handles or the larger strap. I would happily pay more for deeper slots and magnetic snap closures, which I think I will look into adding. The zipper closure is more of a gesture than anything else. It takes more effort to zip than snap and, from what I've seen so far, the zipper opens pretty easily on its own because it doesn't go from end to end. Snaps would have been a better design feature, or a hook latch, even it if upped the price.\n\nAgain, this is a great $22 bag. You really can't go wrong with it. And it was received very quickly on free/standard shipping, which is always appreciated. But it does fall short on the standards (pocket/slot depth, closures) that other large bags have, even at a lesser price. And, oh, that smell.", "summary": "Pros and Pros and Cons (Updated)", "unixReviewTime": 1427500800}

Disclosure:  I  was  offered  this  product  at  a  reduced  price  in  exchange  for  my  honest  and  unbiased  opinion.  When  I  do  a  review  I  always  get  one  or  more  people  to  put  their  opinion  in  on  it,  because  people  have  different  likes  and  dislikes  and  I  feel  the  more  perspectives  I  get  on  something  the  better  I  can  review  it.\n\n  I  instantly  fell  in  love  with  this  necklace  the  moment  I  saw  it,  but  with  such  a  low  price  tag  I  expected  it  to  be  sub  par  in  quality.  I  was  wrong  however,  after  stress  testing  it  all  the  way  from  its  chain  that  latches  it  together,  to  the  tassels,  and  the  lace.  I  was  very  impressed  how  it  held  up,  not  only  did  it  hold  up,  the  lace  didn't  lose  it's  shape  through  my  tests.  Even  though  I  loved  the  necklace,  I  sadly  lacked  the  look  and  lifestyle  to  make  proper  use  of  it.  So  to  better  display  it  I  grabbed  one  of  my  good  friends  who  is  in  a  band  and  asked  her  to  model  it.\n\n  Gabbys  assessment  of  the  necklace  was  very  positive,  she  fell  in  love  with  it  just  as  I  did.  It  was  a  perfect  fit,  it  was  too  stiff  and  didn't  feel  scratchy  against  the  skin.  I  even  asked  her  to  give the  tassels a  tug  and  give  her  opinion  on  the  durability  of  the  necklace.  She  felt  it  was  durable  as  well  as  comfortable,  and  was  something  she  would  gladly  wear  it  at  one  of  her  shows.  I  will  most  likely  be  buying  more  of  this  jewelry,  it  has  style  and  comes  at  a  great  price!", "summary": "A great necklace for dressy occasions", "unixReviewTime": 1475193600}

It's exactly what I expected; the ring is a nice size such that it's appropriate for a variety of situations and can be worn as a general ring accessory as opposed to just as a blatant advertisement to the world that you're a G-Dragon fan.\n\nThe rings are of very nice quality and have a comfortable weight to them. The jewel is set well, and the metal doesn't scratch easily. I was worried that it might be plated or would rust/tint/tarnish/otherwise change, but it's remained exactly as it looked when I first received the package. The text is not just printed on the ring; rather, it's carved into the metal and then inked black. Therefore, even if the ink is removed, the carved text still remains. There were a few tiny spots where the ink seemed to be inconsistent (most of it was black, but there were a few tiny spots where the ink seemed to have faded a little bit) but it's not noticeable unless under very close examination.\n\nThe only downside is that the inside of the ring is very smooth and polished, so if it's not a very snug fit on your finger, it's very easy to have it slip off of your finger. I lost one two days after wearing it (from my first order) and ordered a second pair so I could have some extra in case I lost another one.\n\nAs a side note about the seller -- the shipping was much faster than estimated (came about a month earlier than expected). For my first order, everything was fine: I got two rings in a plastic slip, as well as two short black bands for the necklace. No extra gifts/cards/etc., but it was well packed. The second order came with only one ring, but with a different black band/rope for the necklace, as well as a plastic \"jewel\" ring case. I contacted the seller about the missing second ring from this order, and within a few hours I received a lovely email with profuse apologies and a promise that they would ship the second ring ASAP. About a week later (super fast shipping, seeing how it's coming from China!), I received the second ring along with another black band for the necklace and a plastic \"jewel\" ring case. The customer service was absolutely wonderful, and I really appreciate their effort in making up for the accidental oversight the first time.\n\nIn conjunction with the excellent quality of the ring and the refreshingly positive customer service experience I had with the seller, I would not hesitate to order from them again (either this exact order, or another product).", "summary": "High Quality Product & Wonderful Customer Service", "unixReviewTime": 1445990400}

When measuring for a corset, you want to buy one that is actually 4-7 inches smaller than your natural waistline (7-10 if you're plus sized).  You don't want the corset lacing to meet flush in the back when you first put it on, you want to be able to pull the corset strings in order to tighten it around your torso in order to get a snug, but not constrictive, fit.  This is the way a corset is supposed to work. If you buy one the exact size of your waist, the laces will meet completely in the back, but you will not get the effect you want, and it may even seem too big.  You actually do want it to be a little \"too small\".  It will also stretch some as it breaks in, so you also want to allow for that, just like you would jeans or shoes.\n\nSince I am large busted, I was concerned I might not have enough room up top, and also did not want to feel too constricted since this is for a costume I will be wearing all day.  Breaking it in, I found that it does indeed accommodate my bust (47 in) but is actually a little too loose on my waist (39 in), but I'm thinking with help, I could probably get the lacing tighter.  I really should have gone down a size (4X) with this particular corset, since it has top front lacing that can be adjusted to fit.  The ribbing is steel (magnet tested), and overall it's well constructed, although not very rigid. It will work great for my costume!  I will probably buy another in the future.\n\nEdited 9/19/2015:  I have discovered breaking it in that the cup area is not as supportive as I would have liked it to be.  Even tightened, it has a tendency to roll down if you bend over some.  Cinching it tighter just makes it look weird. Not as great as I hoped, but not bad if you're not overly busty.", "summary": "Cup Area Has No Support", "unixReviewTime": 1440547200}

I didn't hear from them til the next day , and I already ordered them, luckily I guessed right. The only downfall is that it fits great now, but I won't be able to tighten it much longer if my waist starts to shrink. So I'd recommend only getting one or two sizes bigger than your normal size.

I really do love this corset though. Very sexy. The g string that comes with is a joke tho. They are big enough to fit an elephant, and the material is very stiff. Kinda looks like one of those sport flag banners kids hang on their walls. Lol. I threw it away immediately. I didn't even give it a chance and try them on.

However, that was not the reason for my return because I could have made it work. The modesty panel in the back is not attached to both sides, so beware if you need to let out the strings it will show skin and not in a good way. I wear a 34DDD, and it did make the girls look good. With the adjustable string in the front, I thought this would be a great feature to have and as I played around with it - I still believe this was a magnificently genius move on the designer. The material is pretty heavy and the design is much prettier in person.\n\nHowever the reason I am returning it is due to gross misrepresentation of the item. There is absolutely no steel boning in this corset. Sure, it has a metal busk, but beyond that there *might* be plastic boning though it's doubtful. To be totally honest, it doesn't feel like there's anything but heavy material where the boning should be. Which will Not help you with waist training.\n\nLastly - if you do plan to purchase this anyway for costume wear, order a size up. With the modesty panel in the back not being attached to both pieces, if it's even a little bit off, it will show your skin all jammed in there and it'll just look terrible. Spend an extra 30 bucks or so on something that's worth it like the Playgirl Black Tafetta Full Steel Boned Underbust Waist Cincher Shaper Corset.\n\nTL,DR; No metal boning, order a size up due to modesty panel, and don't use for waist training as your efforts will be fruitless.", "summary": "Does Not Contain Any Steel Boning - Gross Misrepresentation", "unixReviewTime": 1425340800}

I must say, overall, that the corset is beautiful. Delivery was great. I did in fact order a size larger than my usual, and that helped in terms of fitting around the waist area. I'll admit, I didn't think to measure my bust before considering this corset,  so the top portion bunched up on me as it was too large. I am 5'1, so as you can imagine, the stretch of the torso portion on the corset was too long for me....the parts that fit over the hip area hurt like a motha when I sat down....it dug into my sides and front lower region...not to mention, the portion under my arm pits, kept digging into me as well, and hurt. I found that it was a pain in the butt to try to adjust the back part by myself. So..if you purchase this, and decide that it is a right fit for you, make sure you have someone around to help you adjust the lace in the back. The boning seemed really sturdy.

Since these are cheap I am mostly planning to add additional boning, and reinforce the material if necessary.\n\nThis is absolutely the nicest of the group.  I won't try to suggest that it's anything but an inexpensive corset--but it's a very, very nice inexpensive corset.  I bought it because I think the design is adorable, and I was pleasantly surprised with the quality.\n* I selected a size that is about 3\"-5\" less than my natural waist measurement, and it fits properly.  Wearing it just tight enough to stay on, the gap is about the width of the modesty panel.  There's lots of room to tighten it further.\n* The fabric material is quite solid, a nice firm brocade exterior and a durable-feeling nonstretch lining.\n* The design allows for my busty boobs to stay in the proper place, rather than sliding up or down.  I'm just \"breaking it in\" so far--not tightening it much yet--and even so I am not having to shift it to keep it in place.  Most corsets need the boning to \"learn\" to bend to go around a bust (especially a large one).\n* I have a long torso along with the substantial bust, and the length of this corset is enough to sit at my hips and provide the low back support that I need.\n* The bones are in fact metal; I tested with a magnet.  It's narrow and very flexible metal, but it's metal.\n\nI've found that, with the inexpensive corsets I've been picking up, the corsets with narrow, flexible metal bones are a little stronger overall than the ones with narrow flexible plastic bones.  The metal bones are less likely to buckle outwards unpleasantly, kinking into permanent \"love handles.\"  The narrow bones obviously don't provide as much support as wider spiral steel bones or doubled metal bones, and they don't provide support like flat steel bones do.  But they are more likely to keep the corset shaped the way I want it to be shaped, instead of buckling under pressure and creating a permanent set of love handles in the curves of the boning.\n\nWith all of these inexpensive corsets, both metal and plastic bones, I am breaking them in gently.\n* For the first few days, I wear it just tight enough to stay on and in place.  The bones \"learn\" the shape of a body, develop the right kind of bends.\n* With some corsets I put an elastic back brace around my waist to help the bones develop the right curve.\n* Then gradually tighten it a bit more each day.  This should help prevent the corset from buckling and making boned love handles.\n* When I am able to fully tighten it, it should give me independent support for my boobs and my problematic low back.  Bonus, it should emphasize my waist.  That's not the goal, but it's a nice side effect.\n\nBut of course weak material or weak bones won't be able to withstand tightening, no matter how gently it's broken in,\n\nI may go ahead and add some more boning to this corset, next to the existing bones.  I don't think it will need any reinforcement of the material; the material is strong.  If I start to tighten it and determine that it needs more boning [for my purposes], I'll return and add to my review.", "summary": "Better than I expected, certainly good value", "unixReviewTime": 1412899200}

If you are looking for a pretty corset to wear for fun I would say go for it but if you are looking for something for waist training I would just suck it up and buy a higher quality piece from an actual corset specialty shop.

I have 31 inch waist and it only laced up to 31 inches fully closed.  It felt nice and snug, but that size definitely wouldn't work for me for waist training because it can't go any smaller and it doesn't take any inches off. I had to send it back and need a smaller size. Not sure if I need a large or a medium.  It is very sturdy and very good quality and value except for the lace in back is two laces tied together and they came apart and had to be knotted back together again.  Not a big deal.  I love the material the laces are made of because they slide through the grommets easily (unlike the ribbon some other corsets use).  I do wish the bust areas was bigger.  The laces are available to make it smaller so I can't figure out why it is so small in the bust area even when it is not laced up.  Shipping was fast and the return refund was fast.  I have no complaint about the service or quality.  I just had a different experience than others when it came to sizing.  If you want to actually use the corset for waist training and reduce your current measurement, then I think it definitely runs too large to do that. Perhaps, based on previous reviews, they started making them a little larger than previously.

I don't like the feel of sitting on a thick wallet, and don't much care for the bulge it adds in your pocket. After the \"Leather LA\" wallet from CountyComm ripped, I found this one after much searching, and it's pretty much everything I wanted. It's very very thin, seems to be pretty durable, and has a clear ID window. I carry my license, my carry permit, my insurance card, and three credit cards. It holds it all very securely, and I don't have to fumble to show my ID. I don't often carry cash, but when I do there is enough room to do so if I fold it twice lengthwise, and only carry 5 or 6 bills. I could probably carry more, but it starts getting a little bulky and I don't want to stretch this thing out.\n\nSo yeah, so far so good!

As the Slimmy has started showing its age (fraying and stitches breaking) I looked around to see what was \"new\" in the minimal/slim wallet scene.\n\nThis wallet is even smaller than Slimmy. It's very well-built with high-quality stitching. I've used it daily for a couple weeks now, and it has started to \"break in\", making it a little easier to jam cards in and take them out. I really like the ID window as I need to show an ID pretty regularly, and don't have to fish it out anymore.\n\nIf you want a minimalist wallet, but haven't had one before, the Koyono Slimmy is a great first step: you can put more stuff in it. If you've been around the block with others and are ready to really downsize, this is a great next step.\n\nFor reference, a \"broke in\" Slimmy can fit 4-6 Credit Cards + 4-6 \"Flat\" cards + 20-25 bills folded in half. A \"broke in\" Ragged Edge minimalist can fit 2 Credit Cards + 2-3 \"Flat\" cards + 12-15 bills folded in quarters, or 15-20 folded in thirds.", "summary": "Excellent Minimalist Wallet", "unixReviewTime": 1406764800}

This is a really nice looking bag that you can dress up or down with.  Well made, solid stitching. Love it! I was really undecided about what color to pick, so many nice colors.  I ended up with the gray frankly because it was priced lower and a great value. Turns out to be a perfect choice because this color works well with whatever I am wearing. The dark gray contrasts nicely with the reddish brown leather straps. The item came very nicely packaged with all labels, a dust cover, and lovely new leather smell. I thought this bag might not fit everything I usually carry, but surprisingly it fits everything I need and its better organized than my old tote.  I can find things easier, and the leather trims on the inside pockets prevent them from sagging. The bag runs a little too heavy for me when full, so I will not be buying a larger pebble shopper, but I would definitely buy another color in this design. I recommend this item to anyone who has been considering buying one.", "summary": "Really happy with this purchase", "unixReviewTime": 1464307200}

However, I will go into detail about the sizing and how it fits me. For reference, I am 19-years-old. I wear a 38C bra, I'm 150 pounds, and my measurements are 38-29-40. My hips are very large and my waist is on the smaller side. If I had to label my body, I would say that I'm pear-shaped. I usually wear a size 10 dress.\nWhen I saw that I would need to order an XL, I was like \"No way!\" I've never worn/bought ANYTHING extra large in my entire life, even now when I'm at my heaviest. But I'm glad I did. If I would have ordered a large, the bottoms wouldn't have fit over my large hips. The top, however, doesn't look as shown in the picture. The cups are about an inch apart. I don't know how to work a sewing machine so I'm just going to have to deal with it, but if you do know how to work one, it wouldn't take much effort to sew the cups closer together. I also heard a few of the seams popping as I pulled the bottoms off, but when I pulled them back up to check, nothing had come loose or unraveled.\nI ordered the navy suit with red polka-dots. In the picture, it looks like a lighter blue but in reality it's almost black, which I actually like better. In summation, I would definitely go based off of the size chart and not what you normally wear, because these sizes do run different from normal bathing suits. I'll update this review later if I run into any problems with the swimsuit later on.

I would put this closer to a medium than the large I ordered (I'm 5'  8\" and not overweight).\n\nThe collar is much wider than the picture would lead you to believe, sort of geeky looking.\n\nThe material is thin, which I like, as it will help keep me cool in my humid climate, the main reason I bought the shirt in first place. While the front panels at the buttons do not match (which I knew before buying), the pocket is matched to the surrounding area.\n\nOverall it's an okay shirt for around $22; I gave it three stars because one of the buttons was nearly falling off when the shirt arrived. I had to sew it back on to prevent losing it on the first wearing.\n\n**EDIT** I'm changing my review to one star. After washing, this shirt is misshapen and hardly wearable. I'm returning it.

I read the other reviews and was worried about the costume sizing and the size of the coon skin hat. Luckily as of September 2016 the manufacturer has fixed these issues.\n\n Costume Fabric \n\nThe fabric is a Polyester faux suede. For lack of a better way to describe it, the material is like a thin shammy-type microfiber towel. You know, the ones you drape around your neck that everyone has. It reminds me of that material but it is only suede-like on one side. It is too thin for warmth but too thick to truly breathe properly. We live in Houston and my son started feeling too hot in it during 80 degree weather but it is also too lightweight to provide warmth if it is cold. Plan on layering something under this if you have to trick or treat in anything colder than 65F. The fringe is even thinner and lighter weight but it does look cute. It is prone to wrinkling and crumpling a bit more but nothing a bit of steam can't fix.\n\n Sizing \n\nThe Large size 12-14 costume fit my son who is 4 foot 10, 74 pounds, tall, skinny and wears Boys size 12 at TCP and other popular kid's clothing stores. The pants were long enough to cover his long legs. It might be a stretch if he was a tall size 14 but the costume will for sure fit boy's size 12 and 12 tall. The waist is fully elastic and fit his very thin frame just fine but it would slip off easily if tugged, meaning there is enough room in the elastic waist for various body types.\n\n The Hat \n\nI was very pleased that the coon skin hat that came with the costume looks exactly like the example image and it actually fit my 9 year old! (What a relief because he wanted to be Davy Crockett for Halloween and you HAVE to have the coon skin cap!)  His head is 21.5 inches (youth medium-large size in hats) and it fit him perfectly. I would guess the hat to be a youth large or an adult extra-small. The hats that come with the smaller sized costumes may not fit as well. The hat is a faux fur with a thin nylon lining inside and the tail is also faux fur but stuffed (like a stuffed animal) to give it some dimension and fluffy bulk.\n\n No Additional Accessories \n\nThe bloody axe is not included. The costume shirt is as baggy as shown so you may want to add a brown leather belt, which would be easy to hang a glow stick or flashlight from since dark colored costumes make it so hard to spot children on Halloween night. No other accessories come with the costume except for the hat.\n\nI hope my review helps you to get the perfect size costume for your little adventurer! Happy Trick or Treating!", "summary": "Halloween 2016  Size LARGE 12-14 fits like Boy's Size 12  Coon Skin Hat Fits Youth Heads 21.5 inches", "unixReviewTime": 1475193600}

Let me start off by saying I received these scarves way sooner than I expected. They look exactly as pictured if not better. I am 5'2 and these scarves are longer than me. They can def be worn many ways and of course they make great headwraps. Overall this was one of my best purchases and I would recommend them to anyone. For the price they also look alot more expensive as well.", "summary": "Updated Review", "unixReviewTime": 1463270400}

The negative is the plastic ends of the fasteners (I used two fasteners/button inserted diagonally) protrude on the inside of the thin shirt fabric and scratch the skin. To overcome this issue, I covered the plastic ends on the inside with a mend and repair pressure sensitive nylon patch that adheres to the shirt fabric (can be purchased at a fabric store or fabric department or online) which I cut into a square. Then, I cut another square slightly larger to place over the first patch to give some thickness. The double patch stopped the scratchy skin problem and also is not visible to the eye. You can also trim the plastic ends on the outside of the buttons with fingernail clippers so that the tips of the fastener ends do not protrude over the button's rim.

Nothing was more than $6, so don't expected top dollar quality from the items, but I still think they are nice enough for daily wear in the office or as costume jewelry. With that said, all the necklaces looked as pictured and the colors are pretty exact.
