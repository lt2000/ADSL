I noticed while trying on the suit, the fabric on the bottom looked very thin and cheap (this is not noticeable on top as there is padding to make up for it).

Arrived promptly, too.\n\nAddendum 5/6/17.  I still love these pants but there seems to be a bit of false advertising going on.  I don't think these are true linen fabric.  I used the water test on them and it didn't seep through.  It would be nice to try the burn test but that would damage the pants.  Many of the products now out of China are labeled \"linen\" but are actually polyester fibers.\n\nI'd still recommend them, so comfortable, but that sort of takes the shine off the product knowing they aren't true linen.  Hopefully, one of these Chinese fashion houses on Amazon can come clean and lift the veil on this practice.\n\nOne star deducted.", "summary": "Addendum.

Not only was the material super comfy, the fit was perfect. The materials feel like they are good quality and will last a while too. The padding is enough so that nipples won't show through, and they come out easily for washing. These will most likely replace my bras. I'm attaching a photo of these next to my normal type bra (size 34A) and they look so similar, it's basically the slip on version of my bra.\nI can't speak about fit on other sizes, but I just stretched it out with my hand while wearing it, and it has very good elasticity and will just expand to your band size, and the pads of course will follow.\n\nBecause if you think about it, bras cups usually just \"cradle\" the *sides* of your boobs- they don't cover them entirely. This is what makes the flexibility of this bralette. If you're small like me, it will basically cover them entirely while still preserving the curvature and covering nipples. If you're a larger bust, then its coverage will function like a regular bra - cupping just the sides. So there are two parts: band size and cup size. The limit of this bra would be (1) when the band has to stretch so much that its elasticity will lose tension over time and/or (2) when the cups are covering way less than just the \"sides\" and you feel like you're spilling. I don't foresee any issues with issue#1, as it is extremely stretchy, but I think potentially if you're like a DDD, then the cup coverage might be unacceptably inadequate for you.\nI suppose there is potentially a (3)rd issue with the straps' strength, as some may rely on straps to withstand drooping. Not sure at what point the straps would give out.\n\nWell, I just dissected the theory of the function and build of bras haha, but I hope that this helps conceptualize the \"one size fits all\" for people who are hesitant, and also specify things to consider if they have particularly large busts. I wish these were made in the USA instead of China, just because I like to support local (or closer to local) economy.", "summary": "Exceeded my expectations.", "unixReviewTime": 1467676800}

These Anemone have proved to me I can have comfort, some light padding and a great look all rolled into one.

The clasp is easy to operate and is very strong.

The pearls are very pretty and delicate, and the twisting of the different stands adds a unique visual texture to the piece.\nThe large pearl in the silver setting sits nicely at the hollow of my neck, and moves freely, so I never end up with a necklace that looks off-center haha.\nOverall, this is an incredibly pretty necklace. The sparkling crystals and high-shine silver accent the beautiful pearls in a way I didn't expect. The combination of both materials makes this necklace look classic AND contemporary! I absolutely love it so far, and would highly recommend it to others. I think that this style would suit both young and more mature alike, and look good on any age! Definitely a big hit with me, and I can be a little hard-to-please with jewelry haha. I mentioned how well-made it is, but just to clarify, my son has pulled on this necklace several times, and I have not been worried about it breaking at all. It's made to be durable, and to last.

For the MOST part... So I'm 5'2 and weigh around 125 ibs. I'm pretty small but nit over the top small kind of average. Anyways, when I first got this swim suit I loved it! I wore it to hotels that had a swimming pool with my best friend and her family. It was beautiful and perfect. I'll post some pictures to show you what it looks like. It's a pure beautiful white. It's so cute but it doesn't seem exactly as the same as the picture shows. The picture shows the v is pretty sharp and defined to help define ur cleavage. Mine somewhat created a sharper v neck after the fourth or fifth time I swam in this swim suit. I had to wear it out. It sagged more and more in the middle in between the boobs which helped form the perfect v shape. However it kept sagging more and more each time so I have to tie it tighter and pull the top higher up each time bc if I didn't I would feel a gap of water enter my top when I would swim under and water pushed up against me. So I KNEW my actual tits were showing so I would have to come up and adjust it tighter and pull the actual padding and top up higher. It worked temporarily but I shouldn't have to worry about that. The bottom fits pretty well though. I have a pretty big booty id say and I ordered a small so the bottom showed a little more than what I wanted but I was a gymnast so I was used to the feeling. And it wasn't a lo showing anyways. Definitely shows off my figure pretty well. I think they need to put more work into the top though. Here's some pictures to help you get a feel.

So I would purchase from this vendor again because when I made contact with them it went very smoothly, the dress wasn't damaged or anything, and looked exactly like the picture. 5 stars!", "summary": "I'm 5'3 and weigh 113 lbs so I'm a pretty small girl", "unixReviewTime": 1437436800}

My only comments on quality would be that the boning in mine wasn't placed very well, so that the \"peak\" of the boob on the left side was too high, but the right one was normal, so there was a weird mismatch.  Also, the seam on the right side of the bodice had a little bit of excess fabric, so there was a weird little flap over the right boob.  That being said, these were not flaws that you'd notice unless you were really scrutinizing, and I don't think someone who was just looking at you in the dress would come close to noticing.\n\nQuality aside, in my opinion, the buttons that go down the back are a bit large and spaced out, so it doesn't get that classic effect.  I also thought the sequins were a bit chafing, but that's inevitable with sequins.\n\nLastly, since I don't think it says in the product description, the material is 100% polyester.", "summary": "Great deal for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1460073600}

This is the fourth purse I've ordered from Texas West, and they've all been beautiful.  This purse is well-made of quality leather with embellishments that are securely fixed.\n\nAs an added bonus, there's an awesome matching wallet that is of great quality as well.  It has its own (detachable) thin shoulder strap and wrist strap, so the wallet can be carried by itself, hands-free.  The wallet is roomy enough for a smaller, thinner phone, and has plenty of credit card & other slots.\n\nBack to the purse!  It is just the right size for everything that I carry - not too large and overpowering, and definitely not too small or inadequate.  I put my Epi-Pen in the concealed carry zippered pocket, along with my business card case and another small item.  It zipped up with ease.  In the main compartment, I have the wallet, an asthma inhaler, and other items, and there's plenty of space left over.  The strap adjusts to a fairly long length, which makes it perfect for wearing cross-body.\n\nBesides this purse and wallet being incredibly functional, they're beautifully made!  And Texas West, the seller, has great customer service!  They shipped out the purse almost immediately, and I received it in perfect condition in just a few days.

This is then given to Asuna, who wears it around her neck. Praying that one day, the three can be reunited.\n\nThe anime like others, has gotten a foothold into the hearts of many. So finding anything from the show of quality, takes time and money. For the cheap crap out there, will only end up adding to the overfilling landfills.\n\nWhat I like about this necklace -\nThe teardrop shape is closer to the image seen in the anime. (Thou the true teardrop, is slightly longer.)\nIts colored blue. (Not clear.)\nThe cord, is not a chain.\nIts not some tiny little dot, you'd need to look at under a microscope.\nThere's some weight to the teardrop, but nothing too heavy. That it would become annoying, to wear.\nThe extension chain that's used, to adjust the size of the cord. Is not cheap, nor is the clasp. Both are made well, an should last, if handled with care.\n\nWhat I dislike about this necklace -\nThe cord is some form of rubber. So if you have allergies to such material, which it says on the back of the package. (Some materials may irritate sensitive skin.) Replace the cord with something else, immediately.\n\nOverall, I've only seen one necklace that comes closer to the images below. its either sold out, no longer made or was professional made for someone they love. (The cord was similar to this one, the little upside down Y. That hold the teardrop to the cord, again like the image. All for the teardrop, being slightly longer.

It's my inspiration to loose a few pounds, and this dress does fit small, so it is quite unforgiving!  Word of caution:  do not try it on over your regular clothes!

I've had 5 surgeries onmy back, gained 30+ pounds and am lacking motivation to work through the pain & start exercising all over again,\n\nFor those that say it's poor quality material, it is exactly what the description states, polyester/spandex.  It's what most sundresses and summer dresses are mare of these days..  It's also a $14 dress, the dress is meant to hug your body & be sexy.  And a 3X is not a US 3X.\n\nI hope this review helps.

The plugs themselves seem very sturdy and tough, without being obnoxiously heavy. They're super easy to clean as well.\n\nThe only complaint I do have is that the width of the plugs is pretty thin...and the flare is really subtle, both these things means my plugs are falling out multiple times a day.  All of my other pairs are somewhat thick so that it can hold you whole earlobe. With these ones, my ear always ends up being \"pushed out\" by my earlobe and I have to reinsert them so many times through out the day. And I have pretty normal ears/lobes.\n\nAll in all, I love these plugs and have been alternating between the three pairs daily for the last 3 months ive had them!

The ratchet system is not intuitive.  You would think that you would pull the lever to release the buckle, but instead, you have to push the lever in towards your groin area while you are pulling the buckle out.  The release lever is flush, but it is too flush for me.  When I want my belt to come off, I don't want to be slipping of the lever because there is really no good grip on it.  For best results, plan to use to hands with this mechanism.  not happy with release.\n\n3. The metal piece that your belt attaches to on the back of the buckle is HUGE.  It is a big chunk of metal.  Again, you can't really tell from the pictures because it hides behind the leather, but believe me, its there.  and while you might think bigger is better, I had to use a screw driver to open the latch, which of course scratched the metal.  Not the best design.\n\n4.  Belt leather is average.

However at the end of the day, better usability, functionality, and quality beats a cheaper price.\n\nFor now, buy the Trakline.

They're tight around the waist area and squeeze my stomach in, making me look a bit lumpier than I am. I've decided that the suit is still wearable, but not at all what I was expecting to receive. Yet another little annoying issue is that the black lining on the bottom part of the top keeps folding under the suit, causing it to look strange.

Our dog was having an identity crisis and feeling that she wanted to be more like the resident cats.  We encourage this form of self expression in all of our pets because like any good pet parents we want to see them grow up to be happy, healthy and contributing members of society.  Izzy was pleased with herself as she strutted around the neighborhood and no one recognized her.  She turned the heads of more than a few of the neighborhood kitties who came out to see who the new kitty on the block was.  So we're not sure if she's going to stay a cat but for now she is purrfectly content being incognito in her new feline skin.\n\nThe mask is incredibly well made.  I don't know what we were expecting for the twelve dollars we paid but personally I wasn't expecting anything quite this well made or quite this comfortable.  I don't think Izzy was either.  If she decided to stay a cat for a while I am pretty sure this mask will hold up.  Often when we purchase these inexpensive masks they are good for one or two costuming events before they fall apart.  I think this one will be around for a while.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: If you know someone who wants to be a cat, or a madame or a dominatrix, I think you can't go wrong with this mask.  It is well made and really attractive.  What we particularly like is that the ear are stiff and won't lose their shape any time soon.", "summary": "Great mask for anyone who yearns to be a cat.

It says that the item runs small but I ordered this in XL to fit my top which is a 16 by US standards.  Below the waist I wear a 6-8 US. I would hate for someone to order this in a large size only to find out that the lower half of this dress doesn't match. The material is stretchy enough to be comfortable on top but I was hoping to have a looser fit on the lower have of this garment considering the difference in the size of my chest in comparison to my waist.  The fabric is stretchy but to my surprise it has about an inch to spare.  I thought it would be more roomy.\nIf you have a large chest and do not mind it being widely displayed then no alterations would be necessary.\nI received this today and have yet to have it washed.  There are no tags to indicate any washing instructions.  After I do I will return to edit additional comments.\nOn a positive note the fabric is soft and comfortable.", "summary": "the deep \"V\" in the front doesn't pull together anything like the picture presented", "unixReviewTime": 1439424000}

I might try exchanging the belt and see if I just got a wonky buckle this time around.

The bracelet is beautiful. I tried to send it back but the UPS guy laughed in my face because I guess I cant send stuff to china without a code and Id likely never get one. So I will update this on what the company says, this is about my fourth purchase from them, I have always liked my items and I have never had a issue. If I wouldn't have broke this bracelet right away, I would likely have loved it. it was a wood branch design, how cool. every earthy mama wants a wooden branch bracelet.

Firstly, it came with a nice cloth cover which I completely didn't expect. Secondly, the product itself was very well put together and you can definitely see the quality into every stitch. I personally don't carry cash on me so getting this product was ideal for me. I can only have my IDs, credit cards, and gift cards in my wallet which in essence is all I need. Im also not a fan of the big bulging wallets for several reasons (mostly because they stick out and can be uncomfortable). So if you're looking for something simple with amazing quality for a good price this product is the way to go.

It is made of nice quality and feels like the more expensive suits I own.  The thing that really bothers me about the set is that the bottom really looks more like a size 6 than something marked XXL and with a top that does fit. I can get it on, but it is not something someone that fits into this size would be able to wear.  Each side is adjustable for size and or comfort.  There is also  a white bead on each piece before it is tied.  I believe my 10 year old would be able to wear the bottoms.  The top however is very close to the size they say it is.  I usually wear a 36 c/d or a 38 c and depending on the bra of course that changes sometimes.  The top clasps in the back and ties around your neck.  The clasp has three places you can hook it so it allows for some size variation.  I was planning on wearing it as a bra.  The strap that you tie around your neck has a nice accent of beads.  It is just enough to notice it and look good without taking over the look of the suit.  I think it would help hold the suit up a little but I would not count on it totally.  It did not break any of the stitches for me to pull on it to see if it would stretch out well.  You could also easily cut it off if you wanted to.  I do not see where the push up padding is removable but I do think you could cut it out if you needed a little more coverage.\n\nI received this item free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "... you have a \"bikini body\" then then is a great suit for you", "unixReviewTime": 1464393600}

The fabric is very comfortable and soft, and all the stitching is tight and even.  I could not find a single loose thread even after going over it carefully. That's impressive at this price point.\n\nI'm especially impressed with the sleeves and neck -- great hem work that doesn't feel the slightest bit rough on my skin.  I also appreciate that it does not have a tag -- those are often a literal pain in the neck!\n\nWhat's not so good is the fit. This runs very small. I normally take a large in a t-shirt for a comfortable fit. I got this in XL, but it's a bit on the tight side. I'd estimate that the XL is about halfway between a conventional medium and large.\n\nSome of the tightness is inherent in the cut of the t-shirt. It's cut in a slim profile, plus the fabric has some spandex in it to keep it form-fitting. For me, it's a great t-shirt to wear under a regular shirt, but it's a bit too form-fitting to wear on its own.\n\nIf you get this you'll want to get at least one size larger than your normal size if you want a form-fitting look, and 2 sizes up from your normal size if you want a looser fit. Other than the sizing, zero complaints about this. It's made much better than I expected given the price point, and seems more than durable enough to last through quite a few washes.\n\nRecommended, but with the sizing caveat.\n[Sample provided for review]", "summary": "Excellent build quality; soft and comfortable; runs quite small", "unixReviewTime": 1435190400}

Everything spreads. If you are someone whose job makes them sit for long periods, it can get uncomfortable. And it's a hassle to lift and unhook to find a more comfortable spot. And then when it's time for you to get up you have to reverse the process or your pants sag.\nNot only do they have long belts but they are easy to adjust in seconds. Just lift the buckle for a split second and youve given yourself some breathing room. When it's time to stand just hold on to the buckle and pull the belt to tighten up.\nTo set up, You cut the length you want, fairly easy it can be done with Scissors. And you insert it into the buckle which inserts spikes into the leather.\nThis part is a little tricky because you have to press the spikes in really hard and requires good force. At the same time you have to hold the leather in place or it might get hooked on akward  when you want it completely staight.\nI recomend doing a \"practice run\" on the first length before cutting it. And then use a flat screwdriver to reopen the latch (Wich it will need some force as well.)\nAt first I thought it wouldn't hold because of my size, but it's been doing a great job.\nThe belt is smaller than I thought but it works great and it's strong enough so no problem there.\nWhen you put it on you just slide one end through the buckle as you pull it through and it clicks until you find your required fit.\nThe buckles are really cool looking too. There are many to choose from. However, They cannot be changed with other special buckles that aren't of the same kind because it is essential to the whole belt structure.\nSo far so good.", "summary": "Great for Big Dudes", "unixReviewTime": 1535068800}

We measured her and followed the Amazon standard sizing chart and the fit was spot-on! When you measure: 1) use a sewing measure tape, and 2) do NOT pull the tape snug; hold it as loosely in place as possible without falling. When measuring bust, measure right at the nipples. For waist, measure the smallest point of your waistline, typically right at or just above the bellybutton. For the hips, measure the largest point of your hips/derriere. The only thing I can say about those who had problems with fit is that they were likely cheating on measurements and are diluting themselves, which is understandable. Some larger people will call the measuring tape a liar because reality can hurt sometime. Know someone else with a larger build who bought a similar dress from the same maker. Loathed the measuring process, but took advantage of the custom fit service and contacted seller with her measurements. She was thrilled and the end product looked marvelous.

This is only for those who are a size 2, or maybe a 4 with 10% bodyfat. Kind of ridiculous for something free-sized in my opinion. I'm also not tall, but if I were to wear this as a high waisted skirt I would get arrested. I actually prefer short skirts, but this comically short. I asked my husband how it was in case I was being too critical, and all he could say was \"Wow. Cheeky!\"\n\nIf that were the only issue, it would probably give it 3 stars, but the stitching is horrible! After ten minutes of wearing it, around the house of course, a large part of the hem fell out. This was 10 minutes of not really doing anything except sitting on my couch doing homework. Not exactly strenuous or tough on fabrics.\n\nSo, basically, if you want to purchase this for a child or preteen for dress up, this would be okay. If you actually want to wear this as a skirt, look elsewhere.\n\nI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review", "summary": "Too short, too small, too poor of quality.", "unixReviewTime": 1449360000}

The fabric is really nice. Hems are straight and there were no loose threads or anything like that. I'm really disappointed that it is too small for me.

And I mean all of them. I looked at the measurements, and even measured myself just to be sure it would be fine. It is 'one size fits all' after all. I looked at the pictures others have uploaded, I considered that it is coming from China so it might run small, but, like I said, the measurements made it seem like it would fit.\n\nIt came a month early, estimated arrival being a month and a half after ordering. So that was nice. And I ordered wine red, which isn't exactly the same as the picture but still pretty nice. Those are the only good things. It is super, super small. And short. And it is a mini skirt, so I did expect short but. This doesn't even cover my butt and in the front was only an inch lower than my crotch. I'm a 4-6 pant size, about average. I tried just having it at my hips instead of my waist and. Mother of muffin tops. Seriously. I've never worn anything that looks worse on me. And the material is really weird. Like... Grandma's curtains/tablecloth type material. Some kind of pattern. It's soft, but I hate how it feels. The inside is a typical silky cotton that's inside most casual skirts. No loose strings and the hem is even though. The waistband does stretch, but the elastic isn't attached and twists as you're pulling it up.\n\nSo. Really disappointing. Maybe it'll fit my ten year old little sister though. Overall, I wouldn't buy this unless you're really, really skinny.

When they arrived, I was actually quite surprised by how comfortable the material is, however, they are a lot longer than I thought they were going to me. First, they fit great. Not loose, not too tight, but when I button them up, they go above my belly button and the legs are much longer. They look shorter on the model. I needed a short pair for under the tutu as it was just supposed to be a way to hide my underwear from the sheerness of the tulle and the tutu was quite short so we didn't want anything that would be longer than the tutu. These shorts met mid thigh for me. I have other shorts in the exact same size and they were no where near this big or long. Nothing a few alterations can't fix. We just rolled the legs up a bit and the waist rolled down. It's just weird how they fit me. Nothing wrong with the shorts themselves, I don't think. It's just that all bodies are made differently and they just personally fit me in a weird way.

My baby is 7 months old and the romper totally looked to small but when I tried it on her, there was plenty of room. Even great for Christmas or Valentines with a long sleeve onesie and tights underneath! It does seem like its a little scratchy but with a few runs through the wash, it softens up a bit.", "summary": "Lady in red", "unixReviewTime": 1510444800}

Near the right pocket, there were blue speck of blue dye and a hole near the right underarm area. Tight around the arms, and a bit too small for these to be pulled up high for high waist shorts.

No ironing or anything was needed. The softly fitted waist is insanely comfortable with no binding or tugging. The soft fabric hugs my hips and bottom and drapes beautifully to ankle length (Im 54). I love that I can adjust the length just by adjusting how I wear the skirt at the waist  folded over and ruched at the waist and I can pair the skirt with low heels, sandals or flats. Folded over minimally and I can pair the skirt with heeled boots.

I got the swimsuit in a size large and it fits just right. There is no excess fabric, and it feels a little tight due to the elasticity of the fabric, but then again I think that's how swimsuits should be. You want it just tight enough so that there won't be excess drag when the entire suit gets wet. The fabric of the suit itself feels like a nice sturdy material. It has a bit of a funky smell when it came out of the bag, but it should go away with washing. The suit looks exactly like the pictures, the reds and blues are very distinct and bright against the white backdrop of the swimsuit. But I think the halter straps and the criss-crossing ribbon in the back could stand to be a bit longer. The halter straps are long enough to tie together, but not long enough for me to make a neater bow out of it, I can only manage a half bow with one loop. The criss-crossing ribbon for the back is long enough to just serve its purpose, but I think it would look more flattering with a tad bit more length, like how it does on the model. Also, the ribbon has a hole about an inch wide in it. It is not that the ribbon ripped, it's more like the seamstress forgot to sew up that part of the ribbon after they turned the fabric inside out. It's a problem easily remedied, but I'd rather not have to go to the trouble of fixing a clothing piece that should be brand new. Asides from that minor problem, the rest of the seams on the swimsuit all look neat and tidy. When putting on the suit, you really do want to loosen the back ribbon as much as possible before pulling on the suit so that you don't tear any seam by accident. The shape and cutting of the swimsuit is nice and structured, however, the breast cups are stiff. This is good for covering up the nipples, but due to the stiffness of it, the cups have a set shape that may or may not conform to the shape of your natural breasts, and this is before you put in the extra padding that they provide. Overall, I do enjoy the shape, material, and pattern of the swimsuit.

Also the matching belt broke the night of the wedding so now I'll have to figure out something else to wear with it next time around since the belt loops are very obvious. I wish they had an option for replacement belts or a spare buckle.", "summary": "Super cute, overall good quality", "unixReviewTime": 1460851200}

The other reviews were right! I did though, got the expedited shipping because I am going to a Anime con in Dec 2-4th. I ordered this on November 11th and got it on November 17th, even though there was slight delay with my payment method. I notice on the picture that the zipper on the jacket looks white BUT its not! The Jacket and shirt is a little big even though I ordered a small. My measurements are (in inches) Waist 34-35, chest 34, bust 33-34, torso 28-29. Height 5 feet and 3 inches, a total of height 64 inches. You can Google or Bing converter to turn inches to cm. Also the shoes are too big for me but I can manage. Can't hardly tell unless I shake my foot or try to run, I have size 6 or 7 USA size feet anyways.\nNeedless to say, I admit I am a bit of a odd shape for my height and I didn't email the seller of my measurements.\nThe pockets you see on the front of the jacket? Fake. Just for show unlike in the anime where Kakashi keeps his scrolls in there. They are just nice puffy fake pockets with buckles on them. They do pull of the look of real pocket, then again I am being picky. However, I ADORE this cosplay. Nothing but a little rolling the shirt a little and tuck here and there can't fix. It does come with a white back pocket you can attach to a belt...Yeah, gotta find a belt to got with this.\n I will say it is warm, like a cozy hoodie, perfect for December Anime Con yet, I do hope the don't have the heat up too high inside the convention center.\nRecap: Great and fast shipping, awesome quantity and quality, the large kunai can cut thin plastic and looks AWESOME.

Yes, yes, a million times yes! A quick disclaimer before I get into the review: I received this bag in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. But I promise this is a completely truthful review: I LOVE this bag.\n\nFirst off, I've never seen anything like it. It's absolutely adorable and petite without being too tiny. I fit all my things (which include excessive just-in-case products like lotions and hand sanitizer and tissues and more) in there with room to spare. I do wish the pockets were just a tad bigger, but I fit my mirror and headphones easily into one slip pocket, so I can't complain too much. It comes with two different straps: a short handle one and a longer crossbody. I put both on my bag because I just couldn't decide, and it still looks great! The hooks aren't unsightly and they're subtle and blend in well with the antique look of the metal. The black color looks faded and vintage, which I absolutely love. The straps are detachable so it can be used just as a large clutch on its own.\n\nI LOVE this bag, I love it. It's so unique and cute and the absolute perfect size for me. I love its shape and size and appearance. I'd pay $ 50 for a bag like this, it's amazing. The detailing on the metal is precious and the straps are sturdy and thick, so comfortable enough to tote around all day.

The interior lining is anchored to the body so its does not shift around; however it doesn't have feet and will not stand upright when empty.\n\nThe only drawback is that the lighter colored bags can pick up spots; however, that is easily taken care of (I have literally rubbed ink marks off Dooney leather using only my finger).

Prior to ordering this bag I was using a combination of purses and diaper bags and backpacks to lug everything around with me on a daily basis. As a busy mom of two who is always on the go, I am constantly finding myself switching from bag to bag to find something that will hold everything that I need while providing comfort and style. Until I received this bag I had yet to find something that worked for me.\n\nThis bag is a game changer for me. It's large size makes it perfect for storing not only my purse's contents but also important things that I need to have with me at all times for my young infant. In addition to my things and my son's things, I can toss a water bottle and an MP3 player in it for my almost 5-year-old daughter and still have extra room.\n\nThe handles on this bag are very nice and strong and are comfortable to wear on your arm or up against your shoulder. Included with my bag was a long strap that can be attached so that you can wear your bag across your shoulder and chest. I choose to use the long strap because it helps keep the bag on my body without me having to constantly readjust it, and also because this is the most comfortable option for me.\n\nThe leather used for this bag is obviously genuine and of very high quality. It's dark brown color combined with it's gorgeous style gives it a classy look that would look good on anyone with any style. The inside of the bag has pretty olive green material with a zippered pocket on one side. There is also a zipper on the top of the main compartment so that you can keep it closed to ensure the safety of your things.\n\nI have been using this bag daily since it arrived in the mail. I am extremely pleased with it and can not think of one single thing I would change about it. I will be sure to update my review if I do end up running into any issues with it. I would definitely not hesitate to recommend this bag to family and friends.\n\nPlease note that I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions within this review are my own and I am in no way obligated to leave a positive review.", "summary": "Beautifully Made, Nice Size", "unixReviewTime": 1469491200}

I was very skeptical of the $9 price tag, but I was trying different minimalist wallets out. The first thing I will say is that this thing is very durable and well-made. I don't know anything about leather, but this leather seems to have broken in very nicely. When I got the wallet, brown leather was an option, so I got that. The leather is now much darker and has a bit of a shine to it. Something interesting is that I kept a credit card in one of the front pockets and the leather broke in around the credit card number, so there's a permanent indent around the number and name. No, you cannot read the number. It's kind of cool. I have not had any issues with the wallet. It hasn't even begun to show signs of wear. I've scuffed the leather a few times and the scuffs eventually fade away. Somebody mentioned the cheap interior material, but again, I've had absolutely no problems. And if you are confused about the pockets, yes, the wallet has two pockets on both sides. I keep 4 cards in the outer pockets, and 3 in the middle. 7 total.

Not only are the roses PLUM but the back ground is a dark dull gray rather than white or light grey as it's depicted on the product page. I can't even detect the stems on the roses that are suppose to be green.  There is a distinct difference between the colors plum and purple  that the average person can discern.  Thus, one would expect a company that manufactures and sells products in various colors to know that difference.  Therefore, to label this as purple is, to say the least, a  misrepresentation.  The curtain is also pretty thin so I'm not impressed with the manufacturing of the item either.  With shipping and handling, I paid $19.99 for mine.  I received it 16 days after placing the order. The company I received this item from was \"Happy_Store Storefront\"  and apparently is located outside of the USA so returning the product would be too costly.  Therefore, I have no choice but to keep it an give it away.

I did not even have to steam this dress.\n\nIMPORTANT tip: Get a petticoat with metal hoops to make the dress flare out more at the bottom.

When I was sixteen, I vowed to never date a guy who wore animal shirts. I didn't think much of it at the time; it seemed totally reasonable to me. Truthfully, it was just another arbitrary characteristic on a long list of personal deal breakers for potential mates. along with crooked teeth, a lack of compassion, and an affinity for putting mushrooms on pizza. (Plus, I had just seen that episode of The Office where Michael and Dwight try to throw a party in their hotel room, and Dwight wears a shirt featuring coyotes howling at the moon.) But alas, life (or God - however you want to look at it) has a funny way of setting you on journeys you never dreamt you'd embark on. Indeed, I went back on my original promise and started dating a guy who owned not one, but two animal shirts (that I know of). I know, I know: I shouldn't have compromised my values for a guy! Boys are perpetual sources of disappointment! But you know what? When we were in high school together, I was a nerd and he was on the football team, so yeah, you better bet that I wasn't going to miss this opportunity for a dramatic turning of tables on high school stereotypes. Anyway, I digress. Long story short: I started dating this guy, I fell in love with him, I eventually discovered he owns animal shirts (specifically, unicorn and tiger shirts), and for better or for worse, I still love him despite the questionable wardrobe choices. I bought him this shirt on a whim, and let me tell you: it was worth it. The shirt itself is great; it's soft and fits true to size. There's no visible fading, either. The only complaint I have (though it's nobody's fault but my own) is that I can't find all thirteen ducks! At first I thought maybe the illustrator only put twelve ducks in the picture just for kicks and giggles, but I don't think anybody would be evil enough to do that. Though it was difficult at first, I've had to accept that maybe I just wasn't meant to find all the ducks. So, is it worth the price? Yeah, sure. Is it worth the crippling disappointment of not being able to find all thirteen ducks? Eventually I got over it. Will your animal-shirt-wearing boyfriend love it? Yes, yes he will. If this ever comes back in stock and you're on the fence about it - get it.", "summary": "life (or God - however you want to look at it) has a funny way of setting you on journeys you never dreamt ...", "unixReviewTime": 1484092800}

I would not recommend buying this for an adult unless the adult has skinny fingers.  It is adjustable, but I was afraid I was going to break it if I pulled on it too much.  I think it will work out great for a little girl that is old enough to wear rings.  I purchased this to go in one of my daughters Easter eggs for her Easter egg hunt.  It is the perfect size for an Easter egg surprise.  I bought her lots of fox shirts to wear next fall so this will go perfectly with those!  I should add, that the ring is absolutely adorable.  The only finger I could wear the ring on was my pinky finger.\n\nI received this product at a discount for my unbiased review.  All thoughts are my own.  I hope that my honest opinion was helpful.

I was scared it wasn't going to be worth the price and I was just going to be buying an overpriced costume jacket, but thankfully it's actually a decent jacket. The material is actually quite nice on the outside, and soft on the inside (as others have pointed out in their reviews).  The embroidery on the back is really great too.\n\nThe sizing is definitely a toss up, but thankfully I was able to look down at the comments and the size guide in the description to pick the right size! DEFINITELY READ THE SIZE GUIDE IN THE DESCRIPTION. I normally wear a safe medium in US sizes (I'm around 5'8 and 135lbs), and thought I could have gotten away with one while reading the other reviews. After reading the size guide I realized I better play it safe and get a large, as I was willing to live with it if it was a little big. But it actually ended up fitting perfect. It might be a little short on the arms, but eh, I'll live.\n\nThere's only two things I can knit pick about. The first being the pockets, they aren't sewn down into the jacket so they kind of awkwardly stick out, but they can be easily sewn in, so I'll probably do that myself in the future. The second isn't really a downside, it's just a little precaution, which has to do with the embroidery in the back, it appears to be a little fragile, so I wouldn't go too crazy in the jacket.", "summary": "This jacket is really quite great.

I don't know. I guess I was feeling impulsive or something. When it arrived I was pretty disappointed.\n\nThe figurine was painted poorly. Either by a rickety machine or by a small child, it seems. It's just not well done. Not at all. I feel like if I wore it people would think it was something my kid made for me. It is basically made from the same materials as one of t those little green army men. That's about the same size too.\n\nThe best part of the whole necklace is the chain it came on. The chain is very nice and of a much better quality than the charm it comes with. It's weird, but that's how it is. I will likely just discard the little figurine and use the necklace to hood something else.\n\nI don't exactly know what star rating to give it. I suppose it did have the character in the listing. It's the same weight and length it was supposed to be, so that's all the way it's supposed to be. I just want prepare for the \"cheeziness\" of the thing. I can't rate it highly if I'm going to be truthful.\n\nI was fortunate enough to receive this item at somewhat of a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review of it.

Also if I bend over to pick up my purse or bag MORE than half my butt would show! The top of the romper is also a problem, it's extremely HUGE, when I'm wearing my bra. I can't go braless because that looks sloppy to me, but also with the top so big and floppy I would not have very much coverage, and there is no built in support. Also this is with the straps tightened/ shortened as much as they will go. I'm used to tops fitting me not having so much material that it exposes me. I am disappointed, judging from other peoples comments, and the pictures provided I definitely thought that this would be a winner.

I found it to be an awkward length for my frame, too, although on some other body type it may work fine.\nLastly, I guess I did not expect the fabric to also be so synthetic feeling. It's exactly like wearing a tutu. It's feels like more of a costume piece than a skirt you'd wear out in the public.

The same goes for the band, it started cracking pretty soon. My wrist has a circumference of 7 inches, the band fit well, with room to spare.\n\nI noticed while trying to wind it that it didn't work like other watches where you leave the pin down to wind, and lift it to adjust the time. Instead, I lifted the pin to adjust the time and it also wound the mechanism. Turning the pin in the down position did make that faint clicking \"winding sound\" but ultimately did absolutely nothing. This seemed like a failure in the manufacturing process rather than intentional, but I'm not sure.\n\nThe hands are pretty difficult to distinguish from the background. It's ok to tell the time in daylight, but in a darker environment (or if you have poor eyesight) it's pretty much useless. It doesn't glow in the dark.\n\nThe body of the watch is a half inch thick, which is quite substantial, so be advised.\n\nIt kept time perfectly during the day, but it wouldn't keep running through the night unless I gave it a few good shakes before I put it away (to activate the winding mechanism that responds to movement). I didn't mind having to set it to the right time whenever I wore it though, but if this is a problem for you, again, be advised.\n\nThe band also started cracking pretty soon. I was actually considering getting a new band for it, but unfortunately the watch stopped working yesterday. I'm not sure what broke, but it won't even wind anymore. I didn't wear it every day, but I'd say I've worn it for about half of the time, so that would make it a month and a half (maybe two) of active usage.\n\nBecause of this, I would definitely advise against buying this as a present for someone.

Meaneor are a new name to me.  When I was asked to try out some of their clothes, I took some time to choose because, at first sight, their styles looked a little plain in the photos; but put a body inside and things change!\n\nThe fabric has a lot of stretch and reminds me of activewear.  It's a cotton blend with what feels like spandex, lycra or polyester.  I thought I would dislike it because I prefer natural fabrics, but after wearing it for a few hours, I found it very comfortable indeed.  Perhaps not the best thing for a really hot sunny day, but ideal for fresher summer days and the mid-season.  Also ideal to wear indoors where air conditioning sometimes goes too far.  The upside of the stretchy fabric is that it moulds very flatteringly and you don't have to worry too much about getting the size right.  I normally wear a US size 8.  I looked at the size chart's bust measurement and asked for a Medium (despite the fact that my bust is 34-35 and the M is supposed to fit 31 inches).  It feels like it fits me well.  A bigger size would be looser but these styles are made to be form-fitting, so I prefer to stay close to my normal size.\n\nHowever, the best surprise was the length, it's actually perfect for me (I'm 5'8). Bravo, Meaneor, for getting it right!  There is nothing more disappointing that ordering a long dress to find that it misses those crucial few inches at the bottom.  At least, if something is too long, you can always take it up!  The elegant simplicity of this maxi dress evokes a Grecian tunic, and the distinctive rope tie gives it a slightly monastic feel.  Cleverly designed to adapt to a variety of shapes.  Someone with a short upper body (like me) can tie the cord tightly at the waist, creating a blousey effect to the top; if you have a more conventionally long upper body, you can tie the cord more loosely to sit wherever it falls naturally on your waistline.\n\nMy chosen colour, an elegant steel grey, makes it casual, although it can be dressed up a little. The racerback cut at the shoulders contributes to the perfectly moulding shape.  I wear a sports bra underneath, or one of those multi-position bras with straps that criss-cross at the back.  Despite the low price, finishing and stitching are good.  There was the odd loose thread but you can snip it off in a second.  The care tag is pretty standard:  Wash below 40C, hang to dry, low iron, no bleach.  It did wash well and does not need any ironing. I will be wearing this one a lot!", "summary": "Finally, a maxi dress that is long enough for me", "unixReviewTime": 1437004800}

It is great for work, a wedding, a party, church or when you just want to look nice as you go about your day.  It pairs great with strappy heels for a more casual effect or you can wear it with a solid stiletto and achieve a more polished look if for a special occasion.  The material is not see-though at all, rather it is a cotton blend that has a stretch and give.  Since it has a back zipper, it is easy to put on and to get off.\n\nThis dress will make heads turn as it makes you look fabulous instantaneously and hugs your curves perfectly!  Great for those who are heavy chested as it will extenuate your curves nicely, but not excessively!  An absolutely lovely piece. I got it in a small since I am a size 2/4. The dress fit as expected. I stand at 5'1\", and the bottom of the dress hits just below the knee area making it perfectly appropriate for work, event or church.  I now own every color combination because finding a dress that slims you, I'm 125 with that bulging \"mommy\" tummy that won't leave no matter what I do, and makes you look polished is very difficult to find.

I have a very innate, intuitive connection with crystals. When mine arrived they had good energy, which is sometimes unusual when receiving stones that have been through many hands and equipment. This can include something as simple as someone handling the stones who is feeling particularly negative on the day these were put together. It can range to something much more complex also, such as if they were packaged by a machine or even the post office equipment. As well as many steps along the way, from the beginning to the moment you have them in your hands. So I was surprised that the lot of these stones did have good energy to start with. I enhanced this by cleansing them with a method known as smudging. I followed that cleanse by charging these crystals with a large crystal cluster. In this case, quartz. I will then follow up when the moon is full again. There are several ways to get these crystals into their optimum abilities. I am very happy with the feel of these stones. I feel as if they have great potential. These pendants are larger than what I expected and are quite attractive. Most likely I will replace the waxed cord for something that has a more spiritual feeling. All in all, I believe this is a very good purchase. Especially for someone who has a connections with stones and crystals or someone who would like to share the potential they have.\nI received these pendants at a discounted price for my honest review.

The waist does tie but is also a little looser than I would've liked. When I think pin-up wiggle dress I think of something very form fitting. The only real issue I had that makes me glad I ordered the 8 was the zipper. I may have struggled to zip the 6, but I'm sure it could have been done. It gets stuck, especially around the waist ribbon, so I found it works best if you twist the dress so the zipper is on the front, zip it past the ribbon, then turn the dress back to normal and continue zipping. The fabric is fairly stiff cotton. Perhaps with a wash it'll soften up and shrink a little in the right places.

I'm only slightly disappointed because I really expected the color to be a little deeper shade of blue? a little more vibrant for sure. But that's nothing some rit dye can't fix, the mesh part doesn't stretch at all and I think that may make the white material that is the mesh part appear a little more opaque (it may be tulle), again I'm sure if this is an issue fabric dye could remedy it. For the price I don't think these issues are a deal breaker at all the suit is still super cute and feels like a quality product. The solid part of the suit has some nice stretch to it, it's actually solid and covers what needs covering. The padding on the top is minimal and not removable but it seems to do it's job. I followed the chart provided by the seller and decided I might wear a L but not having too much experience with Asian sizes and after reading the other reviews I opted to order the XL. In american sizes I wear a 32D and usually opt for a large in swim tops for coverage, and wear a 4 in jeans usually purchasing a medium for swim bottoms, I found this top to feel a little snug just from lack of stretch in the mesh area I think but it appears to fit nicely, I find the bottoms just slightly too big but without experience purchasing similar items just because I don't find it super stretchy I think I would recommend ordering the larger size if your on the fence at least you'll know you can get into it then, I do find this to be a quality product and it's so inexpensive if alterations can't be self made, it may be worth it to have a seamstress fix any issues you have or just order 2 in different sizes, it may be handy to have a bigger or smaller size on hand for potential weight loss or gain.

I like the design, but the materials used kind of ruin the anklet. It did arrive quickly, though.\n\nThis is  a pretty anklet. The silver chain is a bright silver beaded chain - it is very dainty and seems it would be very easy to break or kink. From my experience, that type of chain is sturdier than it appears, but it could be problematic to have it on an anklet. There are eight little decorative balls on each of the two chains, and the chains are fused together at the ends. Of the eight seamless balls, four are smooth and four are stardust sparkle, and all are about 3-4 mm. The two chains have alternated designs - one is stardust, smooth, stardust, smooth, etc. The other is smooth, stardust, smooth, stardust, etc. They go well with the bright silver chain. The balls are kept in place with silver crimp beads. It's a good way to keep the balls in the middle of the chains, but definitely not very a very sturdy method to use on an ankle bracelet. In this case, the crimp beads appear clumsy and ruin the flow of the design.\n\nAll of that said, my biggest issue with this anklet is that it is WAY too small. It isn't even close to the stated length measurement of 25cm/9.84\". Mine measures 21.1cm/8.3\", 23cm/9\" with the extension chain. At less than 2cm, I'm not real sure what is the point of the extension chain.\n\nBottom Line: A beautiful anklet that will go with anything. It is about 4cm/1.57\" shorter than advertised. It would fit much better as a large bracelet - due to the chain used in the design, it will not take much punishment before breaking, and this type of beaded chain is a difficult fix. The crimp beads are clumsy and will likely break with little wear. I like the design of the anklet, however, I think the chain is too dainty to last as an anklet...especially when the overall length is 1.57\" shorter than the seller states. (And I was being a little generous with my measurements.) I would not buy this again - which is too bad. Had it been made with materials that are a little sturdier - and the RIGHT SIZE - this could have been an amazing little anklet that I would have worn daily. Designed as it is, there is no way this will stand up to daily abuse.", "summary": "Nice...But Falls Short", "unixReviewTime": 1441238400}

The person who became spokesperson for Oakley sunglasses was using his table saw one day, wearing his Oakleys, when the saw kicked back and hit him in the face.  The Oakleys were destroyed, and he had a scar in the middle of his cheek and his forehead, but his eye was fine.  His Oakley sunglasses saved his eye, and possibly his life.\n\nSo, with this in mind, let me tell you about these sunglasses.  I get them in the mail, and they're okay; they're what I wanted.  I mean, they were a bit inflexible when it came to folding up for travel, but what new pair of sunglasses isn't?  Of course, I have them for a week; I'm careful with them, making sure that they are left, unfolded, in a location in my room where they won't be scratched or damaged in any way.  Then, one Saturday I pick them up as I prepare to walk out the door to go somewhere, and I accidentally drop them.  They fall no more than two-and-a-half feet to three feet to my very, very padded carpet -- the same carpet that had enough padding to protect from damage my laptop, which I had dropped onto this carpet side first only a week previously -- and what do they do?  They break.  The cheap, plastic part of the frame that goes over your ears breaks right off.  Note: it doesn't FALL off.  It doesn't just pop out of place.  It BREAKS off.  What a piece of garbage.\n\nI suppose I got what I paid for; if you buy it, you will too.  Bear that in mind when you see that price and consider it a worthy buy.

He has worn it around the house and has found it to be very comfortable.  It's lightweight and perfect for warmer weather.  We're getting sub zero in Ohio right now so no hiking yet in it.\n\nMy son does wear a mens small to medium and this just fits him.  So, it does run small.  I would say to go one (maybe two) sizes bigger. This isn't the kind of material to shrink from my experience because his Scout pants are made somewhat the same.  The stitching seems very durable, I've tugged at the seams and you can't pull them apart like I've seen in cheaper made clothing.  I had my son do a lot of stretches and leaps to make sure it didn't tear easily and it didn't.  The buttons seems stitched on nicely.  The sleeves have a zipper to attach the arms.  Worked perfectly.  Easy to take on and off.  I found no issues at all with that area.  The zipper seems of good quality, doesn't pull apart when pulled on.\n\nThis is a good, versatile shirt that can be worn to both outside events as well as more formal events.

I love this dress. It it's very comfortable and light. Can be dressed up or down with the right accessories. From other reviews I ordered up a size as it runs a little small (ordered a large). I'm a medium (pregnant or not) 5'4 muscular build with a little \"junk in the trunk\" (25 weeks pregnant now), which the large appears it will fit until the end of my pregnancy in July. Although dress is stretchy which is great, don't be fooled. The dress is little thin so ordering up a size will help in the dress not being as see through especially as the dress stretches the further along you get. Common mistake is people order a size smaller to make them feel good... I get it, gaining weight stinks no matter what, but just because a garment stretches and you can get it on doesn't mean it fits. So know our correct size and order up one in this product. Also a nude maternity shaper would help for any maxi/body-con/curve fitting dress to smooth out any areas that you are a little uncomfortable with and also help give your belly a little support as well as minimize the appearance of the dress looking see through. Hope this helps and congrats mommas on your babies!", "summary": "Know your normal size & order up one & you'll love the dress", "unixReviewTime": 1491782400}

The dress was garbage.  The back of the dress/ skirt is shorter than the front! Also there is a band that goes around the circle of the dress and it doesn't align meaning the dress wasn't cut properly when it was manufactured. It's like a factory second.  Also, the fabric and color is completely different than the size medium.\nAll that said, I like the dress so I ordered another small to see what I get and am returning the other 2.

Somehow I wound up buying not one, but 3 identical gowns.  I decided to keep all 3 since I wanted more anyhow, and I didn't figure a newborn was overly concerned with whether or not he was wearing the \"same\" outfit repeatedly.  Given that he was just born a few days ago I have only worn them on him a couple times, and of course they have only been washed once or twice, so I can't really speak to their durability - although they feel extraordinarily well made.  I absolutely love everything about them: the softness of the fabric, the mittens which can be folded over if needed, the bottom of the gown which can be closed or left open, and the fit of the gown.  My little guy is very little - he was only 5# 14oz at birth and came home at 5# 9oz, so we don't have many things which actually fit.  These gowns are cut in a way that allows him to wear them better than any of the others I have, as they are more slim fitting.  They are still crazy long in the arms, but I figure he will start filling them out soon.  That being said, these gowns have a good deal of stretch, so I expect they will fit for quite a while, and the 'slimness' shouldn't be an issue when he does have a little more substance.  I fully intend to buy a few more, including some 3-6 month ones.\nI would highly recommend these gowns as an absolute must have for anyone expecting a baby!!", "summary": "Goumikids baby gown = Perfection!", "unixReviewTime": 1486684800}

The definitely need to be broken in at first because they are kind of stiff but afterwards they are much more comfortable. The only problems we had (and I would have rated it 4.5 stars but that is unfortunately not an option) was that both of the front pockets were accidentally sewn together (in different spots)  with the lining of the pants, so you actually couldn't stick your hands in the pockets. Easy fix for me because I do know my way around a needle and thread, but annoying nonetheless. Also ALL of he rest of the pockets are quite small, even the cargo pockets.

If you pick the one that says Asian #/US # than the US size number is accurate. I wear a size 31 waist and I ordered a size Asian 34/US 33. The waist did indeed fit like a 33 waist. The rest of the pant fit perfectly. The extra waist is not a bid deal as I can use a belt, but if I could do it over I would order the next size down.\n\nAnother reviewer complained that the pants fade after the first time washing. I took a picture before and after washing and drying the pants and I did not notice any fading. I am sure they will fade over time as the colors are very dark and vivid, but all my clothes fade with time. The pants feel great. I love the inner fleece liner. They appear to be well made. These are great for cold conditions. I wish the outer material was not cotton as these would make great snow pants. I have not tried these in snow as I live in Texas, but plan on it eventually.

Not so great for moving around.  The outer material seems like typical camo pants. Although I noticed there were loose threads all over the place.

It hasn't been terribly cold but cold enough and these pants worked just fine for walking in the woods.  I just wish the fit were a little looser in the legs because it felt like they restricted my movement.  The pockets had stitches through the opening to keep them closed.  They were easy enough to break open but it seemed like the pants would be easy to rip a stitch on.

Good thing I did. At a full size larger than the rest of his pants, these pants are just barely wearable. He would have preferred an additional size up. Because they are so tight, he doesn't feel that he has the range of motion that he has in his other similar pants. To the positive, the lining is comfortable, the heavy cotton does a pretty good job at keeping dry, but it is cotton and will have its limits. Heavy weight material has done a fair job of fending off the briars when walking off the blazed trail. All in all, he says that they are pretty good, but won't be his first choice, partly because of the sizing and mostly because he prefers his other options, which offer greater range of motion.

At first I was confused because I thought that it would come with a pouch to put it in but after a minute I realized that the zipper pouch inside the big part of the backpack actually folds inside out and you stuff the backpack in it!\n\nI will say that a basic photo showing this would have been nice but I put a video together showing how to do this in case anyone else is a little confused when it arrives like I was. When this is all folded and in the pouch it is approximately 7\"x7\" which is not big at all and it is very light.\n\nThe backpack itself is made of an easily cleanable (what feels like) waterproof material. The zippers and straps seem well stitched. The pouches and the straps are a padded mesh material and the pockets on the sides have elastic on the top so your stuff doesn't fall out.\n\nI can see us using this in our camper so that we have a backpack for hiking trips or day trips but where I could see it being most valuable is if you were going to an amusement park.  More specifically if you were flying to a certain park in south-eastern USA where a certain mouse lives. Trust me; you don't want to go there without a backpack and this is the perfect size one for something like that.\n\nMy son thinks this is his so I'll let him think that for a while but this is way too cool of a pack to give to a 3 year old. :-)\n\nI received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review but that in no way swayed the above statements.", "summary": "What a cool concept for a backpack, folds up to a 7\"x7\" package with a wrist strap!", "unixReviewTime": 1440720000}

She did say however that since they are not advertising that they do, plus with the 'dot' side frames (which obviously don't protect you from UV), her opinion is she would think they probably do not. I have had cataract surgery with my lens replaced in my eyes so UV is no longer a concern for me. I do like the glasses a lot. Not so much for driving around in town though due to the side shields, which do not go on and come off easily w/o a very small Philips screwdriver.

As a frequent buyer of vintage- and retro-style dresses on Amazon, I have to say that this was the first absolute dud I've ever found. In person, the ACEVOG Vintage 1950's Floral Spring Garden Party Picnic Dress Party Cocktail Dress is a garish and cheap green, not the midcentury kelly green like the photo displays. The \"sweetheart\" neckline actually hits up at the collar bone, and the \"full\" midi circle skirt barely flounces. The \"cotton blend\" is very polyester, which gives it a bit of stretch and give, but doesn't allow the dress to flow like it should. I wore it once, bravely, and felt like I looked terrible. After one wash, the cheap hems flipped out and the fabric crinkled and shrunk into a tiny mess that now hangs on a modest hanger in the back of my closet. There are great retro dresses on Amazon.

Nothing will take the wrinkles out. the material is stretchy which is nice but it lost its color and it wrinkles so it just looks terrible. also after the first wash, the hem started to roll up and just stay rolled, no amount of ironing or hang drying or gentle tumbling would get this dress to even out.
