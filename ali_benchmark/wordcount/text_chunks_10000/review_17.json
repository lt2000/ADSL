Her ears were already swollen and trying to get these to close with an active infection was tough. I almost threw in the towel to let her ears close up and try again in a few years, but she begged me not to. Once I DID get these to close, we diligently cleaned her ears three times a day applying anti- bacterial each time. After a few days, we saw a difference. Now, a couple weeks later, her ears are almost completely healed. I would recommend these, but put them in either right away, or as soon as you see a problem. If little ears are irritated already, don't put your little one through it. Also, some review I read said 6-7 year old were wearing these.

And although it is snug (I weigh about 135 and have a little tummy), it is not uncomfortable!  I actually got a compliment from someone that I am intimate with, so I guess it is sort of sexy for hanging around in the house in. I plan on ordering the black as well! Five stars!!  But if you are busty, DO NOT order the large; the same goes if you are chunky. (no offense)", "summary": "Love it!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1426723200}

This gamble paid off, and wow, I am in love and very impressed!\n\nThis top is well-made, delicate-but-sturdy, sexy, and the size I chose (Medium) fits me perfectly, just like the model (though the sleeves are a little shorter on me, hitting the wrist, as I am a very tall woman with very long arms).\n\nAbout me:  I am 5'11\" and a size 8 (or sometimes a 6), measurements 34B-27-37.  I chose a Medium, and it fits perfectly.  I have a long torso (and so does this top, so it comes all the way down, no belly!) and long arms (I am no stranger to \"full-length\" sleeves stopping somewhere between my elbow and wrist, and these come to my wrist, so that's impressive).  The mesh, criss-cross wrapped material in the body of the shirt is lovely and very flattering, the neckline is perfect for me, low but not too low (though I have a smaller bosom, so it's probably more revealing on someone with more than me) and, of course, the highlight of this top:  the absolutely gorgeous, eye-catching lace burnout sleeves.  Just the right bit of sex appeal.  And on the first wear I got soo many compliments!\n\nThe only caveats:  On me, again, because of my crazy long arms: Though they technically hit my wrist initially, when I bend my arms (which is all the time, being that I use my arms constantly - HA!), the ends ride up to 1-1.5 inches shorter than my wrist, and I find myself tugging them back down several times throughout the day.  Nonetheless, it is gorgeous, and, if you can control the cleavage if you are so-blessed, work appropriate.  :-)  Also, this is one of the more delicate, lacy tops in my collection (though well-made), so you will probably have to be careful about it snagging on rings, fingernails and random things you may encounter like, say, splintered wood on a door frame!\n\nAs I mentioned, the other 3 tops I bought (also in Medium) ALSO fit perfectly.

Oh, sure, I could always wear my Star-Spangled one piece on a date, but why be so obvious? Sometimes, as Diana Prince (or Crystal Starr Light, as I've lately been known), I want something a bit subtle, but also classy. Oh, and something that will last longer than the day (or night).\n\nThis Wonder Woman necklace gets the Wonder Woman Seal of Approval (patent pending). I love it! The pendant has some good weight to it, some great substance, so it won't get destroyed if I happen to need to switch personas on a date to fight crime. I love the crisp lines of my symbol, the shininess of the surface. Gorgeous.\n\nThe chain is a variation of the simple ball necklace chain, but I like it. Simple, effective, long enough so that I'm not looking like I'm wearing a 90's choker. The only \"problem\" is there is no adaptability - the chain is X long, which means should I not be paying attention or wearing the right dress, I may end up Elizabeth Swanning my pendant, if you know what I mean.\n\nOverall, I'm a pleased Superheroine. I wore my pendant last night to the bar for trivia, and while it didn't give me magical powers to answer excruciatingly challenging questions about the Gherkin, I felt it made me stand out in a stylish, classy way. And when I pummeled those thugs afterwards, I didn't lose it in the kerfuffle!\n\nBrought to you by:\n*C. S. Light*", "summary": "Who said I'm not Wonder Woman?", "unixReviewTime": 1402444800}

The back provides full coverage, but the front is quite low (the fabric wraps over itself and can gap open) and requires a cami, a few stitches, or an especially low cut plunge bra. The smocking is flattering, though I do wish it either started just a touch lower or the pattern ended a touch higher. It was an especially good fit for me since I'm reasonable busty and much, MUCH smaller in the waist than the hip. Because of the smocking, I used waist measurements and found there was plenty of extra fabric for my hips. I'm also extremely short waisted (I'm 5'6 and all leg) and it fit surprisingly well, coming to my low ankle. Since I don't wear heels, this was perfect for me. (For the record, I currently have around a 36G bust and 37\" waist. The 2X fits with enough extra room to drape without clinging and has plenty of room for my gigantic hips.)\n\nThe fabric is on the thin side and a touch clingy; I just wore smooth, nude colored panties and bra and it wasn't really a problem. (The texture of lace showed through.) I wore it out one night in Vegas with giant silver hoops and some blingy bracelets and it dressed up as much as you can reasonably expect of a sundress.

I'm 5'9\", 40DD/DDD x 34 x 40.  I have to buy everything based on bust measurement because I'm a bit top-heavy.  So I bought a Large, based on the measurement for chest size on the Size Chart (figuring that the hip measurement doesn't matter as it's not a pencil skirt and the elastic would be forgiving for the waist size).  Fits great.  Dress has full coverage in the sides for larger chests and the side of my bra does not peek out through the armpit which is a common problem I have with this style of dress (YMMV).  Elastic fits snug against ribs just under the boobs - exactly where you want it to be.  Hem hits 4\" above my ankle.  As described and as pictured.  Pay attention to the fabric content: this fabric is almost all polyester and it feels like it.  I don't mean that in a bad way: I love the way the dress drapes and the fabric is a bit textured and is thick enough that nothing shows through.  But if you don't like the feel of polyester then, as beautiful as it is, maybe this dress isn't for you.  I'm going to order more in additional colors/patterns.\n\n**I have to say this because I've seen so many reviews (of this and other dresses) where people complain about the smell of the dress when it arrives from Amazon.  Sometimes the dresses have a funny (not bad, just odd) odor.  I don't know if it's because of the packaging or the warehouse or what.  But who cares?  Don't you wash your clothes?  If you do, that smell goes away with the first wash.  If you don't, you should - because if you're walking around in dirty, sweaty, unwashed clothes then the smell of the new dress is the least of your problems.**", "summary": "I found it fits me just as described by size chart - as described and as pictured.", "unixReviewTime": 1496275200}

Overall, I was pleased with the dresses, with one exception, noted below.  As a note, I was buying this as a nightgown, but I tried to evaluate each also as a dress.\nBlue Paisley- the dress fit as expected (I normally wear a small and the small fit perfectly). The pattern was okay, I found it not as pretty in person as online. The length was perfect for a dress. The material is thin, but not see-through. I did not keep this one because I found the waist shirring to be a tad scratchy and not not as comfortable as the others I tried.  I don't think that would bother me as a dress, but as a nightgown I wanted comfort.\nPink- the style and general fit of this were identical to the blue paisley, except that this dress was cut too short.  This dress hit on my lower calf- not maxi length and it would have looked very odd as a dress.  As a nightgown that wouldn't matter as much, and my husband liked the style and pattern of this dress the best. Unfortunately, it had the same small scratchiness as the blue.  It was returned.\nBlack floral- the style of this is different from the paisley dresses, it does not tie at the shoulders and the waist is different. This is the one I kept and have loved as a nightgown.  It is still thin, yet not at all see-through or revealing.  I found it more comfortable than the other two and I think the pattern looks nicer in person than the picture online.  It fit perfectly.  This dress is a 5 star.\n\nAs a note, I also ordered a Just Love jersey maxi.  It was too thin for me to wear as a nightgown (it would have been immodest without a bra), but it was so cute and incredibly comfortable that I kept one as a dress.", "summary": "Styles vary a lot between colors", "unixReviewTime": 1489363200}

In many cases now, the smallest size offered by these companies is way too baggy on me. I am 5' 3\", 32B bra, 27\" waist, 38.5\" hip. So not tiny.

I bought the exotic print one with the smocked empire waist in teal and fuschia. I first bought the teal in a medium two years ago when I was 5'5\" and 140 lbs. It fit great. I have gained some weight since then (sadly!) but the medium still fits well. The smocking isn't constricting at all, and the empire waist is very flattering-the bottom part of the dress flows over and covers up any muffin top or other issues you may have. The length is also a perfect ankle on me. I will say that I have a long torso/shorter legs,and I am not at all busty. If you have similar measurements but are taller or bustier you might want to go for the large. I currently wear a 6/8 in most dresses. The dress itself is very pretty. The colors and pattern are bold and bright. It's lightweight but not sheer, and you can wear it to a whole variety of events. I've worn it to beach bbqs and also put on a cardigan and worn it to baby showers and church. I wouldn't wear it to a formal event, but you could definitely wear it on a cruise or something of that nature. After about two years of regular wearings and throwing it in the dryer (I got tired of line drying it), the teal one started to get some pilling it and lose thread a bit-kind of the way a swimsuit will after a lot of dips in chlorine, but that was after a lot of wearing and not careful washing, so for the tiny bucks I paid, I definitely got my money's worth! In fact, i came back and ordered the pink! hth someone; clothes are the one thing I get nervous about buying on Amazon because of the sizing.", "summary": "Great Dress For The Price", "unixReviewTime": 1466899200}

Marked off a star for that, as i like buying all different colors of an item if i love the cut/fit but i am hesitant to do this with these due to the variations.

He loves it!!!! I also purchased a second one for my brother who prays the rosary continuously. He was so touched by the gift that he cried when he saw it! He loves his too!! It's a large rosary. I would love to see a women's version of this rosary that would be just a touch smaller!! I would purchase 2 or more for myself and other ladies in my life.

Unfortunately very few commercially made shoes or boots fit me.  If the length is right, the heel is fine but the forefoot is far too narrow.  If a show is wide enough for my forefoot, it's generally much too long.  Wide sizes don't work either, as my heel isn't wide - just my forefoot.  The result of wide sizes is that my heel slides around like an ice skater, not good.  It seems my feet don't match other humans.  So, I have very few shoes.  The few I have are all barefoot/minimal style as that seems to match my feet better.  Most barefoot/minimal shoes are running shoes, great for ummm... running.  What if you want something other than running shoes?  A few options, but not many.\n\nEnter the Belleville Mini Mil series.  I wasn't sure what to expect really, I've read both positive and negative reviews.  There are two boot styles, with differing amounts of toe drop.  These are the transitions, a lower toe drop than most boots, but still more than the other Mini-Mil boots.  They're supposed to be a transition boot to ease you into minimal shoes gradually.  I'm usually either barefoot or have zero drop so to me, these actually feel like a big heel with lots of toe drop.  Still, for people coming from conventional shoes, it'd likely feel flatter.  It's all what you're used to.\n\nI normally wear a 10, but the 10 in these was too large.  I returned them, got a 9.5 and they fit great.  To my surprise, my heel locks right in, the forefoot is plenty wide for even my feet and the length is perfect.  A boot that fits?  Do they feel like an athletic shoe like some reviews have said?  Not to me, but they are light.  They have good traction, decent ground feel - more than most boots but less than most minimal shoes.  They are instantly comfortable, wrapping your foot snugly without crushing it.  The photo looks (to me anyway) like a coyote leather with greenish fabric inside.  The boots that arrived were total coyote colored, I'm fine with that.  I've taken these ona  few hikes with great results.  They aren't waterproof, but that's a good thing.  They drain fast, and dry fast.  I has no sore spots or blisters even after walking through streams, mud, flooded trails, etc.  Wet or dry, didn't phase them.  The uppers wrap around your leg, keeping out scree like grit, pebbles, twigs, ticks... all out of your boot, nice.  My Merrell barefoot shoes always let in stuff like that, so not having it underfoot is a great thing.\n\nOverall, great boot.  I wish they had a little more ground feel, but they're ok as is.  I wish they had a lower heel, but that's my fault - the other model has lower drop than this one.  I went with this one because the price dropped to $57, so I jumped on it to try them out.  Definitely a good move.  The other model with even less toe drop was still around $120, so at half the price I'll deal with the higher heel.  If you want light boots with excellent traction, and that don't feel like a cast on your foot - I think you'll like these.", "summary": "Good boots, light, drain fast, dry fast, comfortable - recommended.", "unixReviewTime": 1501286400}

I wear 10.5R in several styles of older military Belleville boots made in the USA and love them. However, these 115 boots turned out to be made in China (that is on the label inside), not the USA and they are made on a VERY different form (last) than any other Belleville boots I have owned. When they arrived, it was clear the 10.5 size was much smaller than the other Belleville boots plus the front foot pocket is far wider.  I spent the $20 bucks postage to return them and the $16 bucks postage to have them replaced with a size 11, a size larger than I have never worn. The seller was good with that.  However, even the 11s are a bit short at the toe compared to the other 10.5s - toe bang going down hill and they have an even wider in the front pocket. I'm simply going to give the to the local thrift store and stay with the USA made ones. I have posted a picture of my 10.5R USA Belleville boots next to these 11R 115 Belleville boots and you can see the larger front and the fact that the 11s in the Mini-Mil are still a bit shorter. The good news is they are very light and have a good lace system.  However I would not suggest buying these on line and expecting them to fit like other Belleville mil boots.  Also, they do NOT look like the darker brown in the picture. I asked the company about that and the coyote color is tan at best - much lighter than the picture.", "summary": "Beware, these are not like the Belleville Boots made in USA.", "unixReviewTime": 1459728000}

Got almost 20 in.  Just got this boot to go with my OCPs.  Got a Regular, not a Wide.  This is the most comfortable boot I've ever worn, hands down.  I could wear these forever.  I may buy another pair.  This is a warm to moderately cold weather boot.  A few things...\n\nPluses:\n--Paracord laces with plastic shrouded tips (well, it's kinda like paracord...it has a tad bit of elasticity to it).\n--Light!  These boots weigh in ounces, not in pounds.  My buddy at work wanted to see one, I hurled a boot at him.  He caught it with no effort or recoil.  Light as a tennis shoe.  I literally dash up stairs in these things.  Doesn't feel like my feet are wearing weights anymore.\n--Has that nitch at the ankles that allow for easy bending and no special lacing configurations.\n--Fits like a glove.  Feels like a tennis shoe.  This boot contours to your foot.  You can feel what you are walking on.  Feels like those trail shoes that are little more than a sole and covering.\n--Good ankle support.\n--Sole has nice a grip.  It's a Vibram.\n--You can sprint in the boots because they are light and the sole is flexible.\n--No need for an insole (it comes with one), but you can change it out.\n--Breathable.  I wore heavy socks with this boot in July and my feet felt great.\n--Sized right (ie: you normally wear an 8 but for X brand shoe you have to order a 9).\n--AR 670-1 compliant (w/OCPs).  I bought the brown boot, not the coyote brown boot.\n--Break in time is in seconds, not days or weeks.\n\nMinuses:\n--The sole is thin.  You may NOT want to feel what you are walking on like you don't in most thick soled boots.  That being said, if you are fearful of having sharp pointy objects go through your boot, this is not your boot.  You'd want to be careful around nails and pungies with this boot.  I say that to mean that most issued boots have a thick enough, and hard enough, sole to stop most penetrations by nails or similar objects.  This one does not.\n--The sole is thin.  I pronate.  I get that lopsided heel after a while.  With a thick soled boot, with a robust heel, you can get away with uneven wear.  The heel in this boot is not as robust (hard), or high, as the standard issued boot with it's harder Vibram soles.  It's gonna wear out faster.\n--Padding.  There is ample padding for impacts, I don't think it will last for years like a normal issued boot--the sole seems to be of a softer compound than my other issued boots.  And I think the padding will \"scrunch\" like in a sneaker (under the heel), and thus lose some of its impact absorption.  As for ruck marching, this would be a good boot as your feet are not taking a pounding from a hard mostly inflexible sole.  My only concern is the heel.  There's enough padding there, but I feel it's not enough for repeated long marches (early setting in of \"scrunch\").  It just seems awfully thin back there.\n\nIn conclusion, this boot is very comfortable.  Your feet will love them.  However, you're not going to have this boot around for years and get away with only changing the insole.  In garrison, you'll have this boot forever.  In the field, like if you are Infantry, maybe 1-1.5 years.  This boot will likely wear out faster than the normal inflexible, thick soled, boot.  However, the comfort you gain is worth it.  If you get two pair and rotate them, you should be fine.", "summary": "Most comfortable boot I have ever worn.", "unixReviewTime": 1436832000}

I bought them to replace a pair of hiking boots that left my feet and ankles aching at the end of the day because they were unable to flex naturally. I've realized I don't benefit at all from my shoes molding my feet and ankles into a particular position--in fact it's incredibly uncomfortable and fatiguing, especially over uneven ground. These boots are a great relief. The minimal design is protective yet soft, flexible, comfortable, and unobtrusive. I don't need the high tops for ankle support, but they're good for keeping junk and debris from getting down into the foot and protecting the ankles/tendons from knocks and scrapes. I also wear them as work boots around my farm and they hold up well and offer sufficient protection from wear and tear any the occasional stomp from the horses ;-)\n\nI found the sizing to run a bit small, but buying men's shoes is always kind of a gamble for me... I originally ordered an 8.5 but returned them for a 9. I'm 5'10 and normally wear a women's 10-10.5 shoe, have a high arch/instep, average width foot, and my toe just touched the end of the 8.5's, but the 9's are otherwise perfect and will be great even with a heavier sock. Plenty of room in the toebox, lots of adjustment over the instep, ankle, and leg. Very comfortable :-)\n\nThey have a bit too much \"tongue\" (im sure there's a technical name) material which makes them a little bulky and makes tucking in pants awkward. And these come in an 8-eyelet height, but I'd also love a shorter 6-eyelet version. I'd wear those much more often...\n\nOtherwise, no complaints whatsoever!

But for my purposes, they're great.  Best of all, my wife says they don't look like a military boot when I wear them with jeans so I don't mind wearing them in public places.  I plan to coat them with beeswax or some other waterproofing material.  I only wish that they would make them with a waterproofing liner (gor-tex or something like it) to make it waterproof.

I paid no extra for Amazon Prime or any kind of faster delivery.\n\nI read a lot of reviews before ordering this and I'm glad I went with my gut instinct to order two sizes up instead of just one. To help some of you out. I'm  5' 2' around 115lb. I would have normally bought my bra in a 34b American size, but knowing this ran small I decided to go with the 38b and it fits perfectly! There's no tightness under my arms like I've read in some reviews, or wires digging in. I can latch it comfortably using the very first rows of hooks, so in reality I probably could have gone with a 36b, but I'm really glad I went with the 38.\n\nThe bra itself is beautiful. It looks great on and the material it's made of feels great. I love that the elastic in the bra is thick. It has some give, but it feels secure when you're wearing it, and not like it's going to stretch out on you after wearing it a few times so that you have to keep tightening the straps.

There were no lose threads or other imperfections I could find on the bra. The color was great. Exactly as pictured. The inside padding is just the right amount for me and very soft. The little polka-dotted fabric inside the cup is super soft and a cute little touch.

You may read some of these positive and semi-positive reviews, and think you'll go ahead and buy this, but you will definitely regret it.  Best way to describe the costume is it's a backwards Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle costume.  That's exactly what it looks like.  It also looks like a 7 year old child did the graphics and color on it.  There's a lot more white on the mask than what is shown in the item photos (which looks stupid), and the mask is VERY flimsy and doesn't not hold any type of shape that it should.  The eye slit that's on the \"missing eye\" side doesn't really line up with the one on the other side, and the \"missing eye\" side also has a mouth slot, which really shouldn't be there.  In the end, the mask it's up looking more like a melted, dented up Iron Man mask.\n\nThis is quite possibly the worst costume I've ever bought.  It was quickly returned for refund, and we just decided to go a more expensive route and basically make our Death Stroke costume using a much better quality mask and motorcycle protective armor/pads over black pants and a shirt.  You can buy all the components right her on Amazon -- just search for \"Deathstroke Mask\" and then scroll down to the section that says, \"Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought\" and you'll see the pads, utility belt, sword, scabbard, etc.  It looks sooooooo much better than this it's literally comical.", "summary": "Worst costume ever!", "unixReviewTime": 1473552000}

This watch looks beautiful. I meant to buy one with the silver finish, but guess I didn't. I wasn't even disappointing one bit once I put it on. Works very well. Used it until it ran out of fluid and refilled it easier and faster than my more expensive jet lighters. Bought two from different pages to see which would work better, but it turned out to be the same manufacturer under a different title. YES this is CHINESE, but this is more \"quality\" chinese hardware than usual. Does not feel cheap and other than the watch face, does not look cheap. Having paid 11 dollars for this, I can't say anything really bad about it. Exactly what I expected except it did ship much quicker than I thought.\n  The good: -Heavy and feels sturdy. -Fuel lasts a considerable amount of time once filled. -Keeps time well. -Lights every time without fault. -Comfortable even with the weight. -Strong flame that is not put out as easy as a Bic. - Nice shiny finish not easily scratched. -Looks like a normal watch to people who don't know. -\n  The bad: -Uncomfortable straps. -Flimsy straps and buckle. -Hard to read clock hands. -Difficult to light wearing on your left wrist. (I wear all watches on my right). -Did burn my hand once because of the wind. (Nothing bad, just lost a bit of hair.)", "summary": "Read the pros and cons at bottom of review.", "unixReviewTime": 1426377600}

Wore them for servers hours at a Ren Fair and didn't notice I was wearing them half the time.\n\nThe cons to this is I felt like these are priced a bit to high for the quality you receive.

Tad expensive in my opinion.\n\nAlso the horns are threded with a clear plastic adjustable band that kinda take away from the costume. They where very hard to hide and I have thicker hair. I ended up wearing a flowercrown over the band to try and hid them but even in photos I got back back I could still see the band in some angles.\n\nIf you have the time and supplies, which I didn't have at the time, I would highly suggest cutting the cord off and glueing clips to the horns and fastening them in that way.

The dress seems about as long or possibly an inch shorter on my girlfriend than on the woman pictured, and they have identical figures.  If you're ordering this for someone taller who wears a small or has longer legs please consider shorts or leggings may be needed.\n\nQUALITY:\nThe quality of the dress seems good for the price and the stitching is better than what I thought it'd be.  The material feels like normal cotton T-shirt thickness, not the thin soft type.  The dress has two half's, a front and back, with a seam on each side running from top to bottom making the entire back half one piece of blue material.  The red section of the front half is not sown on top of the blue, it's sown onto two blue pieces which are sown onto the back half.  The spider logo and web design seems to be painted on, they're not sown on but I don't think they're not iron on either.  I will double check and update this review.\n\nI purchased this along with the Captain America dress from Rubie's, both are equal quality.\n\nI will upload better quality pictures and if she allows me I will update with a picture of her in the dress for a better idea of how it looks.", "summary": "Good quality for the price", "unixReviewTime": 1428624000}

It may not be water-resistant but it's light and thin (which is a plus for wearing it different weathers and situations), and if 'waterproof' it important to you (it is to me) there are things you can buy (or make) to make it waterproof (without changing the colour). I don't know if it runs small or large because I always get my outerwear in a larger size anyway. This review would have had four stars but it got an extra star for the great customer service.

I ordered a small.\n\nDue to all the complaints about the jacket running small, I very carefully looked at the sizing information listed in the product description. My measurements fell into the small categories, so I ordered a small in the khaki color. It fits just the way it should, perfectly aligned in the shoulders, good arm length, a few inches above my knees, and plenty of room to wear a sweater underneath. In my photos, I am wearing a sweater with a 32 D pushup from VS--I had no issues buttoning around the chest nor did I feel it was too snug. A medium would've been too big.\n\nI have a few other points to make, and an explanation as to why this only got 4 stars instead of 5, but I also have a solution.\n\n1. It is a very nice jacket and is the exact same color as pictured in the description. I am afraid my photos really do not give it justice, but I posted them anyway for you to see for yourselves (and my pup got in on a few of the pics as well)--it really is much more flattering in person!\n\n2. There is no permanently attached label with the care instructions. The only care instructions are on the removable product tag as symbols--translated they mean: do not tumble dry, iron medium heat, do not dry clean,  machine wash cold, do not bleach.\n\n3. It has big pockets!\n\n4. It has a little bit of a funny chemical/packaging smell and is wrinkled from being folded for delivery, but I am sure both will go away when I wash it, and let it hang to dry.\n\n5. It is definitely not at all water proof, and not even water resistant, which is why it only has 4 stars. I took pictures to show that if you spatter it with water, the fabric instantly absorbs the droplets--no beading at all. I thought maybe it still kept the water away from the wearer, but I have another picture showing how it will saturate through. Now, I live in Florida, so water proofing is a necessity. Therefore, I will be treating the coat with a product I've found to work great, doesn't change the color of fabrics, doesn't leave any weird residues, doesn't have a scent, and doesn't cost much (you can get it at Walmart and perhaps for cheaper than here on Amazon). It is called Atsko Silicone Water-guard&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Atsko-Silicone-Water-Guard-10-5-oz/dp/B0001FYL2M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Atsko Silicone Water-Guard 10.5 oz</a>&nbsp;and will make fabrics and surfaces water resistant (if you put enough on, it will make it practically waterproof--I've seen a youtube video where a paper-towel was treated, then completely submerged in water and remained dry).\n\nOtherwise, a great jacket for the price!", "summary": "Very cute jacket :) Just go by the sizings listed!", "unixReviewTime": 1439251200}

Usually, I buy Bailey hats, but, I saw this hat in tan and bought it. I was extremely disappointed  the shipper didn't pack the hat in it's own box. My hat arrived rather misshaped and didn't look like the pictures. I know, the listing says these hats are crushable; however, once they are crushed it is difficult to get them back into their designed shape. The hat is described as a diamond top, but, after it was shipped, the best I can do is get it into a somewhat round shape. I feel absolutely certain, if the hat was in the shape as shown in the pictures and properly packed in it's own separate box, then these would be extremely cool hats. My hat fits a tad loose; however, I love the fit, because my head can breathe. I haven't worn the tan hat for more than 15 minutes as I may return it to get a hat in proper shape. The gray and black hat hasn't arrived, yet. I'll write the rest of my review after it arrives.\nAgain, I believe, these hats are definitely worth buying, the price is appropriate, but this particular style of hat needs to be properly packed in a box taller than three inches.

The material is thin, and somewhat see-thru, but it's pretty standard for packaged costumes.  The dress is pretty plain, it's just a straight tubular shape.  If you're curvy like me, it will hug your curves. However the material is not super stretchy... it has a little bit of stretch, so if you normally wear clothing larger than 15/16... this may not work for you.", "summary": "LOVE IT!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1471219200}

The frames do have a gold/champagne like color to them, but in certain light, they also almost have a rose like tint to them. The lenses are dark brown, and only look like the pictures when direct light is passing through. In other words, they will look dark brown on your face.\n\n2) These are small frames made for someone with a slender face or a child. You get no sense of that in the picture.\n\n3) The item description says these are \"unisex\", but I disagree. These sunglasses are definitely more suitable for a woman's face. They just have a feminine look to them that is not conveyed in the pictures.\n\n4) For $25, these are terribly overpriced. I've bought sunglasses like these at half the price, and twice the quality. The frame is a rather ordinary plastic. Not cheap, but certainly not high-end. There are no flexible hinges on the stems, and you don't even receive a nice gift box or bag, or cloth for wiping the lenses.

The chain, which has a lobster-claw clasp, has filigree links. The pendant and chain are made of a lightweight metal alloy. The pendant also has filigree details and open work. The top section of the pendant is where the bail is located and is the smallest section. It measures 15 x 15 mm. It is topped with a very small cross, a small lilac rhinestone and a small green resin stone. The middle section measures 22 x 28 mm, has wings, and two small green resin stones. The last section is the crescent moon, measuring 52 x 46 mm.  The moon has three large resin stones as well as rhinestones\n\nThen we get to the \"stones.\" The large resin stones on mine are green rather than blue. They are faceted but also have a sheen, chatoyancy to them, almost like a tiger eye or star gems.  There are also numerous crystals/rhinestones in different sizes and colors.

When I received the swimsuit it was too big! The stomach area was too large, the bust area was too large, it was simply not a comfortable fit. Thankfully, FREE returns! So I returned it right away, and took a leap and purchased a Medium. When it arrived it fit perfectly! The falsies did nothing for my already small chest, but the swimsuit itself fit nicely. I have worn in various times now, I believe the fabric to be of nice quality no complains there. It fits comfortably, and hugs my body well.

I am seeing improvement in my foot problem but I am also doing foot exercises & stretching more.  The shoe fits just right & is supportive.  The strings are a little short but I am happy with that.  I have other shoes that the strings are so long I have had to figure out ways to multiply tying so I don't trip over them.

The stretchy string used is very thick so the bracelet not only looks expensive, but doesn't feel flimsy.\nIt's high quality.  One thing to mention is that the bracelet I have on has the three jade beads faceted (instead of polished and round like the others).\n\nI have a 5 5/8th inch wrist so it is a little big on me.  However, I don't want to restring the bracelet as it's significant for me to keep the 3 sets of 7 beads intact.  I do meditate with this bracelet.  What I do is wear this bracelet with another healing bracelet that is also too large and twist them together.  Or just let it dangle...it won't come off.\n\nI don't spend a lot on jewelry and do not regret spending over $50 for two bracelets. Very pretty and of high quality.

I still wear it out though and get compliments a lot. :)\n\nUPDATE: I ended up buying a new belt and it has not had the same problem and I've had it for longer. My advice is just to not touch the bow and maybe the netting won't poke through like my first one did. Since it is such a low price, the fabric around the netting isn't especially strong, so just be aware of that. Now one of my favorite things about this belt is that  this belt is thick, so sometimes I can tuck my shirt into the belt. It is a great purchase for the price!\n\nHope this was helpful!", "summary": "Happy with Purchase!", "unixReviewTime": 1437609600}

Sooooo glad I did. This suit is GoRGeOUS and looks designer and does not look cheap and now I am even more motivated to keep working out.

Loose it would lay about 1- 1 1/2 inches above the knee. I don't know why but the dress would gather, like static, with my underwear and everytime I walked I had to keep pulling it down, then it was a windy day and it kept wanting to go up seeing as the fabric is so light. It is pleated all the way around and it gathered a little too much in some spots (the front) more than the others, so when I gathered it with the belt I had to adjust the dress so that it looked evenly pleated otherwise it would bulge out right under the bust (I don't know if that makes sense).\nBut the day I wore it everyone complimented this $15 dress, \"that dress is so pretty\", \"I love your dress\", etc, even though I had a hard time wearing it. :)\nBTW my 12 year old tried it on too and it fit her although she said she felt the top of the dress exposed her shoulders/back too much.

The colors are true, the skirt is about a half-skirt which, on me, is very full.  They seem well made for the price.  The model in the pictures must be below 5 ft so be aware that if you're of average height (5'2 to 5'6) this skirt will be much shorter than in the picture.  I'm 4'11 and when I'm barefoot then the skirts just touch the ground.  In my 5 1/2\" heels, the skirts are around my ankles.  It's the perfect length for me.  I'm 33-26-33 and, like I said, the skirt is plenty full enough to look flattering and blow about in the breeze.  The waist is snug but not tight and has still a lot of stretch in it.\n\nHere's the reason for the two star reveiew though.  The green, red and purple skirts are no where near those colors!  What is described as 'red' is actually a very bright, blinding pink!  The green isn't the pretty emerald green I was expecting but is a very drab teal color.  The purple isn't the deep rich purple I wanted but instead more of a raspberry color.

So, when I saw that this one came in a DDD size, I expected it to run small like others and ordered a size up (the DDD).\n\nNote to everyone out there... this thing does not run small.  The DDD covered my entire breast and then some... to the point that it was actually a little large and showing in the armpit area and at the top of my shirt like a full coverage bra ... Which isn't what you're going for when you are wearing a shirt that is in need of an invisible bra.\n\nI don't count this as a negative, that the product is actually made to fit a large chest.  I will be ordering again in a D and DD cup to try them out.\n\nBut, I will say that the DDD cup was a little conical in shape and not the same shape as is pictured on the model in the photo, and that is a little bit of a minus because I felt the coverage and shape were not going to allow any support or lift or hide under your clothing.  You should be able to apply a cup like this to the outermost area of your breasts and pull them in to snap them together for support and cleavage, but this one covered so much that I could have pulled them apart to snap them rather than pulling them together.\n\nThe bra adhesive worked well and I'm hoping the D or DD works.  I'm actually thinking that I may try the D (even though I am a DD) because the DDD was so large!  But that's a good thing, in the grand scheme of things, because these may fit a wider range of women... though you may have to try them a few times to get your proper size.\n\nwill review again once I have a proper fit!", "summary": "I expected it to run small like others and ordered a size up (the DDD)", "unixReviewTime": 1407888000}

Stiviano in the whole Clippers debacle. I was amused by the Daft Punk styled anonymity it provided, while also providing shade and UV protection. So I decided to get one, originally more as a joke.\nAs it turned out, it really is a great product. I myself am a big guy, and the headband fit very nicely - not too snug, and not loose - while the visor itself was not too big, but large enough to cover my entire face. It also is adjustable, up and down, to wear it more as a regular hat-styled visor, or pulled downward like a welder's mask.\n\nEither way, it provides very adequate sun protection, claims to offer good UV protection, and you can see easily enough through it. For anyone who spends a lot of time in the sun, especially gardening or whatnot, I highly recommend this visor. Also, at the beach, when reading or whatever activities you may be doing, this covers the entire face, so you are not having to squint, and it provides better protection against sand blowing in your face.\n\nAnd I will add that the price was right for what it is. A definite must have for those who want sun protection... or anonymity.  :)", "summary": "Great visor, does the job", "unixReviewTime": 1399680000}

Shipping was very fast, three days.  The visibility is the same as the first one. The headband feels tighter although it is the same size.  Unlike the black one, the protective film on the purple rainbow model was extremely hard to remove.  There were no English instructions and it took me a while to figure out that the dullness on the underside was caused by a second film. The film and the label were actually sewn into the trim, and it took me half an hour with tweezers to get it all out, leaving permanent marks despite trying to be careful.  I took off one star because of having to struggle with the film.  The rainbow effect is easily marred by contacting other surfaces.  Otherwise the visor seems sturdy, but based on reviews I won't leave it in the hot sun.\nFIRST PURCHASE:  The basic black full-face visor is just what I need in the Arizona sun. The protective film on both sides of the plastic comes off easily along with the labels. The glare reduction is similar to regular sunglasses, not too light or dark. The headband adjusts down to a small head size, and the tilt is also adjustable.  It's efficient because it saves putting on both a hat and sunglasses, and you can wear it with prescription glasses.  Its ability to shade the whole face and neck is a plus in Arizona, and you won't get raccoon eyes like with sunglasses.  If you're multi-tasking between outdoors and indoors, you can leave it on and still see in both locations.  The price was right, $11.50 with free shipping, and it arrived in a fast four days (Monday to Friday).  The visor is bound to last longer than sunglasses which often get lost or broken.  I will probably succumb to a rainbow one when the price is right, but meanwhile the Darth Vader effect is perfectly practical.

Okay, let's start with the good. I like the fabric. Its cool to the touch, drapes beautifully, a thin/light knit, but not scandalously transparent for our times. It'd be a great warm weather dress. The construction of the garment is pretty great considering how inexpensive it is. The elastic doesn't seem to be tacked down in the elastic casing, so the elastic kinda twists inside of it when its put on/taken off. No worries, since I can secure it quickly with a few stitches. Now, the bad. The size is a bit crazy. If it wasn't for the other reviews I would have been shocked. Yes, its Asian sizing. Yes, they do run smaller scales than American/Western size charts. But really, then the size chart needs to be adjusted to reflect your market and buyers. I wear size 0 to 2, 5' 4\" and so, this \"Large\" dress fits me no probs. THEN the other thing is, the color is not grey. Its a taupe-ish color. Not quite brown or mocha, but lighter than that...ummm...I believe it can be called greige. Its a great item and the price is awesome, and had I known the color was not grey, I would have gotten the black.

She is a tiny baby so 0-3 don't exactly fit well and there was no \"newborn\" size so we just left it be and dealt with it being big. I LOVE this fabric its nice and gentle feeling so its not scratchy on the baby and i ADORE the tutu. We put leggings with it just so that it was warmer for her but other then that the outfit all kind of just \"flows\" together. You could also get a bigger size and this would be a GREAT first birthday outfit, or for just family pictures. I mean you can use cloths for just anything but there are tons of cloths that are meant for just one thing. I don't like that they don't have \"newborn\" size (if you are a parent you will understand) because \"0-3\" is usually big on a newborn and then you go up to a 0-3. But if you have a big baby I could understand ;) but I personally think that over all this is a beautiful outfit and i love it :)", "summary": "supper cute :)", "unixReviewTime": 1455235200}

The brim naturally droops in a wavy fashion as seen in the photo.  I bought two of them, one to make a tricorn hat or admiral hat, and the other one for diva days.  If you want to look like a mysterious sexy diva, this is the hat for you.  We were at the zoo and saw numerous ladies wearing wide brim hats of straw. cloth, and felt.  What is nice about felt hats is you can stream them to re-shape them.  You get a good quality unlined hat for a very cheap price.  The hat does not look cheap.  You can get the look without spending all your money.  Also don't let the estimated lengthy shipping time bother you.

Also, the fabric is very thin - but I didn't expect anything too fantastic given the price.\n\nThe PROS:  It's a very cute, pinup  look.  The seller is very responsive and friendly.  I requested a return and they responded quickly, warning me that the shipping cost is $12.75, (I mean, the product itself was $12.88 + shipping), so they offered options.

I have a pear shape.  I purchased an XL after reading the reviews. My main concern was that the top would be too large, and alas, it was.  When I originally ordered the suit, I weighed 165lbs, thus the XL.  The suite was originally a little tight around the legs, but now it fits me really well, borderline too big.  The top originally was a touch too large, but it could pass as okay if I tied the straps extra tight.  However, since I've lost some weight, I can't wear the top anymore. Unfortunately, the way the top is constructed, I really can't alter it to fit, either.  I have one complaint about the top: even though there are underwires, when on it feels as though your breasts may slip out underneath at any moment.  Perhaps it is just how it was constructed, but I think I'd be overly concerned about having an 'accident' than having any fun at the beach.\nThe other reason I had to give this suite a 4 instead of a 5, is because the feel of the fabric leaves much to be desired.  It feels very thin, like there is only one, worn out layer hastily sewn together.  The first time...(and the second time) I put it on, I heard all the seams rip and tear. I'm not exactly sure what that means, but it can't be a good sound.\nThe High Waist Retro Vintage Bikini Swimsuit is very cute and flattering to those who want to hide their problem tummy areas.  The 50's vintage look is very popular now and the red/blue combo works well. For $10.00, it's hard to find a better deal, too. I recommend this suite for someone who has more of an hourglass or apple shape, where they won't be concerned about the top or bottoms not fitting well. This suite is meant for tanning in the sun and occasional *dips* in the pool.  I would NOT recommend this suite for any kind of swimming or any lengthy wearing.  If possible, use this as your \"cute & trendy suite to show off on the beach with,\" but not intended for getting wet. *Only my opinion, not fact. It's very possible that this suite will hold up find under lots of swimming. I just don't want to be caught on the beach with a suite malfunction.  :)", "summary": "In this Retro Vintage Bikini, you'll find your inner Fashionista & Save lots of $$$", "unixReviewTime": 1442102400}

I spent a few hours reading reviews to try and figure out if it would fit or not. After a long consideration I went ahead and bought it. I mean for the price I guess it really didn't matter but it looked so cute and I wanted it. I got it today and it took about 20 days to get here which isn't a problem cause my expected delivery date was 2 weeks from now. When I tried on the bottoms I did hear some of the seams give but I figured that's expected. The bottoms fit great though and covered my belly and stretch marks from pregnancy and covered all my scars but one from my gallbladder surgery, so I was very happy about that. The top though did not fit as I would have liked, it was a little small but I can still wear it and not pop out. I knew from reading reviews that the top is wireless.

These Sun Shield glasses fit over my glasses very nicely of which some people complained that theirs didn't. My glasses are about 5 3/4\" across & 1 3/8\" from top to bottom which is larger than the \"normal\" designer glasses that most people wear. The cost is a little high as these are not very strong & won't take too much punishment, but, they are light-weight & are very comfortable. It looks as though the lens can fall out without too much pressure, so I suggest that you should be gentle when you clean them.  I am not active & so far I only wear them when I am sitting down so I don't need a strap to keep them on my face. I wish that we had more choices on the lens color, as I prefer blue for daytime & yellow at night, not these brown ones as I am not getting a true color of the world.  I love the sides being wide with the little window as it does a great job of keeping the sun from hitting my eyes on the side which was a problem if the sun is low in the sky.

I live in Florida, wear trifocals so I didn't want to spend on expensive prescription sunglasses that really do not fully shield the rays.\n\nThese seemed a reasonable solution. These kind of wrap around your prescription glasses like a visor to keep rays from coming around them into your eyes.\n\nThey shield well, have decent peripheral vision. The top part hits my eyebrow - I get why it has to be like a visor but that eyebrow thing bugs me. I found a smaller pair at Walgreen,\\'s but they do not have the good peripheral vision of these.

The side lenses particularly. I used my Bondic repair kit I bought on Amazon to run a bead line of this plastic welding material around the edge of each lens to keep it from popping out. The side lenses fall out by them selves, so I use the Bondic to keep them in. I think the quality of these sunglasses is dropping with respect to the lenses fitting in the frames. If you are not handy with things like securing the lenses in the frames, you may want to pass on these. Or be very careful on how you handle them and keep them in a case at all times they are not being worn.\nMy wife has been using these sun shields over her prescription glasses for years. She broke her last pair (they are not as durable as more expensive glasses, but will last several years if you are careful) and could not find a replacement locally. I searched Amazon and found these. There are a lot of these brand glasses on Amazon, the trick is finding the right size, many do not give these size in the product description. They come in 3 or 4 sizes. These were identified as S/M and said to fit over most women's glasses and men's small glasses. These were perfect for her. They are also Polarized which helps with glare. Since they ship under Amazon Prime, we got them in less than two days. If they lasted for 6 or 8 years I would give them a 5-star.

There is no room to whine about \"pashmina\" when the list price is only $15.99 and you're only paying $4.99. 'Cause honey, that ain't real pashmina to start with at that list price! ;)\nThe reason I rate this three stars is because although the quality is about what I expected there is a distortion in representation in the photo. The shawl pictured looks at least twice as thick as what it really is, even when the actual product is doubled over on itself. Also, while the pattern is lovely the colors aren't as vibrant as pictured.\nAll that said, this was a Christmas gift for my cousin and she loved it so that's all that really matters to me in the end. :)", "summary": "It's okay, not exceptional in anyway, obviously not pashmina, but a good look for a cheap price", "unixReviewTime": 1420502400}
