I have a skin condition and am having trouble finding all cotton bras that have any shape.  I am small framed and thought I would take a chance on this.  It did not work out for me.  The size I ordered was too small and the bra was not as comfortable as I would like so I probably will not order up.  I also am not certain even a larger size would give me enough cup coverage, plus I really wanted white (I react to clothing dyes) - so not the bra for me.  But I do have to say that this bra runs somewhat larger than the Hanes and Maidenform teen bras of the same size - and the cotton sure feels a lot nicer than those plastic-like fabrics most teen bras are made of.  I wish I could have found these bras when my teen daughter was younger. It is cute and offers good support for the size.  It also has a good amount of padding so it is modest and fills the cups a bit but isn't overly padded like the push-up bras. (About 1/4 to 1/2 inch padding,  so if your daughter is a young preteen you might find it adds too much shape.)  Some comments:  A previous poster suggested that size 36 = adult 36 B but I would suggest it is more like an adult  34 B.  The bra is almost exactly the same size as the old 34 B's I still have in my drawer from my skinnier days.  The cotton is fairly soft but the lace is scratchy.  I don't think it sits against the skin,but I wish they had used cotton lace.  The bra straps are bit sharp - kind of \"knife-edge.\"  Again, I wish they had used better quality straps; personally I would be willing to pay up for better quality all around.  But for many teens this might not be an issue,  Finally, the bra I got had a slight discoloration on the strap like maybe the bra had been sitting around in a warehouse for a while.", "summary": "Good bra for young teen - more generous fit than most teen bras", "unixReviewTime": 1461888000}

Obviously it depends on the look and the style, because they are marketed as a young, sporty, comfortable and teeny look. Not the lingerie and over-sexualized loo you often get in young girls underwear, especially in the UK.\nIn the UK it is often quite a task to find decent training bras, teen bras and in general a more conservative look. As the mother of 3 girls I have had plenty of experience with this kind of dilemma.\nThis bra (I had two of mine test drive it) is very comfortable, looks great on and fits well. As you can in the pics it is a combo of slight lingerie look, sporty and comfortable every day bra.

However, when I received YogaRat Men's XrossFlex Land& Sea T-shirt I was greatly pleased with the shirt.  First off, I am right between a medium and a large, so I decided to play it safe ordered large and hope for the best. I am 5'10 and the shirt fits well.  Now I would not call this a compression shirt, but because I have fairly large arms, it was fairly tight like a compression shirt through the arms, which is what I was hoping for.  But the rest of the shirt is not compression at all, as it fits fairly loose.  The material, however, feels like the material of a compression shirt.  With my fairly broad shoulders, this shirt still fit pretty spot on for me.  The material isn't a think material, but medium weight and stretchy.  What I love is that this shirt is made for both use on land and in sea.  I sometimes wear swim shirts, as I don't like to burn at the beach.  This would definitely be a shirt I could wear that provides me with the protection I need, with a UPF of 50+.  The drawback would be wearing something long sleeve in the sun, but if I was going to be in the water most of the time, this shirt would be ideal, as it allows for all activities.  I think it is even more ideal as a base layer during the winter, or playing sports in the winter.  As it is summer right now, time will tell.  But I look forward to using it for running, during the colder months.\n\nPros:\n-Good for use in water or on land\n-Great sun protection\n-Has the warmth of a compression shirt, without the tightness\n-Fits well through chest, arms, and waist\n-Neutral color choices available\n\nCons:\n-The only thing I would have liked to have seen was slightly shorter arm lengths.  Because it is tight through the arms it is not bad, but about one inch less would have been ideal (again I am 5'10, so probably a better fit for most.)\n\nI received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review!", "summary": "Great Active Shirt for Water and Land", "unixReviewTime": 1436140800}

Feels silk smooth in hand and when worn it's like it's not even there.\n\n// FIT\nWhen I put this shirt on the sleeves always become twisted around my arm and I have to spend a minute getting them straight. This is because the arms are a little bit snug in the forearms, more so than the rest of the shirt. I don't have Popeye forearms, actually they are quite slender. If you have large arms, especially forearms, this shirt might bug you (unless you enjoy really tight sleeves.)\n\nThe length of the sleeves are great for me. Again, 6' 5\" wearing an XL, and the sleeves got an inch or so beyond my wrist. Really great coverage.\n\n// MATERIAL\nI first thought 'I'm going to be hot' when I saw it is 84% polyester, 16% spandex. But it's not! It's actually cooler than cotton. Really surprised by that. A nice breeze going by makes the fabric really cool as it wicks the moisture away and cools the fabric.\n\n// GREAT FOR\nThis shirt would be great for people with full arm sleeve tattoos as the sleeve goes down to your hand and blocks the sun with UPF 50+ sunblock level. Great way to protect your work from getting wrecked by the sun.\n\nAlso great for activities where you need your shirt to stay close to your body. While I am wearing the shirt, it hangs very much in the same way ti does in the pictures of the model. A little bit of slack in the torso, but not much.\n\nI received a free sample of this product to evaluate and provide an unbiased review.", "summary": "This review is for a 6' 5\" 200lbs male wearing an XL - sleeves are long!", "unixReviewTime": 1436140800}

There was a great deal of anticipation for this costume and when my daughter attempted to put it on........the garment is 8 inches smaller than the stated size around the bust, the waist, and the hips.  From the reviews published, this is an issue the company is well aware of.  Regardless of the difference in size range, an inch is still an inch, and this garment is not as advertised.  Now, Nuoqi wants us to pay for the return postage to Texas for their mistake.  After five years, the company should have their QC under control.

It easily fits a wallet, cell phone, snacks and makeup bag. It is really nicely made with strong stitching and more room than I expected. The back of it has a small zipper pocket. There is a thick handle at the top for carrying or hanging it up. The straps can almost double in length. On the front is a zippered pocket that protrudes out and a small zippered pocket on the front of that. The flap covering the top has a flap on it that covers a tiny zippered pocket. To open up the back pack you have to unclip the large flap from from a ring by squeezing the clip together. The bag closes with a drawstring type of process using a PU Leather rope. The interior has a small zippered pocket and a large open pocket that is split into two sections. One is flat and the other slightly puffs out to hold larger items.\nAgain I love this bag and will definitely recommend it.\nI receieved this bag at discount prices in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "I love my new bag", "unixReviewTime": 1455235200}

Coincidentally, she had been looking for a little backpack to use when we go hiking or on long walks. She had been looking for an alternative to her purse, which she carries everywhere, and which was something I had been giving her a hard time about. Why? Because she's always telling me to watch it while she goes to the bathroom, or \"Don't forget to lock the doors of the truck, because her purse is in there.\" And I'm like: \"Why did you bring your purse? We're eighty miles from the nearest store.\" Or she'll ask me to keep an eye on her purse when it's sitting on our restaurant table six inches away from my right hand. How can I not keep an eye on the purse when it's right in front of my face? But I digress...\n\nShe likes this backpack. The pack is light, but made from quality materials, and it has padded straps. There is plenty of room for books, papers, a laptop, and it has a nice zippered pouch on the inside and two side pockets for water bottles. It's perfect for my wife because she can dump the essential contents of her purse into the zippered pouch and carry a sweater and/or windbreaker and water. I wouldn't put keys or anything metallic and sharp into the zippered pouch area. Phone, wallet, money, makeup, divorce lawyers contact information, stuff like that.\n\nBecause the backpack doesn't have a belt attached to it, I would not recommend it for someone who is doing serious mountain climbing. For the same reason, if you work as a bicycle or motorcycle delivery person on busy metropolitan streets, you'll probably want a pack you can secure to your torso at multiple points. All of its cuteness won't do you much good if the pack slides sideways while you're trying to avoid a bus or a rock slide.\n\nAnyway, my wife likes it, and that's all that matters.", "summary": "Cute and Functional", "unixReviewTime": 1437350400}

There is lots of room inside the main compartment and on one side is a padded pouch (11\" x 11\") with an elastic Velcro closure that could hold a laptop.

I have a few backpacks and this is the only one that will fit my water bottle in the side pocket. I usually have to put my water bottle inside the pack so I really like that feature.  It also has a large 7 1/2\" deep and 11\" wide front pocket and even though it shows a buckle it actually closes with a magnetic snap.\n\nThe pack has a loop in the back to hang it up. The shoulder straps are slightly padded and adjustable. There are two zippers that close the main compartment. The stitching is well done and I don't find any rips or tears.\n\nThis is a smaller pack than some I have, but it can hold a lot. Right now it's holding my current crochet project and all my accessories.

Like buying jeans and jean leggings that look exactly the same, this one is the winner of the two packs.\n\nThe pockets are great. I can fit everything from a camera to a sports bottle in them. The inside will hold books or clothes. Take it to the beach, use it as a trendy carry on bag. Front pocket holds an iPad mini in an otterbox case for size of the pocket idea.

It's not a cheap plastic overlay that will peel off.\nThe stitching is high quality as well; I don't suspect this will fall apart even with heavy use. The tote has a gusseted bottom, making it easy to stuff full with out it bulging uncomfortably.\n\nWith no size specifications in the description, I suspected the tote might be quite small. Unfortunately, I was right. Laying flat, the tote measures 14\" x 9\". Being that size, it's definitely not a tote I'd take grocery shopping.\n\nThe main reason for my 3 star rating is that the bag has \"NOT FOR SALE\" written on it in big, bold, white letters. (see photo) What upsets me more, is that the seller went out of their way to carefully mark that out on their photo of the tote. I didn't notice it when I first purchased it, but it became quite apparent once I was looking for it. Seems quite deceptive.\n\nOverall, I like the bag. It's high quality and inexpensive.

I was wearing an almost floor length dark blue dress with a slit up the side, I LOVED how it looked with the lace pattern peeking out. My husband loved it too ;)\n\npros:\n\n1) The material these pantyhose are knit out of is very soft, not scratchy at all.\n2) The fact that they fit me!  I was a little uncertain if they would work because I'm a US size 12-14 and these are a \"one size\", but they were great! Plenty of stretch.\n3) material seemed to hold up well, nothing snagged or ripped.  Granted I wasn't doing anything crazy, but still.  As you read above I have a history of ripping my pantyhose!!\n\ncons:\n\n1) Not control top.  This wasn't a problem for me because I had a slimming garment I wore on top of the nylons but if I hadn't been wearing that, you probably could have seen a faint outline of the waistband because my dress was tight fitting.\n2) seemed to be a little more \"toe room\" than I needed, didn't really matter because of my shoes though.\n\nOverall I really liked these tights, especially the flirty print.

I weigh around 150, I'm 5'4ish and my weight distribution is average for my size. I wear a 34-36c bra and ~ size 6-8 pants. I got this in a XL (US 8-10).\n\nThe top is WAAAAAY to big. Like, I thought I was relatively large in the chest area, but this is insane. I'd classify this as something like a 38DD. It makes me feel like a 12 year old boy. I can't imagine anyone of average size who wears a US 8-10 fitting into this. There is no way I could wear this in public. Even tied as tight as it goes, it hangs somewhere in my mid-region and rests about 3 inches away from my skin.\n\nThe worst part is, the bottom is a bit too small. You'd expect it to be as large as the top, right? Nope. It's made for someone who's disadvantaged in the behind, I suppose. The leg holes are uncomfortably tight around my thighs and my waist is bordering on a muffin top when I put this on. The polka dots on my butt become little pink ovals and the blue becomes slightly see-through.\n\nMaybe I'd have better things to say if the top and bottom were actually a coordinating size - I'd just decide that I bought too large, or too small. But this swimsuit is definitely designed for Barbie or someone similarly top-heavy. I'm very confused and somewhat afraid.

The medium was still way too big for my lower half; I think a small might have sufficed and fit nicely.\n The top, however, was unrealistic, but maybe that's just because I have no boobeez. The circumference of the top sucked the life out of the width of my top half, but then there was the vacant empty cups where I think boobs are supposed to go.\n I don't think ordering a size down would have solved the problem, because the band fit too tightly around me as a medium. A size down would suffocate me, and then I'd still have the issue where the bust is too empty and easily reveal my dad nips. (Auto correct changed \"sad\" to \"dad\" but it was too funny to fix.)\nI'm really sad about this purchase, but I returned it and got my money back... minus a dollar I had to pay for at UPS for the return print out sticker.

I did like the halter around neck because straps were thicker and placed nicely to cover the little fat armpit bulge. The band is thick around the waist and nicely hides a small fat roll. So none of that back bra fat bulge. The drawback to the top was that you have to pull it over your head and slide it down, like a sports bra sorta, and that was NOT fun trying to take off while wet and needed a little assistance taking it off. My teen daughter got a good laugh from it. The bottoms were slightly too large and didn't have snug support. I have what I like to call a kangaroo pouch fupa flap (aka slightly droopy belly above csection scar) so bottoms didn't give the supported fit Id hoped for. Once out of the water, the material didn't rouge at sides anymore it draped so loosely and seriously accentuated the flappy pooch. Id agree that it would be nice to pick separate sizes for tops and bottoms. However, for the price of this suit the material was better than I expected. I was corncerned it would be thin and easily see through, bleed colors everywhere and disintegrate once exposed to water. It didnt. I am short and so the bottoms were higher than probably most but it didn't bother me bc it showed the only sliver of tummy that doesnt have stretch marks or cellulite. Just was not a good fit for me since bottoms became so loose after being in water. Im 50, 170 lbs and wear a 38-40 D depending on brand and 12-14 bottoms. Not the worst bathing suit but I did purchase two other sets from Amazon and those gave a much more flattering look.", "summary": "Not terrible but don't love", "unixReviewTime": 1532044800}

I don't spill out of it like most tops and it provides just the right amount of support without making you look like you're trying too hard.

Their kind offer does not affect my personal opinion about the item.\n\nWhen travel, I always find it a bit of a pain to manage my underwear.  If I put my bras and the panties in the same bag (drawstring/carry bags), then they will mix up or some bras would hook onto the others.  If I put them in separate bags, there will be too many bags to unpack/pack.  Now this simple, yet brilliant idea  an underwear travel case, does help me solve the problem.\n\nThe case has one main compartment for your bras, I say it can fit about 3- 5 bras(depends on your bras are heavily padded or not , and also your size of the bras).  There are also 3 mesh pockets for panties or socks.  Yes only 3 mesh pockets, but again panties are easy, you can always put more in the case sit them next to the bras.  I don't think they will get messy when everything is snuggly fitted in.\n\nSizing is as described, the case looks as good as it shows online, except for the colour.  I got the pink one, but in reality it is closer to red.  It is hard to photograph the real colour as my photos here make the case looks like purple.  Therefore, I tinted one of my photos here (pic A) to show the real colour better. (I didn't tint all the photos as it is too much work).\n\nThe case is of great quality in my opinion.(enclosed couple closer shots for quality referene)  The zips are sturdy, no trouble in turning the corners.  The stitches are good.  Inside is fully lined with the same material used on the outside.  The top and the bottom of the case is hard-ish, could be cardboard inside to keep the shape.  Inside there is the manufacturers /suppliers label, which is always a good sign of a good quality item.  I am also liking the handle on the top which comes in handy when taking to the bathroom.\n\nI am very happy with this little bag, I would recommend for others, just have to take a notion of the colour.  Hope this helps.", "summary": "Great thinking", "unixReviewTime": 1464480000}

They grey one is softer and slightly more comfortable, but still tight (especially one leg is tighter than the other one - and I swaer it's not my legs!! LOL). while the black one is a bit rougher and much tighter.\nOverall satisfied but only because I didn't pay too much for them. AND they are see through enough... so you can't work out in them but definitely use under a dress or long shirts. Also they are a bit shorter than shown in picture.", "summary": "Satisfied and disappointed at the same time. Nice but only when on discount.", "unixReviewTime": 1445385600}

They are made of very spandex like material but are still really soft and comfortable. Something I really liked about these that I am not really sure is even suppose to be a feature, is that you can wear them with the band folded over or you can wear them where the band is not folded over and go higher up your waist. I like this option when I am working out cause in my mind it helps holding in my tummy area. If you are in between sizes I would recommend going smaller only because they are really good at stretching so if you think you can go smaller, do it. You will not have problem with these being see through, which was a plus for me. I only gave it four stars because I was expected it to have a little more of a cotton material.

It can be worn anytime, anywhere!  I received many compliments on this dress and loved that it gave me a lot of length.  The stitching is well done and secure.  The hems are all straight and clean!

NinaQueen to the rescue! This purple leather wrapped style bracelet is exactly what I was looking for. The leather feels of good quality and the bracelet overall feels very sturdy and well made. The purple is a little darker than actually pictured, but for me that wasn't a problem. The magnetic clasp can be a little tricky to work on your own, but once you get the hang of it, it's easy to take on and off. I love the silver and purple clasp; it just adds a nice touch to the bracelet itself. My only wish is that it was a little thicker. I was kind of hoping that the leather bracelet would prevent my beads from sliding around so I wouldn't have to use spacer beads, but it's just as thin as the metal bracelets, so the beads do tend to slide around. Again, this still doesn't detract from the overall quality of the bracelet itself, and I would definitely buy it again!

I had a hard time reconciling a 6-8 being an XL but, tape measure in hand, I did my measurement checks and hit 'checkout'. I received the suit 3 days later and eagerly tried it on. The 2-tone white on black is absolutely beautiful. The white material is heavy enough to not become see-through when wet and the padded cups, while being movable pads, are large enough to place where they do the most good! I am rather small, but coverage & support is there for considerably larger gals. I wondered if the halter ties at the neck and the mid-back might be a bit much, but they are actually not as big as they appear in the picture and don't distract at all from the suit. I tied the halter and used the back ties to snug up the sides of the suit. The black material fits nicely at the back and over the hips. The halter ties allow a bit of adjustment to the torso length, but even tied as tightly as possible, the bottom didn't ride up and was comfortable. I have a fairly long torso so I'm certain this suit wouldn't be a problem in that area for anyone else. Now to what I feel is the most helpful to you-my statistics! I am 5'7\", 140#s, 36\" (A-cup), 29\" waist, 38\" hips. I usually wear a size 6 or 8 pant, a size S sweater, M tee shirt, size 10 shirt and a M/8 dress-(unless it's a really form fitting jersey or ponte knit, then I order a L).\nAnyway, this is a really beautiful suit and for the price you can't go wrong as long as you measure and don't get thrown by the wacky sizing!", "summary": "Can't believe this suit looks SO good for so little money!!", "unixReviewTime": 1452124800}

This would be a great dress to pack for a flight!\n\nPros: Comfortable; lightweight; stretchy fabric; simple to accessorize with rhinestone and pearl jewelry; no ironing needed.\nCons: VERY thin (undergarments should be nude-colored to prevent them showing through); be wary of any rings or bracelets you may be wearing, as they can snag on the soft lace overlay (it's almost like some lace curtain fabrics); and it definitely is NOT white but ivory in color.\n\nThe only reason why I give this dress 4 rather than 5 stars is that is definitely NOT white in color as stated in the description, but IVORY. I was very disappointed by that, but found that could live with it because otherwise this dress was just what I wanted!", "summary": "Beautiful, comfortable, and flattering", "unixReviewTime": 1465689600}

I was looking for something to help me stand out a bit this year as I do my volunteer parade-marshal gig in our town's Holiday Parade, and this really fits the bill, so to speak. :)\n\nThe cap is very well-made, as high a quality as I've ever seen in any baseball-style cap. The 100% cotton material is quite heavy, backed by fabric interfacing at the front to help maintain shape. The pom pom on top is very substantial. The white trim around the bill is adequate, though it's the one thing that could ideally be a little heavier, but nevertheless looks good as is.\n\nThe cap is plenty large, fitting my 7-1/4\" head size without any problem at all, with lots of adjustment left to go bigger or smaller. The bill is quite large, with the trim making it seem even larger, so you'll certainly have no issues with shading your eyes.\n\nIt is definitely quite pricey, but I don't think it's out of line considering that it must be a fairly small-quantity item for the maker since it's so specific to the time of year. And it's going to last for years. In my case, I wouldn't have been happy with a lower-quality item, so I'm very content with my purchase.", "summary": "High-Quality Happy Holidays Hat!", "unixReviewTime": 1510272000}

I am a huge man of steel fan and I was a bit hesitant in ordering this from Cody lundin because I thought it be a fake compression shirt or something. But this is very similar to underarmour compression shirts with a great price. I did a few workouts with this and with my underarmour shirt and both do a good job and maintain breathable movement when lifting heavy in the gym. I've gotten many complements on this shirt and when i tell people how much it cost they tell me they just gotta have it. Simply amazing material. Im ordering the captain America one and another one right now. I feel like Henry cavill ( Man of steel) in this shirt. I love this shirt and cody lundin have out done themselves. I highly recommend this shirt to anyone. 5 stars all the way baby. Oh and one more thing I orderd medium because I have a slim muscular body with a small waist. But for those of you who are a bit taller or bigger I suggest ordering a size bigger. But don't forget this is a compression shirt so it will be skin tight.

He likes to wear his watch all the time unless he is showering so maybe that is an issue with the battery charge - I don't know.  In any case, I got this little LED charger (basically a bright flashlight in a stable setting) for him, and he has been delighted with it.

It appears to be working with most any standard USB charger unit for phones or tablets. I like the idea that it can be used as a flashlight with 2 X AAA batteries.

Each one can be powered in three ways:\n\n1.  Mini USB cable.\n2.  4.5 V DC power supply.\n3.  2 AAA batteries.\n\nWhen you use the AAA batteries, only four of the LEDs will light up.  I don't know how well the four LEDs charge a solar watch because I only tested my chargers with the batteries to make sure that the battery terminals were making good contact.  I never ran them for any length of time with the AAA batteries.  For the long term test, I powered my two chargers with one of these Vivitar USB chargers that has two 2 A USB outputs:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B005GCMYAG/ref=cm_cd_asin_lnk\n\nNote that if you plan on getting a dual USB output charger similar to what I bought, look carefully at the current output through the two USB ports.  I found that most of the units do not have a full 2 A output from both USB ports.  Most of them have 2 A from one and 1 A from the second one.  Ideally, you want as much current as possible (2 A) from both USB ports.  The Vivitar one that I mentioned above was one of the few with that option.  Despite what the Amazon reviewers said, I have had absolutely no problems with the one that I bought.\n\nThe solar watch LED chargers are made from very thin black plastic and they are very light weight.  I would not even think about taking them on vacation with me because I don't think that they'd survive bouncing around in a suitcase.  They are plenty durable enough for what I intend to do with them though - sit on my dresser and charge up my Casio, Seiko, and Citizen solar watches once a month.\n\nI put two of my most favorite Citizen Eco Drive dive watches on the new chargers: my Eco Zilla and my Promaster Aqualand Depth Meter diver.  Both watches rested on top of the chargers' rubber bezels without extending beyond the bezels' outer edges.  The chargers' rubber bezels are great because they did not scratch my watch bezels.  The LED chargers worked great!  I have never run my solar watch batteries down very far (that will shorten the life of them) but my depth meter dive watch has a power reserve meter on it and it was down to about 75% charge before I started my test.  After about three hours on the LED charger, the meter was up to a full 100%.\n\nEven though my two watches were fully charged up, I decided to leave them on the LED chargers for a full 24 hours.  After sitting on the chargers for the full 24 hours, my watches were only a little bit warm and not dangerously so.  This is a major benefit to using these LED chargers versus leaving solar watches on a windowsill where they can really cook.  Also, unlike sunlight, LEDs do not give out UV light so they will not fade watch dials and hands.  Fading hands is a big problem with some Citizen Eco Drive dive watches with bright orange minute hands if they are left on a windowsill repeatedly for recharging.\n\nThe chargers come with two different sized rubber bezels.  Supposedly one is for woman's watches and one is for men's watches.  I only used the larger one for men's watches and it worked just fine.  It was able to accommodate both my largest watch (the 50 mm Aqualand Depth Meter BN2021-03E diver that I ran my first test on) and my smallest watch (a 40 mm Citizen BN0000-04H diver.)  Both fit just fine though the larger watch rested on the highest top surface of the rubber bezel, while the smaller one fit down low inside the bezel on its sloped/inclined surface.  All of my other solar powered watches in between those sizes fit just fine on the chargers.\n\nWhen resting my large Aqualand Depth Meter and Eco Zilla watches on the chargers, the bumps on the surfaces of the bezels caused the bezels to not sit 100% flush against the chargers' rubber bezels all the way around.  Those gaps between the watch bezels and charger bezels let some of the light from the LEDs shine out and into my bedroom.  My wife complained about the light on the ceiling last night when she was first went to bed but after she shut her eyes, she fell asleep in a few minutes.  She slept just fine throughout the night so the light spilling out from the chargers may seem like a lot at first, but once you close your eyes you won't notice it.  My smaller watches like the 40 mm Citizen diver I mentioned before that fit within the bezel did not have nearly as much light spill out.  Also, in theory, a watch bezel that is perfectly smooth will rest completely flush against the charger bezel and prevent any light from shining out and into the room.  None of my solar watches have smooth bezels so I did not get the chance to test out that theory.\n\nSo I give these little solar watch chargers two thumbs up.  For what they are, they're not the cheapest things out there, but if they keep my solar watch batteries from going dead and keep my watch hands and dials from fading, they're a great buy.\n\nSome of the negative comments/reviews for these solar chargers say to just leave solar watches on a window sill to recharge them.  Here is my reply to that idea:\n\nPutting a solar watch on a window sill exposes it to lots of UV light. That harsh UV light can fade the dial and hands if they are brightly colored, as are the minute hands on several of my solar diving watches. There are pictures on the internet of badly faded dive watch dials and hands from people that made the mistake of using a window sill to recharge their watches. Unlike sunlight, LEDs like what are used in this charger do not give out a lot of UV light (some sources say that LEDs do not put out any UV light) and thus they will not fade anything that they illuminate. Also, if you have a Citizen Eco Drive watch, the instructions clearly state to avoid charging the watch in an area that becomes hot like a car dashboard. A window sill in direct sunlight can easily become just as hot as a dashboard. Too much heat is not good for the movement in solar watches.\n\nOf course, you can just wear a solar watch to recharge it (unless you're nocturnal) but when you're a watch collector, usually you have too many watches in your collection and your solar ones only come up in the rotation every few months at most. As a result they don't get the necessary wrist time to sufficiently keep their batteries fully charged between the times that they are worn.  Letting solar watch batteries die repeatedly will drastically shorten their life.  As others have found out the hard way, these chargers will not fix a completely dead rechargeable battery in a solar watch.", "summary": "Just what I need.", "unixReviewTime": 1493683200}

My most recent purchase was a Casio Pro Trek that has remained on Med. since I got it.  I also have a Citizen Eco Drive and a Casio Waveceptor solar/atomic watch.  I had a hard time deciding to spend the money for this item, I mean sunlight is free, but in the end talked myself into it.  The greatest impetus had to do with my Waveceptor watch which has been in the box for 3 years and my desire to get my Pro Trek up to \"High\".  I've basically been away from home for the last three years where I left my Waveceptor in the box before I left but, hopefully, this charging light will get it back up and running, and it took less than an hour to get my Pro Trek to a high charge.  Thus I know it works.  I decided the cost to maintain the three watches will amortize out over time and it does feel good to know I can easily maintain their charges without any \"gymnastics\".  As others have said, it's made of plastic and it's very light however it seems made well enough.  I used the large rubber adapter for the Pro Trek which was the correct size and it kept the watch from being in direct contact with the glass covering the light.  Again, if it holds up over time, the cost not to have to worry about any hassles keeping my solars on full charge will be worth it.  I will probably never use it with batteries nor use it as a flashlight.  I have numerous flashlights and numerous USB charging stations.

Let's get one thing straight. 30k lux is not \"similar to direct summer sunlight\". Summer sunlight would be more in the 45k-55k lux range. It's not a \"precision\" device.. rather.. lightweight plastic. What you might expect in a childrens toy from the dollar store. It's not heat free. (It's not the LED's that produce heat, but rather the resistors and control circuits driving the LED's that create heat.) That just goes to the overall lack of quality in the product.\n\nWhat it is. The only viable/convenient/versatile solution for solar watch charging on the market.. IT WORKS.. it works extremly well.. and is very affordable when considering cost/benefit. While less than \"direct summer sunlight\".. it is constant available light 24/7, several times more powerful than sun through a window and exponentially more powerful than a standard light bulb.\n\nLet me stress \"constant\". Providing a constant rate of charge will prolong the life of your watches power supply.\n\nDoes it need to be a precion instrument? No. Once your watch is fully charged it likely won't be used again more than once every few months.\nDoes the heat generated harm a solar watch in any way? No.\n\nObservations: As mentioned by others, the bezel pads leave a little to be desired. Even with my mid-large sized Protrek, it's a balancing act. One additional smaller and one additional larger pad would be nice to see.\n\nBattery compartment. It wasn't mentioned in the description, but was a very nice surprise to see the 2xAAA capability.

I kept my sleeve above the watch, I sat it in the window in full sunshine. In the summer it typically showed a full charge after a day outside but it just didn't last.\n\nCoolFire to the rescue! On the day I received it, I sat my watch on it overnight. It didn't synchronize the time (I usually set it on a brass lamp that seems to act like a receiving antenna.) but in the morning it showed a full charge.  Being a bit skeptical, I charged it overnight the next night as well.  I haven't used the CoolFire again and my watch is still showing a full charge. I haven't worried about my sleeves. It does the trick! I have the CoolFire in a standby-ready state in the nightstand drawer.\n\nThe charger comes with two adapters to fit the watch face size. The large one worked fine with mine. I positioned it near my bed and was not bothered at all by a very minimal light leak which I was able to \"aim\" away from me. The only negative I not is that it only comes with a USB power cord.

I'm a watch nut and I currently possess about 15 solar powered watches (among a total of 150 watches), and since I generally never wear the same watch more than once in a month or two,  my solar watches drain and go dead sitting in a darkened closet over a long period of non-use.  Like other watch collectors,  I've periodically taken my box of solar watches and cooked them on the patio for a day, but I sometimes forget.  What I like about this device is that it can be used to 'jump-start' a solar watch.  I place the watch on this device face-down, get ready for the day,  and by the time I head out the door about an hour later,  there's enough power to see me through the morning.  And as the day goes on, the watch continues to charge.  I've also placed two of these devices on top of the watch box face down (that is, pointing toward the faces of the dozens of watches inside the watch box) and after a few hours, all of the watches inside have enough juice to power them for weeks.  This is a lot simpler and more secure than toting the box downstairs and leaving them outside where they may be easily stolen.  I suppose you could perform the same tasks with a standard flashlight, but I believe these devices are optimized for the light wave length to which the watches best respond.  Pricey?  Maybe.

It's a very simple device that comes with 2 rubber adapters to use depending on the face size of your watch. It's powered by a USB cord or batteries. It took about 3hrs of charging to bring my ProTrek to full charge and the watch has maintained that level ever since. Will I use this product often? No, But if you don't use your watch for extended periods and the charge gets low, this is great product to quickly bring your watch up to a full charge.

I needed a little oomph for my Casio Protrek watch which had dipped to dangerously low power levels. I read the reviews on this unit and finally pulled the plug. The light came packaged nicely, and shipping was quick thanks to Prime.\n\nI must agree with a lot of the reviews out there. This unit feels cheap, looks cheap, and is grossly overpriced.  Having said that.......it does EXACTLY what its supposed to do. I placed my Protrek on this unit overnight and by morning it had a High charge and has remained that way every since. I used a Samsung phone charger instead of the provided cord and it worked perfectly. My watch was warm to the touch after 12 hours on charge but nothing that would case me concern. I would EASILY pay double this price for a better built light made out of aluminium or metals. My plan is to top up the charge whenever it dips to Medium....for that purpose this unit is excellent. I had no burnt out lights and it was blinding bright.\n\nThe unit is so light that it only lays flat when the watch was placed on it as a weight. I haven't found anything else like it so for now.....this unit has a monopoly on the aftermarket solar watch charging market.\n\n1 Star deduction for being overpriced and feeling cheaply made.", "summary": "IT DOES EXACTLY WHAT ITS SUPPOSED TO DO", "unixReviewTime": 1480377600}

Indoor lighting and sunshine through windows don't provide anywhere near the energy provided by direct full sunshine. If you leave your watch out in the full sun and the watch heats near or above 140F, the battery may degrade.\n\nSo, I ordered this solar watch recharger. It seems to work well.

Full sunlight lux varies, but 98,000 lux is a good standard.

It honestly looks like something I payed $30 -$40 for at a department store. The lace is good quality and the print is also excellent. Although I rated it it as \"fit as expected\", the sleeves were a bit shorter than shown in the picture but not tacky or awkward my any means. Also, it was a bit bigger/baggier than I expected but that is probably due to my small frame. I'm 5'4, 115 pounds and ordered a small. It's definitely a bit bigger than I would have liked but still looks fine. My BIGGEST complaint and annoyance is that when the item arrived it smelled AWFUL. I mean I could not even leave it on my body for more than 2 seconds because I could not stand the smell. It was atrocious! It was a sharp smell almost like rusted metal. It's honestly hard to put into words how awful it was. I left it in my bedroom for 5 minutes and when I came back, I had to open the windows to let the stench out. It did not come with washing instruction and due to the lace and the fabric being so light, I was not sure if it's machine safe so I ended up dunking in the tub. I let it soak for about an hour in nothing more than Dove soap. After about an hour, I scrubbed a bit and rinsed it several times and then hung to dry. Luckily, the atrocious smell was gone and I was able to properly try on the garment. In sum. for the low price, it's worth it which is why I gave it 4 stars. I don't think it's worth much more than that and had I paid more, I probably would have returned it because no new article of clothing should make one gag when received.", "summary": "The quality and look turned out to be MUCH better than I expected", "unixReviewTime": 1439942400}

Of course I first need to recharge the watch, but with an interior office and limited sunlight at home during the winter, setting the watch out in the sun for a few hours was not an option. I actually resorted to haunting my watch inside the fluorescent light fixture in the ceiling of my office, but even then it would take a couple of days for the watch to fully recharge.\n\nIt may feel a bit counterproductive to use electricity to recharge a solar watch - after all, the whole idea of a solar watch centers on ecology, but this device uses ultra-efficient LEDs and it plugs into as standard USB port. Plugged into an unused port on a computer, the power draw is minuscule, and yet it can recharge an Eco-Drive watch in a matter of hours.

I have a few solar watches and to be honest, they charge just fine. My Oceanus has never run low on charge even after sun deprivation...and I'm talking three months plus in a closed drawer. I pull it out and it springs to life. My Seiko Astron is another story. Got it fully charged and even with daily wear in sunny California it eventually dropped power until it wouldn't synchronize. Took a year and a half but it eventually happened. If I was outside frequently that would be a different story. But I'm not.  Bummer. These watches use a lot of power to synchronize with those pesky satellites. Leaving the watch in the sun heats it up unless it's strapped to your wrist to heat sink it. Plus it takes soooo long. This device fixes that. Easy to use and does a great job. As an engineer, I'm measuring all the necessary variables to see how good it works. Thus far, I can say it is brilliantly simple and easy to set up and use. It moved my Astrom from the third lowest charge to the second in 8 hours. It can now can talk to the satellites. It may be simple but it works. If you buy a solar power hog, you need this. Will update when I know more. I'm soooo happy right now I bought this life saver.\nIt took 3 days to get my Astron from the lowest setting to the highest. I will probably put the watch on one night a month and see how that goes.

I don't think that this is a dress you can wear while not pregnant, directly after birth maybe, but it's definitely maternity. All in all, a casual style that can be dressed up with jewelry or heels, but you can still wear out to the mall or the movies.", "summary": "Great Buy and Fit!", "unixReviewTime": 1451088000}

The lace on the bodice is very soft and even stretchy. The lace is delicate and adds some sensual sexiness to the outfit! It definitely goes down into a deep v on the front, but depending on your bust size, it will cover more or less. For me, it was pretty low on the front, but with the string on the halter, you can adjust it to make it a little more loose, or tighten it up so theres less give at the top.\n\nThere are tons of strings on the outfit, and it got kind of messy for me, because I was dressing myself. But if you get the halter tied on, when you go to put on the rest it is fine. The back of the outfit ties, (with the thin ribbon), but has enough (thick ribbon),  to tie around on the front. I do think that the thick ribbon piece looks better if it is tied around on the back, but that depends on if you have someone to tie it for you or if you can manage that on your own.\n\nThere are two pieces that go around your wrists, kind of like the cuffs on a traditional maids costume, if it was fully sleeved. They attach to each other or you can just tie the top in bows, but again, there is a lot string! That is the only downside to this outfit. The positive to this is that you can do whatever youd like when wearing it, because of all that string. I did not want my wrists or hands to be constricted so I did not tie them together. Tying them together adds a little bit of fun to your occasion, however.\n\nThe lace is not itchy, it is stretchy, and the ribbons are soft. I ordered a black color, but I did see that they offer a pink color as well. The black suits me so I am happy with this one. There is hardly any material on this sexy outfit, but it is good! I did not expect a covered up maid costume. Very sexy, and enjoyable in that it is flattering for me, I think it will be flattering for many people. I am 5 feet, with maybe two inches, and at 140 pounds, this makes me feel confident!\n\nI received this item at a deep discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased thorough review.", "summary": "Flattering for anyone!", "unixReviewTime": 1462838400}

You can feel them on the outside of your legs as you wear them and I can see how overtime they could rub the outside of your legs to the point of being sore.  I should admit, however, that I have only worn them twice so far, both times with fairly snug fitting jeans....I can imagine that they would likely be much more comfortable with a pair of men's dress slacks, so my comments shouldn't be construed as a negative.  My only concern is that the claws which grip the shirt are so strong and so effective at gripping the shirt that it would SEEM as though they could tear a hole in the shirt.  However, I can see no sign of this yet....this is pure speculation.  I can tell you that these work exactly as advertised and I plan to order a few more pairs of them, probably in one of their different configurations.  The ones I ordered have a stirrup that you put your foot through....the elastic then forks into two pieces which connect to two of the clamps which connect to the side and back of your shirt.

I imagine the current teeth are for thicker shirts while the new teeth are for thin button down shirts.\nGreat customer service and even a free second pair! One for work and one for home.

I can sit, bend over, jump, twist at work and my dress shirts never come out of being tucked in. I used to hate retucking my shirt all the time and after a while, it looks terrible.\n\nThe only reason why I gave it 3 stars is that after 2 weeks, one of the alligator clips stopped clamping tightly so that it would always fall off unless I rolled up my shirt and shoved it into the alligator clip that was loose. Will come back and change review if I get new ones where all the clips work. Sometimes it still falls out if I don't shove enough fabric in the flawed clamp and when one of these detaches, youll feel it walking around, like a piece of metal scraping your leg. Also, since these loop around the front of your foot and you clip the alligators as a Y on the side of your shirt, the stretchy string chaffs with the calf of your leg. I am not that hairy, but I noticed that a lot of leg hair was being chaffed off and irritated/fabric burn that I stopped using them after 3 days straight to relieve the fabric burn. If you get the ones that are truly Y shaped with 3 clips and clip to your sock and not loop around your foot you avoid this fabric burn problem. Some people might only use this twice a week so in that case it probably will be fine.\n\nThis product is also bad for people that have to use the bathroom a lot because it takes time to take these off and put back on, but that doesn't factor into my rating.", "summary": "Good except I got one that was ok", "unixReviewTime": 1474848000}

I was disappointed, considering these were $20.  I contacted Buttons & Pleats through Amazon to ask for a replacement.  They responded very quickly and said they would send another set out.  They also said:  \" please be aware that cheap shirt stays can be lasted for less than 1 month, our product are designed to be last for 2-3 months.\n That mean it is normal to purchase new pack every 3 months.\"\n\nIf you look above at the description of the product it says:  \"SURE GRIP CLIPS - Nylon teeth keep a tight hold on your clothing, ensuring a no-fail grip.\" and \"Made to stand the test of time, the BUTTONS & PLEATS Shirt Stays are a solution that you can count on to keep your shirt tucked in.\"\n\n- The grip has failed on me after 2 months.\n-2 months is not what any reasonable person would consider to be the \"test of time.\"\n\nIf the manufacturer was more transparent that these are disposable and need frequent replacement, it would have played a role in my decision whether to drop $20 on them.  I really like what they do until they stop doing it.\n\nOriginal Review:\nThis review is for the foot loop style.  The clips work great and hold your shirt in place all day.  I was concerned about the elastic being noticeable when seated but it hasn't been an issue.\n\nThe one BIG problem that I couldn't deal with were the buckles.  When sitting at my desk or driving (I commute about 40 minutes to work, each way, every day), the plastic buckles dug into the side of my right thigh and were painfully uncomfortable.  Just for reference, I'm not a huge guy.  I'm about 5'7\" and 195 lbs.  I ended up removing the buckles and sewing the top and bottom section together at the right length for me and it's significantly more comfortable.  I wouldn't have been able to wear them out of the box, long term.", "summary": "Clips are great until they fail after 2 months, buckles dig into my legs", "unixReviewTime": 1440115200}

I got these and sadly was very disappointed.\n\nFirstly, although I cannot point you to the set I bought - it seems to no longer be offered - the images show three of the 8 pairs with what looks like red. In reality it is bright pink. The boyfriend likes pink but doesn't want to wear it. I know monitors can show different things to different users but a bunch of pink socks when not expecting them is a disappointment.\n\nSecondly, I bought socks that fit mens shoes sizes 7-12. The socks looked a little on the small side but okay. Then I washed them on cold and tumbled on low heat with a moisture sensor. I am very careful with clothes to keep them nicer for longer, but these socks shrank BIG TIME. These men's shoe size 7-12 do not fit my bf, who wears a 10.5-11. They fit me. I mean perfectly fit me without a stitch of bagginess or extra give. I wear a boy's size 5.5.\n\nSo, basically I now have a bunch of socks I wouldn't have picked for me. A bunch of pink men's patterned socks. Oh well, I guess I can wear them around the house and not care about padding outside in them when it's cold to do laundry in the garage or get the dogs inside.\n\nThe quality - aside from the radical shrinking and color inaccuracy is pretty nice. The socks are well sewn - or knitted? - and haven't fallen apart or give the impression that they will do so. The patterns are well-rendered. Just don't bank on these being men's sized socks. And if they don't look really big enough - like maybe too big - don't wash them - return them. I should have done this, but alas, I wasn't thinking they would shrink so darned badly. Oh well. You live and learn.\n\nNote: I've added some pics of my 5.5 size (that's the size I fit in boys - I am a ladies size 7.5) next to my boyfriend's boot that is under the size of the largest size these socks are supposed to fit by 1- 1.5 sizes (he wears mens 10.5 or 11 depending) to show the size issue and another close up to show how perfectly snug and comfy these are on my comparatively little feet.

I don't see those three lasting a month.\n\nAside from that, I am fairly unimpressed. The material isn't thin, exactly, but the socks I bought at Walmart for two bucks a pair feel far more luxurious.\n\nOn the positive side, the design is sewn in with different colored threads. So the patterns are going to last. On the negative side, there is a lot of extraneous thread on the inside.
