He loves watching YouTube videos on Five Nights at Freddys, and he had seen a Freddy Fazbear badge advertised on one of the sites. So, I turned to Amazon, and of course I found this badge. Honestly, I wasn't sure that it would be worth $15, but as I received, I found that the badge appeared to be in good shape, and made with good quality metal. It wasn't made with flimsy or cheap plastic. The badge attached to his shirt, and almost weighs down the cotton (it might be better to wear this badge with a more solid, stronger shirt or vest). The backing of the pen was easy to unhook and hook, and the clasp really hooks the pin in tight so it won't get loose or fall off of his shirt. The only thing I didn't like with the pin piece is that it is quite long, and the sharp metal pin would bother my son as he was wearing it. This part needs to be a little shorter, but other than that, my son is having a blast with this!\n\n4/16/16 UPDATE: I'm updating my review to say that while my son had fun with this pin, it only lasted 2 months!! The pin backing came off, and we're not able to hook it back on. It's really disappointing that he can't continue to wear it. I guess this pin would be okay for a one time use at a birthday party or other event, but it's not going to last for kids wanting to continue to wear it/play with it.

This is no exception, except for the fact that it doesn't exactly look like the sweater dress pictured.

After receiving this, I noticed that it doesn't hang off the shoulder at all, it's more of a boatneck collar, which is fine, just not what I was expecting. I did contact Zxzy about returning the dress and they were very accommodating in the process and asked very specific questions about what I expected from my original purchase, how I thought it could be changed to be more like the dress represented, etc. They did quickly process my exchange and re-sent me a larger size(I was hoping a larger size would offer me more room in the shoulders to make it \"off shoulder\", it didn't~But, it's still really cute on). The shipping was much faster than originally estimated, and the exchange was even faster than the original!

It's a beautiful dress but it was just... off. If that makes sense? The bottom was way too long, and I don't understand that since I gave my measurements and height. The middle fit well enough. The top part was a disaster. You don't wear a strapless bra with it, and I was fine with that since there was plenty of support. It was almost like they took a chest frame and sewed it in there haha. I don't really know how to explain it. So after fooling with it, we got it zipped. The thing was practically sideways on me. The one shoulder had to practically leave the room to straighten up the rest of the dress. You can't cut it and resew the top because of weird boob plate thing. So basically the dress was useless to us and I decided to send it back. Luckily the seller did say I could have a refund if I sent the dress back. This is where I should have been more careful on who I was ordering from, because in order to send it back - to China! -  I'd need to pay $65! I'd already spent $100 on it, plus an additional $25 or 30 to rush it, and now another $65 to send it back?! Plus they said it would be at least 5-6 weeks to receive it. I said forget it.

Unfortunately, I will be returning both of them.\n\nFirst, the positives:\nThis dress is very pretty. The green was exactly as pictured and the lace is very nice. The dress appears to be well made and the fabric has a nice weight to it.\n\nUnfortunately, even going by the size guide for the dress, I found the dress to be significantly smaller than advertised. In particular, it's about 3\" shorter than it says. I ordered a 12, which according the size guide should be 60\" long. I measure the dress on a hanger at 57\" from shoulder to hem. On me, it hangs about 55.5\" from the shoulder. I'm 5'7\" and measure 58\" from shoulder to floor so this doesn't work, even if I'm not wearing heels. The bust is also about an inch smaller than advertised. I am very busty (34DD) and I measure about 39.5\" with a bra on, so I was expecting it to be a little bit tight, as the listed measurement is 38.5\". I was not expecting to be squished completely flat. Measuring over the dress, I measured the bust at closer to 37.5\". The measurements for the waist and hip seem to be accurate, and there's enough stretch to accommodate my 43\" hips without it pulling too tight.\n\nIf I had only ordered one of these dresses, I might chalk the differences up to poor quality control or a fluke. But I ordered two in different colors and both fit exactly the same.\n\nIt's also worth noting that (at least on me) the V in the neck comes down pretty low. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I wasn't expecting it to be as low as it was based on the picture.\n\nOverall, it is a really nice dress, especially for the price, and has the potential to be very flattering on someone whose measurements match the dress.\n\nI've attached pictures.

They style is great I just wish the zippers worked better. They are low quality zippers and don't close at all. The big compartment zipper works ok and so does the lower zipper on the front side(although I'm careful not to over-stuff). The zipper on the top is the one that does not close at all; im so disappointed because the zipper started to malfunction just a week into owning the bag. I thought i would just deal with it but i cant. Since the zipper does not close that compartment just hangs wide open so I cant put anything in there because it falls off. 4\n\nAlso the bag is not water proof at all. I got caught in the rain the other day and all my stuff on the top got wet.\n\nWhen I  finally decided to return I was informed that returns are no longer available on this product. I am very dissatisfied with my purchase.", "summary": "Bad zippers, not water proof and not returnable", "unixReviewTime": 1457827200}

Cl.", "reviewText": "I am updating my review, and adding 2 more stars.  CoolBell reached out to me after reading my review, and offered to refund 1/2 the price of the bag (which I though a little odd), or to resend me another bag as they felt the defect that I had found was an anomaly.  I choose the later option.  My bag arrived promptly, and I've had several days to use it now.\n\nI still affirm that the bag is cute, and the laptop compartment is nicely padded.  Now that I've had a 2nd try, it is more functional than I thought before.  I like that it stands up on it's own without needing a wall or leg to lean on when you set it down.  The weather has become much colder so I haven't felt if the straps are doing less damage on my shoulders than they did before.  The bag holds a little less than the bag that I am replacing, but I'm replacing that bag because it put too much strain on my neck.  This bag does not have that issue, and that may be in part because I can't put as much junk in it.  However, it has been able to hold my computer, a change of gym clothes, makeup, and sneakers when needed.\n\nThe cons are the front pockets and (still) the zippers.  Not only did the front zippers break on the first bag, but on the 2nd bag, one of the main compartment zipper popped open once.  It was the first time I was closing the bag with something in it (not much stuff either), and it split.  However, unlike with the first bag, I was able to back the zipper up, and rezip it normally.  Since then I have put a LOT more stuff in the bag, and not had the zipper issue . . . however, now that I know the zippers are on the risky side, I am VERY careful to open and close them slowly.  Not sure if they'll last forever.  The front pockets are very tight, and tricky to get things in and out of.  I think they have to be like that in order to keep the nice structured shape, but I wouldn't count on being able to put a ton in there.\n\nSo basically, I add a star to prompt & courteous customer service, and another start for the effectiveness of the 2nd bag (though I'm careful with those zippers).  One other item . . . for those that are obsessed with buying American made products - this isn't one of them.  The tags on the bags are in an asian language, and when customer service contacted me, they were definitely using something like Google Translator - it made for some charming misuses of language.  But like I said, they were very courteous, and, most importantly, they seem to care a lot about their product.  It wouldn't surprise me at all if, after reading this review, they find a way to strengthen the zippers for future bags.\n\n******************************************************************************\nI give this bag 2 stars because it is cute, & someone may not care that much about functionality. The laptop compartment is nicely padded. But that's it for pros. It's on its maiden voyage with me now, & the 2 front zippers are already broken, the straps are made of something that feels like sandpaper (my neck looks like it has raspberries on it), and it has zero ergonomic factor...by neck is killing me. I had hoped that this would double as a gym bag, but there is very little room in it. I have a couple of books, a computer & my computer charger in it now, and I wouldn't dare try to fit more in. This will definitely be returned as soon as I get home. Very disappointed.", "summary": "Nice Bag for the Price", "unixReviewTime": 1451520000}

I followed up each time. I still don't have the needed part to securely close my Ainifeel bag.\n\nWithout the clasp, the bag is unusable and sadly must go in the trash since no replacement parts have been made available to me. Who wants to rock a purse that won't even close?\n\n I scored the purse one star, because even at a $110 price point, the bag should hold up for longer than three wears.

The top is a long sleeved white shirt with an attached tie. The tuxedo part is only in the front of the shirt - the back of the shirt is all white. The bottom piece is pin-striped tuxedo pants.\n\nThe top of the outfit is very cute, and the tuxedo vest part has a pinstripe design, as well as buttons and 2 'look-alike' pockets. The pockets are just for looks, they can't really be used, as its sewn shut. The buttons are cute, but look kind of tacky in my opinion. I would have liked to see buttons that are not quite so cheap looking. The tie that is attached to the shirt is also slightly misaligned, so it lays just a little to the side instead of right down the middle of the shirt. I don't think that it is noticeable unless you would be holding the baby, itself. Any further and it will look just fine!\n\nThe pants have to be my favorite part of the outfit. They actually have real pockets, so the baby can carry his favorite toy car, or maybe a binky when you leave the house. The top of the pants are stretchy, so if you have a baby that is a little chunky (which, they all seem to be, :-) ) the pants will stretch and not fit tight on baby.\n\nThe pinstripes are all lined up straight, and the material in the outfit is super soft and comfy!\n\nOver all, this is a great outfit for baby to wear for a birthday party, holiday get-together, or nice outing! It is also a great gift for a baby shower, or baby's birthday!

When he was wearing this outfit, he got more compliments then never on how adorable and handsome he looked.\n I absolutely love the quality of the material. It's going really well and even the little guy that's on there is a text so you don't have to worry about missing accessories that complete the outfit. It's probably my favorite outfit I've ever put on my son. It's really posh and definitely on trend. And even though it is long sleeve, it's got a nicer t-shirt type material for the long sleeve that's pretty thin so you can still wear it in warmer months. My friend asked to wear it all the time. It's not only my favorite but his as well.\n One thing I will mention is about sizing. He's a larger 2 year old so he wears between a 3 and a 4 in most cases. I got him a size 4 because I wasn't sure on sizing. It actually was a little bit big for him but not as big as I expected it to be. My recommendation would be to buy one size up like I did and I'm really glad I did because he should be able to wear it for quite a while.\n I received this adorable faux tuxedo outfit at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "My new favorite for my son", "unixReviewTime": 1463011200}

But the sewing is horrible, and I'm not even picky. I took off stars because the buttons are hot glued onto the red tie, and there were strings of dried glue all over the tie because of it.

I could even see my son's diaper pattern through the holes in the seam when he put these pants on. There are no care instructions on the shirt or pants, so I have no idea how to wash these but I'm guessing I don't - this seems like a one time outfit, to wear once and not wash or it will fall apart. The \"idgirl\" tag sewn onto the hem of the shirt was sewn on hastily and crooked, and I had to cut it off because it stuck out from under the shirt. The tie is loosely sewn on to the shirt, and I was able to use just my fingers to pull it off (which I had to do, to fully remove the glue strings). The shirt actually works better without the tie. For the price, all of this is to be expected, but the quality is so low I wouldn't use this for a formal event like a wedding. It's more suited to a quick Easter egg hunt or an hour long visit with family.

It's stiff and not a nice cut for the material.\n\nAdded bonus, one of my straps was completely busted before I even attached it to the purse.\n\nJust...don't.

The handles are about an inch too short to be able to sling it onto your shoulder without using the long attachable strap.  The zipper is a PITA because at the end it's not sewn down or attached to anything for about 5 inches.  When you open the bag then want to re-zip it the zipper twists itself over and under so you can't zip it without pulling the 5 inch piece out then twisting it back to its original and right shape.  The canvas itself is of good quality.  I'll make some personal alterations such as remove the big rings on the sides and fix the zipper situation somehow.

Second is the quality.  I actually ordered 3 sweaters at the same time (same style, same color) and every single one of them is a different quality, different material, and different fabric?!?  Even the cuffs are different.  2 were just the thin (VERY THIN) material folded over and 1 has a ribbed material for the cuff.  The fabric is so thin if you're wearing a T-shirt with words on it underneath you'd have no problem reading it.  1 sweater had about 10 unfinished seams and threads hanging everywhere.  The other two just had very poorly sewn seams.  To be honest, when I opened the package it looked like a elementary school home ec project gone terribly wrong.  The item is shipped from China so you can't return it.  I was offered $3.50 for a refund, and to keep the item.  So I'm out about $45 (for three) and have a wad of fabric I can't imagine using for any other purpose.  You get what you pay for.

I generally will wear scarves, hats, and wide headbands to cover the bald and thin spots at the front and sides of my head. This is the first time I have tried a pre-tied scarf and was eager to see how it compared to a regular scarf. First off, it comes wrapped in tissue paper with a nice little bow on it, so it can easily be given as a gift as-is. Second, the material is soft and the royal blue chiffon is a beautiful, vivid color. I have a pair of pants the exact same color that go perfectly with it. The tie in the back is actually an elastic piece that holds its shape and allows it to stretch. There is also another tie on the back that I believe is supposed to be for getting a custom fit.\nUnfortunately, I found a couple of things that I thought were bothersome. The scarf is basically a one size fit all, but I found that it was a little too large for my head and even with the tie on the back, it is really hard to get a custom fit because where the elastic is situated. Also, even with hair, the scarf shifted and slid around on my head as I was going about my day and I had to keep adjusting it. I know that this could be easily remedied by purchasing a wig or scarf gripper which is basically a headband that prevents that issue, but I don't have one at the moment.\nI do like the scarf. I like the color of it, the material, the fact that I can just throw it on in a hurry, but I think that overall, a regular scarf is easier to customize. It can be tied to your head as tight as you want, but a wig gripper may do the trick as well.

I'm female, 5'4\" around 138-ish lbs and I purchased a men's small. It fits just fine, like many other of my men's small 'design/logo' type shirts. I know they have women's styles, but it's like it's next to impossible for them to make a women's cut in the same designs as the guy's stuff. Sometimes I like the designs on the men's shirts better.\nThis shirt is definitely for a person with a long(er) torso (or perhaps taller than I); the shirt comes down to about mid-thigh on me, where as other brands/styles of Men's shirts fall at my hip. And I do/can roll the sleeve up, but that pretty common for me with men's tees.\nThe shirt is pretty soft and does not appear to shrink much after the wash; which is great (but, personally, this time I was kind of hoping it would, just to fit a little shorter on me). The silk screen has held up nicely after three washes (though I wash it cold, inside out on light or medium settings). Though I cannot vouch for the dryer setting, as the dial is broken so it only has one setting-- on; which works well enough for me for now- as long as it dries the clothes. I do not have space to hang my clothes to dry somewhere.\n\nThe only real complaint about this shirt is that the tan \"F8\" logo is a bit sticky. Now it does not make your fingers sticky and it does not stick to itself after the wash; but you can feel it. I don't really know how else to describe it. I don't think I really would have noticed it much, but I had the shirt on while I was watching my nephew. And since he is only 13m, he notices everything and he just couldn't stop touching the \"F8\" logo; it was like his entertainment for the day. He was glued to my hip or on my lap most of the day because all he wanted to do was keep touching the logo. I actually found it a bit funny (and bit tiring because he weighs well over 25 lbs and is three feet tall, so he's pretty awkward to hold for long periods of time).", "summary": "A men's small is nice for women", "unixReviewTime": 1502496000}

Salzenstein", "reviewText": "I hate giving 2-stars or fewer, but in this case I had to - because the name of the item is complete rubbish, misleading and incorrect.  There may be no RAISED seams on the OUTSIDE of these tights/compression pants, but there are very clear, defined and scratchy seams on the inside - in the crotch and down the entire leg.  I was SUPER disappointed, especially given the title, because I bought these for my nephew, who struggles with sensory overload issues... in order to get him to wear most any pants, he has to wear tights, leggings or similar bottoms under jeans, etc. because the seams irritate him to the point that he's crying, screaming and throwing the pants on the ground.  Obviously these did not work.\n\nTo be fair to the brand, the quality seemed great - fabric, fit, cut, etc... all good.  But they are NOT \"seamless\" by any means, and that was both a bummer and source of major annoyance, since I had to repack them, make a trip to the post and send them back.", "summary": "NOT \"seamless\"", "unixReviewTime": 1479600000}

With a sturdy comb mount, you can place it at my points in your front, back and side. I would recommend adding a few bobby pins or gator clips to steady it, especially if you are not used to placing them. This is easy to wear but your confidence goes up when you know your hairstyle and accessories don't need to be checked continually. Sometimes I wear things around the house to give things a test run, practical but fun. If you have a long and/or a lot of hair, this will look somewhat smaller on you and will be more bold on someone with shorter or finer hair. I have very long thick hair that I rolled up for the pictures.\n\nPros:\n\n~  Well made\n~ Lightweight for easy wear\n~ Versatile style that can be semi casual to formal\n\nCons:\n\n~  A small box or pouch to store this in, to protect it and make it feel special, would really add to it's charm\n\nOverall, this is a lovely piece that will lend itself to many occasions and make the lady wearing it stand out over many years.\n\nI received a discounted sample for evaluation to allow me to offer you my thoughts and opinions. Real life use and POV descriptions from other customers are important to me and often what helps me make my choice.  I hope this helps you.", "summary": "Beautiful", "unixReviewTime": 1469145600}

According to the sizing info in the product description, these fit my 38\" hips but realistically, these are not a comfortable fit because they are too tight.\n\nThese are listed to be seamless on the packaging but they are not (see photo). The way these are cut, I wouldn't wear them like regular leggings or pants that are okay to bend over in... Because of their cut, like pantyhose, they'd look silly. So they're thick like pants but cut like your booty should definitely not be seen.\n\nThese are super soft, inside and out and they do stretch but I'd recommend them for a US size 4 or smaller (or a size 6 if you don't have wide hips).\n\nI rated these 3 stars because although they appear to be well made and there are no loose seams, I don't think the pantyhose like cut is appropriate for a fur-lined winter wear type product.\n\nI think their look is pretty. Only when you put them on can you see they're really shimmery. I gave these as a gift to my teenage niece who loves everything bright and fun. As an adult, I wouldn't wear these.\n\nWould recommend to others for quality but only considering the above because, of course, it depends on your preferences! I will update this review later down the road should these not hold up well for my niece.\n\nWe've had them for a little over two months without any problems.

I loved the look at style of the dress, but upon arrival, the color wasn't quite as pictured but still a wonderful coral color.

I bought a size 4 due to the measurement suggestions and I'm 5' 2\" and roughly 130 lbs. I also suggest pairing with a sash or belt due to the tighter fit- its fine without if you go with the bigger size. Length wise, it's of a decent length and could easily be paired with a pair of leggings or shorts - depending on what kind of look you are going for.

The grey material is a light, whitish hue that is very similar to the photo on Amazon. The lace comes up to a few inches under the bust, leaving just enough room to accessorize with a belt to complete the look. One of the coolest features of the top is that the lace is not just around the bottom, but also comes up in triangular peaks that are also filled with a slightly different white lace. The shape of the lace peaks gives the \"skirt\" portion a nice flow and flounce. The lace itself is pure white and reminds me of a gorgeous wedding veil, but in shirt form. The lace has rose and other floral motifs that add even further feminine flair. I think my favorite part about this top is the actual material itself! The grey shirt is so soft and comfortable to wear. It's just heavy enough to provide some warmth, but it isn't so heavy as to feel restrictive in movement.\n\nPros\n-Gorgeous white lace with floral motifs\n-Shirt material is incredibly comfortable\n-The \"skirt\" has nice flow as you move\n\nCons\n-I have long arms, so the sleeves are a little shorter than I would normally look for in the \"perfect\" outfit, but that is just being nitty gritty picky.\n\nI'm really happy that I was able to receive this top at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.", "summary": "Gorgeous Lace Embellished Top", "unixReviewTime": 1465948800}

I did have to take off one star, because my piece is bigger than most, and this case is a bit too small for The Lord Your God.\n\nFor some reason, I have been getting funny locks from the other guys at the bar, and they keep making comments about a \"man purse\" and impugning my masculinity. But I know I have The Lord Your God with me at all times, and He is Bigger than any of them. They are just jealous that I was the first one to get this amazing concealed carry case.", "summary": "A bit snug for The Lord Your God", "unixReviewTime": 1449878400}

Allow these stone plugs to be of assistance, and you'll be flashing everyone in no time. Read on for further details.\n\nThese plugs are just a touch longer than I expected them to be, as was previously suggested by some of the other reviewers, but it doesn't bother me. They look and feel so nice! The finish gives them such a nice gloss that they flash a glare as you move, under the right lighting conditions, unlike the black, plastic plugs I had in before. I, honestly, didn't think it would make that much of a difference, appearance wise, but it does. You really can see a difference, just in the way that they shine. The plastic ones don't look the same. The edges are so soft, smooth, and rounded, which makes them much easier to put in.\n\nFYI, I'm new to 0g (I was at 2g forever!), and I've never tried these stone plugs before. There are very few options if you're not, at least, at 0. Additionally, there really was no point in trying to stock up on jewelry that would soon be too small. I figured I should just wait if I planned on eventually getting to 0g anyway. Anyhow, the flared edge was a bit of a pain to push through at first, but once it was in, it actually felt good. Kind of like, for any one that lifts weights, when you push a muscle really hard, the way it feels when the blood rushes through it once you've stopped, and it doesn't hurt anymore. I don't know... maybe I'm just weird. Lol. Needless to say, they are probably not going to fall out, as the edge is just wide enough to hurt. Wow, the end of that last sentence sounded quite provocative... but I digress.\n\nAnyhow, I definitely recommend these. No sizing issues for me with these ones. They're just right. Excellent quality and at a fantastic price. Can't beat that. I love them, and I'm very happy with my purchase. Thanks, Mystic Metals!", "summary": "EARLOBE-FLASHING...", "unixReviewTime": 1510272000}

How the heck am I supposed to figure out what model I have so that I can get another? Very annoying.\n\nAside from this being the wrong one, it was also noticeably and unacceptably larger than the one I have... even though they are listed as the exact same size. Lastly, even though I knew this to be the case before I bought it, the light grey underside of the bill doesn't make sense to me. I'd rather it match the color of the hat, for one thing, but apart from that it doesn't make sense because the lighter color reflects more light into your eyes. That kinda goes against the point of wearing this! If the hat had otherwise been what I wanted, this wouldn't have been a deal-killer... but it's worth mentioning to others as a head's-up.\n\nAlso, FYI, this thing has a higher profile than you might think from the photo and description. It's listed as \"mid pro,\" but to me it seems more like high profile.\n\nThree stars due to the inconsistent sizing, light-color underside, and FlexFit not including model numbers in their hats.", "summary": "FlexFit needs improvement in a few ways", "unixReviewTime": 1478476800}

I love vests and have about 10 different ones that I wear all the time and the XL fits just right with just a touch of belly room. This vest leaves no room so I would recommend going up on size if you plan on leaving it zipped while eating.\n\nThe Cons: 1. If you are looking for an exact replica of Chris Pratts vest, this is not it. The most obvious change is the height of the zipper compared to the pockets. But there are about 6 discrepancies I found.\n  2. Pockets are for decoration only as they are too small for anything other than a pack of gum\n  3. You can get the exact same vest for cheaper from Jacket Fans and save yourself $57.00.\n  4. When I called this to the attention of Fjackets, I was promptly (they responded to my email very quickly) told they would refund the difference between their vest and the one sold by other company however that was on May 11, 2016. I was very impressed with their response, however it is now July 3rd and the refund still hasn't happened so I will give fjackes a ONE star and the vest a 3 star.", "summary": "It is a kind of nice vest and well made even if it is a ...", "unixReviewTime": 1467504000}

You get what you pay for. It's cotton, which is cheaper than synthetics or wool, bit you loose certain features such as warmth if you get wet (from snow, rain, or sweat).\n\nIt fit is VERY small. You want thermals to fit close, but not this close. It'll probably be unwearable once it is washed. Also the slaves are really short. I wear between a 33 and a 34 inch on my dress shirts & the arms on the large size hit about where I would wear a watch. Meh. I generally prefer a longer sleave, but it keeps them out of sight.\n\nThe length of the shirt is nice though. I prefer a two piece thermal & this hasn't come untucked on me yet.\n\nThe material is very thin. Again, not a bad thing if the material & weave make up for it. But this fails to trap air & keep it warm against your body.  Perhaps if you order a size or two larger, it'll do a little better, but because it runs so small, the material is stretched tight.\n\nConclusion - if you want a little something extra in cool (not cold) temps, this is ok for the price. But my suggestion is to save your money & invest in a much higher quality set of thermals.", "summary": "small, thin, & a poor weave - but cheap", "unixReviewTime": 1454025600}

This one honestly isn't that much better.  I like the idea of a lot of pockets but when you start filling those pockets, you realize that it's too much of a good thing.  I would feel a bit better about this hoodie if it were $65 instead of $85.  The material is soft and comfortable but the chest pockets are so cheap and flimsy.\n\nI'm a woman but I do not like tight fitting clothing or things \"riding up\" as so often women's tops do so I opted for the men's version.  I couldn't remember if the last hoodie I ordered shrunk a bit so I got a larger size just in case.  The fit is very very loose and I hope that it does shrink after a few times in the wash.\n\nThe exterior pockets are really nice.  I can quickly tuck items away in the top pockets or put hand warmers in if I choose.  I photograph football games so I do expect to use them has handwarmer pockets.  The older hoodie had a springy key holder in it, which is now gone in favor of some bungy thing that i will not use.  The hidden pocket is really cool and I guess you could use it to tuck a cash or if you're a spy, an SD card in.  There are also thumbholes on the cuffs.  I've never really gotten the point of these but my friend squealed with pleasure when she realized they had them.\n\nThe interior chest pockets is where we get dicey.  They're made of a very thin nylon.  One of mine was torn when I received it in the mail.  I wanted to wear it immediately so I sewed it up myself rather than return it.  It was in doing so that I noticed that the pockets on this new version had gone from being well thought out compartments to just being big clumsy openings.  If you put a multitool in one of the pockets and move around as I do, it just tumbles around, eventually making it's way back to the deeper portion of the pocket.  In fact, anything that you put in that pocket will just slide around instead of staying in it's place and mostly ends up weighing the jacket down.  Another negative is that all of the pockets are pretty loose and open.  There are magnetic closures that are a nice feature but nothing I feel is really secure.  Maybe this is supposed to make it more\n\nThe one positive about the interior is that I am glad that they got rid of the plastic ID pocket, which I destroyed on the original after I put it in the dryer by accident.  Also, the weird personal area network flaps are gone in favor of small elastic loops.\n\nI've made some modifications by sewing sections into the interior pockets to this to make it work for me and the things I need to hold.  The SCOTTeVEST is a great idea, but I feel like Scott may need to do a few more revisions to make this perfect.", "summary": "Second SCOTTeVEST, second 'Meh' vote from me", "unixReviewTime": 1491004800}

This pair was one of two that I was pretty pleased with. I own a few real Black Milk leggings so I was curious to compare with these ones. Both in price and there are discontinued styles on Amazon. Here are few things to consider about THESE leggings.\n-Firstly these are XS-S size. I wear Black milk Large which according their website is Waist-89  Hip-114.5cm, from the description of these I should fit, right? Nope, not even close. So I gave them to my little sister who fits into them beautifully.\n-The print on them was the right one, but instead of looking like it was painted within thin stokes, it looks like it was a watercolor painting. With this print though it totally doesn't look funky. Like BM could have made them look like that and it would still sell. I think only someone who owns an authentic pair in this style would notice they are knockoffs.\n-The material is thick, not like BM's, but not see through if they fit well. Other people have said these leggings have broken, the pair I received was well stitched and besides the thinner fabric do not see them ripping any sooner then I would expect my Black Milk pairs to rip\n\nIf they were true to size and would fit me I would order tons of pairs from this retailer. I would recommend buying one just to see how they work for you. After all, they are knock-offs using the picture of the real thing so you can never be too sure what you will receive.

The middle zippered compartment slumps over regardless of what it inside and covers the contents of adjacent interior compartments\n- The main zipper requires two hands to close  (you have to hold an end with one hand and pull the zipper with the other)\n\nIn my opinion, the bag that I received is not worth the current price of $49.", "summary": "Cute bag, but not worth the money", "unixReviewTime": 1487980800}

If you're smaller than me I think they'll work great as well since they don't start out very big when unstretched.\n\nAlso,  while this is kind of random, I really liked the packaging these came in.

My son is 13 mo old and of average size (50%) for height. I ordered the size 12-18 mo, even after reading reviews that the shoes run large. My son started walking a month ago and the shoes are just too big for him to walk around in. I figured that we would want hard sole shoes by the time he could fit into these, so I am exchanging them for the smaller size, 6-12 mo. This first picture shows a 12 to 18 mo shoe on the left and a 6 to 12 mo show on the right. There is a 2 cm difference in length. Honestly, I think it would be perfect if they had a shoe size for in between these two. The smaller size does fit my son very well right now. The second picture shows this shoe and the Liam (which I also love). The difference in these shoes which are the same size (6-12mo )is about 1 cm.

I am hesitant to order jewelry on line because she has sensitivities. These came fast and in a nice EleQueen signed box with a pink velvety bag to store the earrings in. the earing set is a 4 piece all together as i see it. you can wear the whole thing as one pice or just the tow top tiny studs if you happen to have a backing for it. The stud part, which you can wear by its self or with the other part, is a beautiful round zirconia. what is Zirconia? well let me explain right quick. Cubic zirconia (CZ) is the cubic crystalline form of zirconium dioxide (ZrO2). The synthesized material is hard, optically flawless and usually colorless, but may be made in a variety of different colors. It should not be confused with zircon, which is a zirconium silicate (ZrSiO4). It is sometimes erroneously called \"cubic zirconium\".\n\nBecause of its low cost, durability, and close visual likeness to diamond, synthetic cubic zirconia has remained the most gemologically and economically important competitor for diamonds since commercial production began in 1976. Its main competitor as a synthetic gemstone is a more recently cultivated material, synthetic moissanite.\n\nAnd there is a silver hang down that goes behind the ear lobe on the post of the stud before the backing goes on. It drops down about half an inch. The drop down has a very large clear zirconia. I was worried, when I saw them, that they might be heavy but they are not. These would look great on a medium to tall person. Might be a little overwhelming on a small person.\nAt the end of the evening her ears were not red nor sore. There were many sales on beautiful earrings, and I wasn't really in the market for anything new, but these babies caught my eye right away. Now, I'm not typically a jewelry buy kind of a guy. Still, I love to buy my sisters and my wife a good pair of stud earrings and other jewelry. Like many folks, both my wife and my sisters love the dazzle of a gemstone, and though these are just standard CZ, these earrings are nothing but a Luxurious piece of art work.\nThese were a great buy.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/EleQueen-925-Sterling-Silver-Full-Cubic-Zirconia-Double-Round-Drop-Earrings-Bridal-Modern-Ear-Jacket-Clear/dp/B018I64TXG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">EleQueen 925 Sterling Silver Full Cubic Zirconia Double Round Drop Earrings Bridal Modern Ear Jacket Clear</a>", "summary": "Beautiful clear Zirconia", "unixReviewTime": 1466035200}

I am 5' 2\" and change, 128/129lbs, size 30I chest, and I have a short torso.  I bought the size 6. The straps are very well-made and extremely comfortable. The suit is well-made, sturdy and thick enough, it is intended to give a great silhouette, and I love the crossing pattern, but: I wish it hugged my body more from the sides, especially beneath the bust to lift the weight of the ladies. The chest area does not work, so much so that I don't feel comfortable posting a picture. The bodice portion has form to it, so if you are very large up top, the edges of those cups will press in. And you can't lift them up higher to account for that pressing because then you'd come out over the top of the cups.\nIf you have a full but not a very full chest (it is built for probably B,C,D cups; if that is you I think you should order) and have a torso that is a bit less trim than you might wish, then this suit will probably look great on you. If you are not (you are a moderate dress size but big chest, or you are super fit of any chest size, or you are flat chested) you should look for something else. If you are built like me: I bought the one-shoulder Jena OTS one-piece Maillot mesh suit from this same company (COCOSHIP), and that bathing suit could not flatter me more (I will go review it and post a picture). That one working so well is what made me buy this one with high hopes.

The color and quality are gorgeous and comparable to suits priced north of $60 - $70 in my opinion.  Unfortunately, my cup size (DDD) was too large for this suit, which I don't think could accommodate much more than a C cup or a barely D cup. With the exception of the cups, the 14 fit me well, my measurements are 44 bust, 39 waist, and 46 hip.  I'm 5'2\".  I found this suit to be a little short in the torso, so I don't think it would work for someone over 5'5\".\nThings I loved about this suit, the ruching in the front is a diagonal pattern which hid flaws well, but didn't overwhelm or make the suit too heavy.  The straps are padded which made them extremely comfortable, I kept trying to make my over-sized chest work for this because I loved the straps and cup shape so much, so HOT!\nThe one thing I disliked about this suit was the scooped back.  Scoop backs have never worked all that well for me because I always feel like the straps are about to fall off..  The color of this suit is absolutely gorgeous. I included a photo of the inside of the suit so you can see how well constructed it is.\nI can wholeheartedly recommend this suit if you're under 5'5\" and less than a D cup.\nI was in no way compensated for this review.", "summary": "So flattering!

I didn't want to have to spend a lot of a swimsuit because I don't want to wear the same size next year! This suit fits great and works with my cover up and is surprisingly great quality. I haven't taken it out to the pool for a test run, but I'm pretty amazed at how well it worked, especially since I was expecting it not to fit or work cause it's harder to shop for my top usually. The straps aren't adjustable which is why I ended up going a size down, because I wanted my top to feel support and it felt more roomy in the top in the 16.

It was giant before, and it's even more giant now that I am nursing. This bra is great and wonderfully comfortable.\n\nThis bra kind of reminds me of a bra that I have that's made by Bravado, except this one is much more affordable, literally half the price. This one is a very nice neutral beige color, and it has some extra stitching in the front so you have two separate bra cups so you don't get the \"sports bra uniboob\" going on with your figure.\n\nThe cups snap down individually, and they snap down all the way, there is no extra cloth that you have to pull out of the way to feed your baby. The snaps are secure, and you can snap them on and off with one hand easily. Which is definitely a good thing when you have a baby screaming and scratching at you to get at the milk! This bra is very well put together, the stitches are secure, and the cloth is a good quality.\n\nThis is a great bra, and I would definitely order it again.\n\nI hope that you found my review and pictures helpful.

After reading the reviews I decided on getting an XL instead of my usual size L in tops, and I'm glad I did. Fits the top area great, the rest of the shirt is boxy so it's not very fitted and looks a little strange if I were to wear it on its own. So, I'll only wear this with a cardigan or blazer. The material is pretty stiff, and wrinkles don't come out that easy when steaming or ironing. I know there are other color varieties on this shirt so maybe the material is different on the others, but the white is stiff.\n\nOverall, I do like it regardless of the odd fit and stiff material because I am choosing to wear it under something else. If you're thinking of doing the same I recommend this shirt.", "summary": "Cute collar, but stiff material", "unixReviewTime": 1476489600}

It's a dull matt finish which I kind of prefer than having something shinny.\nNow for the Cons:\nIt's not tapered in. Jacket is wider than expected. The length is also not as long as expected. The zipper is on the left which leaves me to believe this is a women's jacket but I don't know the standards in china. It's made in China. Though surprisingly pretty well for china. I bought a MEDIUM which I received but that translates to an XXL. Is this made for Oompa Loompas?\nAnd here's the worst part.\nFAKE POCKETS! Do not buy and support companies that make fake pockets. We're men. We need our pockets. The one interior pocket is real. But the two outside pockets are completely fake. That's false advertising.\nThis jacket has great potential but it simply falls flat in too many areas. The picture looks better than the product.

I wish it was the same as the skirt. It has a stiffness to it.\n I wear a 10, I ordered the xxl, which is the biggest size offered. The arm holes are fine, and I can't deal small openings, so that's a positive, I'm a 36 barely c, I wish it was a little roomier across the bust, but that part is wearable. The cap sleeves are another story, there is barely enough fabric to go across, so as long as my arms are down by my sides it's fine, but I can't raise them...at all. I love a fluttery cap sleeve, so these are beyond a disappointment. Ill try splitting them down the center, but most likely will have to remove them in order to salvage this dress.\n Aside from the hem, the stitching is good in the rest of this dress.\nAll things considered, a poor buy and a big disappointment.

I have more pairs of leggings that I know what to do with. These have by far been the most comfortable. The seams are pretty much non existent.

A lot of the other ones that I have say seamless but they really are not. These are very comfortable. The waist is stretchy and flexible. I don't feel like I'm going to pass out from the waist being super tight when I wear these. I am 5'2 and 115 lbs. These fit great! I still have wiggle room and am able to bend without the fear of ripping my pants. They are thick but not super thick. They are thick enough to not be see through. That is a plus. I do not need people to see what I am working with, you know? Got to keep a little to the imagination! You can wear these with just a regular casual top or dress it up and it will still look amazing. I am impressed with this legging because they hold up great. I washed them a few times and they still look great.

But I wanted to update this review to mention how helpful and accommodating the seller has been.  The seller, Jasgood, contacted me after my initial review and has been working very hard on finding a belt that fits my needs  (which is not an easy task), and wanting to make sure the information provided in their description is accurate . They have been fantastic.  So, while I stand by my review as far as the description being wrong on the size - I would have no problem recommending this seller & their products.  They have been truly fantastic.\n\nI rated these belts 2 stars because (on the positive side) 1- the price is very reasonable, 2- they are very stretchy, and 3- just because of the type a belt they are (where you can insert the prong anywhere along the fabric area) they are very flexible as far as size  BUT the stated size is very deceptive and misleading.\n\nI purchased a black & a navy of the skinny style.  The description says:  The skinny style . . . for pants size 26-32.  The relaxed length  tip-tip: black = 36 and the navy = 37.  Taking into consideration the 1 to the prong, this leaves 8 / 10 tails (for a 26 waist). So, while the belt can technically be worn  the excess belt wraps over  of the way around.\n\nI have a 26 waist which has forced me to look to kid belts.  I was hoping to wear these belts over tunic tops, which means I don't have belt loops to hold the excess tail in place.\n\nSince they are extremely stretchy  they could be worn for much larger than the 32 max on the description  but for the low side they are pretty much useless.", "summary": "UPDATE -", "unixReviewTime": 1495324800}

Both the band and the face look classy and elegant. The small crystals on the band are subtle they are not \"gaudy\". The watch has a stainless steel body. The band's maximum width 8\".\n\nThe package includes a tool to take out links out of the bracelet for a custom fit.  The tools works quite well. When you need to remove links look for arrows on the back of the bracelet, they show the direction in which the tool has to push.\n\nThe face of the watch is 1\" wide and the watch is 0.3\" thick. The watch is water resistant to rain and splashing but cannot be submerged into water.\n\nThis watch is made in China.  It include a manual which is in both English and Chinese and covers several Geya watches.  This watch only shows time, so it is very easy to set.\n\nOverall, this is a very attractive classy looking watch. It comes in attractive package, the box has a pillow and this presentation makes it suitable for being a present.\n\nThis watch was provided to me for review as part of a new product introduction. If you skeptical about my review because I received the clips at no cost I invite you to examine my reviews to see that I leave critical reviews when the products deserve it.\n\nAli Julia review", "summary": "Elegant watch", "unixReviewTime": 1473120000}

My wife and I were looking for a fun, updated and modern watch for her that would be a step up from her everyday watch.  We ran across this watch by Moog Paris.  She decided to give it a try.  When the watch was delivered, I signed for the delivery.  The watch arrived in a nicely packed box, all in tact.  The watch is a beautiful Skeleton watch, meaning that you are able to see all the movements working from the front and the back side of the watch.  When she put the watch on , the face of the watch was a little bit bigger on her wrist than she was used to but realizing the updated style of this watch , it certainly didn't take long for her to get used to it.  The Band is a VERY nice quality leather, and after wearing it a few times the leather has relaxed some and forms to her wrist like expected.\nIt took us about 3 weeks to review this watch.  I wanted to make sure it was keeping good time with the automatic self winding feature, and it does.  I have had no problems at all with the time being off.  It has been on the minute since the day I received it.  One other feature I noticed that wasn't advertised, is that the hands are glow in the dark.  I'm not sure how long they glow, when she goes to bed it glows and when she put it back on in the morning it is the normal hands, I do like that  feature. One of the many things I especially enjoy about this watch is getting lots and lots of complements.  I do a fair amount of reviewing , seldom giving 5 star review ratings.  Having that said , I am giving this watch a 5 star rating.  I love this watch.  In my opinion this Moog watch is everything that it was advertised to be.  I will and I already have recommended this watch to friends.\nI received this item either free or at a significant discount in exchange for agreeing to review this Moog watch with my HONEST and UNBIASED OPINION.  I did spend my own money on this watch and my review is my own.  It is the same review I would have given if I had paid full price for this product.", "summary": "My wife and I were looking for a fun, updated and modern watch for her that would ...", "unixReviewTime": 1464048000}

Aside from the plastic that covered each one of the bags.  I especially like the color, as I can most probably spot it at the carousel at claim baggage.  I also liked the double spinner wheels on each foot.  The bags are light, so the empty weight won't take too much away from the required 50 lbs.  I have not used them yet, as I haven't packed yet.  But I will know how sturdy they are when they are in company with other bags and how they withstand the stress of airport handling.  I may give another review after I traveled and back.  I a happy that I bought this compared to my old ones which are made of fabric entirely, but which have served me well over the years of traveling.  And I maintained and took care of them well even though they were not the greatest bags.  However, in recent years, I accidentally spilled hot chocolate which I bought and drank at the airport when I was hungry, and that stain barely went away despite the fact that I wiped it good with soap and water. With this polycarbonate shell, hopefully, I would not have to worry about spills.  The only thing I miss from the old one, is that they have outside pockets which are very helpful for keeping little things that one needs in an urgent situation.  This hardshell obviously do not have that, which is negligible.  I would recommend this product for the qualities it has.", "summary": "I especially like the color", "unixReviewTime": 1492992000}

I needed a gown for a gala, but everything I found looked like a prom dress. You could def wear this to the prom but it's more tasteful and mature. I'm not about to spend hundreds on dresses this season, and have found some beautiful dresses on Amazon. (Surprisingly!) I'm usually not afraid to order Bc almost everything is free returns, so if I don't like it, I send it back.  I ordered 3 dresses for 2 galas, not realizing that the returns are not made to amazon, but directly to the company overseas (not free!).  I received the first one, and I was so disappointed. It didn't look outright cheap but it didn't look elegant. Returning anything to China is $60. So I was starting to get nervous I had thrown $130 x3 down the drain (different companies). I think one of the major differences though is that w this dress, I gave exact measurements. I'm a 34DD, a size 2, and short (5'1\"), so dresses don't naturally fit me well. So perhaps some of the disappointment in the last dress was in the overload of material that made it look too princessy. Which is great for an 18y! But I'm a physician and don't think I can get away w the princess look anymore! Anyhow, I was super concerned that the top would not fully cover my breasts- that it would do that thing where it hangs off your breasts, and you don't see anything from the front, but they're totally exposed underneath. So i not only followed their instructions in measurements, but I measured from my clavicle to over my breast, and down about an inch. Don't know if this made a difference. I also sent a picture of myself-belly up, so they could see how I wanted it to fit.  Of course, I never thought they'd actually follow it; people usually do their own thing. Kind of like when you bring a picture to the salon and you leave w thick choppy highlights anyway. So I couldn't believe how right they got the fit! So if you want the dress to fit a certain way, you can def tell them, but be detailed so they have something to work off of. I didn't want too much skin exposed. It's not for my body type. But if I was skinny w a smaller bust, or going to prom, I'd prob want the dress to show a little more skin. Anyhow, it's not hard, they want like four basic measurements- bust, waist, hip, height (don't forget to include heel height)! Now, if you have any additional requests, then include that info too. If you're a young skinny girl, I suspect the basic measurements are enough!\n\nFurthermore, I needed the dress for 5/4, and amazon said 4/29-5/11. So before buying, I contacted them, and asked if a 5/2 date was possible? They said yes, no extra charge or anything. Actually got it on 4/27. I really couldn't be happier. A dress like this in a couture store would be hundreds. The quality is so good. I'm in shock. The beading is remarkable. A lot of these dresses from overseas come wrinkled and you basically get what you pay for, but this is actually an amazing dress!!\n\nAs you can see the quality is excellent, and that's just me trying it on right out of the bag (don't expect fancy packaging- but it looks that good even though it's been folded for who knows how long, cheap dresses would have permanent indentations). I will try to post pictures after the event- w better lighting and shoes, this picture doesn't do it justice. But I put it up, Bc I know it's gala and prom season and I'm sure people are wondering if they should take a chance. So, since I did, here are a couple of pics. Sorry for my dirty mirror!!\n\nMY BEST ADVICE- if you like this dress and you can see for yourself it's good quality- send your measurements!!!! Remember, their sizes are different than ours and you will more than likely be disappointed guessing your size, and it's annoying to return. This is actually a great deal. Any other dress in a store, I would have had to pay $50 hemming (for sure Bc I'm so petite), and depending on the dress, I usually have to buy a significantly bigger size to fit my bust and then have it let in, so the alterations alone can be $100. The only way you will be happy is if you make it to your personal size. it saves time in the long run Bc you won't have to go to a seamstress.", "summary": "Stunning!", "unixReviewTime": 1461974400}

Well, they didn't. They were MUCH too small for me. Plus, there's little-to-no give to the material at all. And so, we all know where this goes, yeah? They cut into the flesh, leaving awkward bulges and deep marks once I got them off. And please, let's not get started on the panty-lines those awkward bulges made underneath a thick pair of denim shorts. They're also - for lack of a better way to describe it - made... shallowly? Like the front and back are both super low-rise, hitting just above the pubic bone in the front and barely above the pertinent back area. It was a travesty because the design is so gosh darn cute.\n\nI imagine they'd probably fit a size 0-1 that's a couple inches shorter than me, though... I'll recommend them to those of you out there fitting that description, if you're out there and considering purchase. Because not only are they cute, the bow's unobtrusive and material pretty comfortable.\n\nOnce last note: the description is currently (09/09/2016) referencing this item as \"Sexy, Playful and Comfortable Open Crotch\" - they're not open crotch. Which I was personally glad about, because I got them for a photo shoot based on the product images (which implied a solid panel on some of the other color options).", "summary": "\"What is this?

Love the size, flat design, and durability. The included carabiner inside for linking keys onto is a nice touch and overall this is very lightweight.\n\nI've had this belt for over four months and it's holding up nicely. Personally, I'd prefer it if the inside (netted side) wasn't a light, creamy shade, because it rubs against jeans or clothes and easily stains. It is, however, true to color as pictured and without the bulge of a fanny pack..\n\nIt has a modern look and I think this would make a good gift for anyone who travels. The pockets are perfect for different sized items and are not lacking for the minimalist who wants to carry a couple cards, cash, phone, keys, and a passport. Under a loose t-shirt this can be done so inconspicuously.\n\nIt has an adjustable strap to go around the waist that seems well made and is designed similarly to a luggage strap. The fit is wide enough to be supportive while a nice, comfortable fit. For reference, my hips are 38\" and I can wear this comfortably with room to spare.\n\nRFID protection is a nice added feature that gives me peace of mind. This would also have good use for while laying by the pool. Because it's nylon, lies flat, and could easily wipe clean, it could lie under a beach towel to carry the few necessary items while staying at a hotel.\n\nFor currently under $13, I think this is a good value and I'd recommend it to others.

I am 5' 6\" and weigh about 170 lbs. and I'm big busted; a 42 DD, so I bought the 2XL. The sizing is a little bit forgiving, too, since you can loosen up the ties in the back. I found the front clasps to be a little clumsy and hard to get clasped together but once I got them all clasped I just pulled the ties tight in the back and then the magic happened. Tummy got sucked in which is what I wanted since I've had 6 babies and the girls got lifted back to where they should rightfully sit, haha.

I really like it when I am going to the farmers market or a sports game. I do not want to put my purse on the dirty arena floor, so I just use the attached wristlet and keep it close to me. It also comes with a stylus pen that actually works.\nAs you can see in my pictures I got the pink one. The purse itself is a nice soft subtle pink.  The material feels like leather, but I do not believe it is.  The zipper is strong and I have had no issues with that at all.\nYour phone is tightly secured inside of the zippered pouch, so you really have everything you need.\nI have resourcefully put everything in this wallet and keep it in my purse.  When I want to just run into the store I just pull this out so I am not toting the big bulky purse around.  So far I have been using this for over 30 days and it has held up well.  There are no scratches on it, zipper continues to work, no tears in the material or thread coming unraveled.\nDisclaimer  I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are of my own and not influenced in any way by anyone or the discount I received. I do not give out 5 stars unless the product meets my qualifications and standards and this one does.\n1. It is not overpriced\n2. Workmanship\n3. In this case the number of slots for my cards\n4.

I will probably sew it together, since the other part wraps around and ties as well.\nThe bottoms are typical string bikini bottoms. Nothing special, nothing wrong with them. Always a good choice because you can tie them to fit your needs. The tush is cut narrow, which fits the bill as this is a sexy bikini.", "summary": "Not bad", "unixReviewTime": 1460332800}

After looking online, I decided to give this bow tie set a try, since the price was good. This set includes five pre-tied bow ties in different colors and patterns.  My son's particularly like the two polka dot ties, and the blue and red striped ties.  The brown and black ties are a little boring in my opinion, but may look good in a formal situation like a wedding or funeral.  What I love best about these ties is how easy they are to put on and off.  Also, they are adjustable, so they can fit my boys of different ages.  The material looks great, and they are made well.  For the price, I think these are a great deal!  My sons are loving these bow ties, and I love how cute they look!  I would definitely order from this company again.  These ties would fit toddlers, (probably babies too) up until about age eight or nine.  Then they would need a larger size of bow ties.  I did receive this product at a discount for an honest evaluation.  Our set shipped quickly, are made well, and free of defects or problems, so I highly recommend them!", "summary": "Great set, Great price!!", "unixReviewTime": 1456876800}

I love each one of the bow ties, they are really nice patterns and colors. I bought them for my two young boys and they look adorable one. I enjoy that they are pre-tied (as I have no clue how to tie a tie) and that you simply clip the back. The band is adjustable so it can fit any neck, which means they fit both of my boys.

He hates wearing ties of any sort, but was excited about these. This set comes with a great selection of colors and designs. The bow ties are all made of nice thick quality fabric and are well made. Each bow tie is pre-tied and attached to an adjustable elastic strap that will easily accommodate varying neck sizes. There is a plastic clasp on each end of the elastic band, that hook together and lock into place. What a great way to look sharp in just seconds! These prints will go perfectly with my little guy's navy blue suit. I love that his look will now look more versatile on Sundays. Plus, we have a black bow tie for more formal affairs. So grateful for the simplicity of these bow ties. No worrying about trying to get ties tied as we are rushing out the door to church. My little man can put these on himself! Plus, he will not have to worry about them being to tight and uncomfortable, as they can be adjusted to what he feels happy with. Win-win for us!\n\nDisclaimer: I received a discount on these items in exchange for my fair and honest review.

These were perfect for the weather we encountered.\nI gave them four stars because of their low cost.  (If they had cost much more, they would have been a 3 star purchase at best.). However, they are very thin, certainly not winter weight.  My husband really disliked the fact that they did not have a fly.

Anyways I went with the XL because of the reviews and it's just a little to high up on the bottom and the top fits well other then the enormous padding for the chest are. I'm not sure if we would have been able to get away with the next size down though. So I have cut the padding out of the top and am making a few alterations to the top to make it something my 13 year old daughter can wear. Now the swim suit itself is made very nicely and I think it's nice enough to bother altering it and am happy with the overall quality. The shipping however was pretty awful but that was amazons fault and I'm not going to penalize the seller for something completely out of their hands,especially since they responded very quickly and were easy to deal with. I would recommend this but would only order one size up at the most if I were you. I was lucky enough to get a discounted price to try this item out and let people know how it worked out for me. In no way am I obligated to rate one way or another. I rate in relevance to how the product does or does not suit me and my needs.

Its a beautiful bathing suit, I guess it just really doesn't work for my body type. I am 5'2 and 150 lbs. I have a 34c chest and I wear a size 4-6 in bottoms (depending where on the store). I think I am just too short for a high waisted bikini, so it just doesn't flatter my body type very well. I ordered a large where I typically wear a medium in everything else, the top fits perfectly (as I mentioned I am a 34c) but the bottoms are a little snug. Depending on the size of your chest and your thighs, I highly recommend sizing up 1-2 sizes depending how you like your things to fit. The large is even boarder line too small for the bottoms. Another thing I want to comment on, the top is basically like wearing a bra. The design of the top itself,  and the way the pads are situated, it is like wearing a push up bra. If you are uncomfortable with the thought of walking around in a bra (that is basically what this top reminds me of doing) than this style bathing suit may not be for you. I think I am going to keep the suit just for the top, because I personally do like the fit and style of it, but there is no way I can wear the bottoms. They just fit me weird and the bottoms just look funny on me. I gave the product three stars just because I find their sizing weird. It is weird and annoying to me to have to go up a size or even two sizes from your typical size, and in my case, I wouldn't be able to go up a size for the bottoms because you have to order the two pieces together and the xl top would be way too big.

Always skeptical about sizing, I ordered a 3XL based on the product measurement table. I am currently around a size 14, I always have issues with tops and bottoms of two piece swim suits being slightly off, usually with the top being just right and the bottoms being being too big, however, while this fits pretty close to perfect, the top fit slightly bigger than the bottom fit. Still my biggest concern was the suit coming up too high and cinching/creating a weird fat roll or something. Lucky for me, it goes up just above my navel and to my natural waist and gives a nice silhouette. That being said the material might be a little thin for some (might feel a bit cheap) if you're looking for a lot of support on the bottoms (particularly smoothing out the lower tummy) you probably won't get that entirely, but the pattern and style do help detract if you're seeking a sleeker look. For me, a 36D, I felt the top part was adequately supportive and comfortable!

I was expecting just a couple inches longer, but my butt has gotten bigger too, so that could be part of the reason. The sleeves do not hit the full length to be considered long sleeves, but I woul dhave just pushed them up anyways, mostly because that is what happens to any long sleeve I wear. The neck line is fantastic. It does not show any cleavage at all; I would have been fine either way, but just as a reference for this one. The scoop neck in the back does go lower than the front in my case, but not too low where my bra is exposed. The slit/ extra layer at the bottom gives it just enough of a cute/ fashion edge to ensure that this is not just a regular dress.

Problem is, t-shirts of video games of the Nintendo 64/Playstation/Sega Dreamcast generation typically don't have large-scale production (hopefully this will change in the coming years). With the release of the game on the 3DS, however, merchandise like this t-shirt came out, and I was excited to pick this up at my local Hot Topic.\n\nThe design is simple, but really effective. The bright colors of Majora's Mask really pop in comparison to the black background, and that wide-eyed gaze of the mask is definitely haunting. It's pretty form-fitting, so buy a size up if you're looking for something more loose (I'm 5'10 and weigh 175 lbs and bought my actual shirt size at \"medium\", so I attached a photo to this review for some reference). The mask graphic and game logo both haven't shown any signs of wear after several washings, so it's a pretty durable shirt. It's fairly soft, too, so it just feels good to wear!\n\nI've been waiting a while for a t-shirt like this to come out, and I was definitely not disappointed. It looks good, it feels good, and it'll definitely get you compliments from fellow gamers. I'd highly recommend getting it while Majora's Mask merch is out right now, and it's a great choice of apparel for Zelda fans of all ages.

I would add a zipper at the top of the card slot areas for double security and, 2. I would attach an eyeglass pocket to the outside back.  But the magnets that hold the flap in place are very strong so my concern about possibly losing credit cards has not been an issue.

Small may be a misleading word, however. By small I mean it's not a bulky bag but in terms of volume, it is impressively large on the inside. There are multiple pockets, both zippered and not, on the outside and inside; storing a bunch of things in this is easy and it can accommodate a lot. There is one zipper on the top of the flap that covers the inside which goes down the length of the clutch when opened. It is an enormous pocket in terms of length, depth and width. It is the entire size of the clutch. There's another, smaller zippered pocket on the backside which is about half the size of the clutch which can hold quite a bit of stuff as well. The top flap of the clutch is held down via magnets so it's not free to open without some force. They're not incredibly strong magnets but sufficient for the purpose to prevent the flap from opening easily. Once the flap is opened, there is a zippered pocket on the outside that is half the size of the clutch much like the pocket on the backside. Next to that zippered pocket is an open flap that has six individually lined slots for credit cards and/or ID cards. That flap is also the size of half the clutch so there's room for other items like cash, not just the credit cards. Next to that flap is another open flap that has six more individually lined slots for credit cards, a deep pocket, and a zipper lined interior pocket for holding those more important things. Like I said, there are many pockets to hold multiple things simultaneously. It's a lot bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside.\nSo now moving onto the build quality. This clutch is actually really well made. The leather appears and feels to be of higher grade. It is scratch resistant as the product site claims and is thicker than you might expect. It's not at all flimsy, thin, or cheap feeling. The walls are sturdy and it has some weight to it; it's not overly heavy but it's not the lightest either which, in my opinion, is indicative of its quality. The zippers, too, are all of higher quality. They open and close with ease and do so flawlessly. All the metal: the zipper, its handles, and the side clips for the shoulder strap is coated to provide a smooth and silky surface. The zippers all have nicely designed matching handles. The coating is a nice touch and add to both the appearance and function of the bag. These may seem to be minor details but they've been adequately addressed by the company so as to provide a quality product. That leads me to the lining on the inside of the bag. The entire bag and all their pockets have individually lined interiors. The lining has a silky smooth texture and a nice, attractive design. I really like the material that's been used on the inside; it looks beautiful and feels great. It's not a felt interior so things won't get caught on it. Moreover, as I said before, the pockets are individually lined as are the credit card slots so everything is compartmentalized which makes organizing everything into their spots that much easier. Lastly, the stitching is excellent. The entire bag is stitched properly and efficiently so that it doesn't fall apart after just one use. It is also the same stitching and design around the entire bag inside and out for continuity which makes its appearance that much more elegant.\nThe bag also comes with two straps. It has one shoulder strap which brings the bag down to about waist level and another strap meant for wrists if you prefer a clutch like feel. I, personally, use the wrist strap over the shoulder since this makes a truly elegant clutch. I did get the \"red\" version but it's more of a pink/red mix rather than a traditional red color.

Each card is separated from each other.\n-thick leather ensures this won't fall apart easily and reinforced the high quality feel of the bag\n-really well packaged\n\nThis is one of the best clutches I've ever owned at this price point. Not only does it accommodate all my daily things but it can hold a lot more than I was anticipating. It's appearance can be deceiving in that respect. The interior lining is both lovely and functionally superior to other materials. The bag looks and feels great. Overall, it's not cheaply made nor does it feel that way. I love the way it was packaged, as well. It came packaged between cardboard flaps, in a microfiber like bag which was placed in a plastic bag which was then in a larger plastic container. All that packaging ensures that it arrives in flawless condition as mine did. Excellent in every way.\nI did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. The company did not compensate me and discounted merchandise does not ensure a positive review. My views and opinions are completely my own, honest and unbiased in every way. I provide the most extensive and accurate account of my experiences so that you can make a better decision. I have included some pictures of the bag I received and the various pockets it has.", "summary": "Remarkably well made and incredibly versatile", "unixReviewTime": 1460419200}

It has more pockets than anyone could ever use, is built very well, and looks stylish.\n\nA woman's purse is often about style, and this one has it done right. I got the \"rose\" color, and it looks a lot better than the product page, more of a deep pink than rose in my opinion.\n\nThere are a number of things that stand out.\n\n+ Construction. The leather is thick and  strong; you can tell it is genuine. A dual set of hidden magnets keeps it closed securely, but allows for easy opening as well. Construction is single stitching, but the stitching is close together and very well done. The zippers are a darkened metal that work really well against the rose color. The shoulder strap is somewhat thin - this isn't designed for heavy weights - but ties in well to the design.\n\n+ Storage. You might have to call \"Indiana Jones\" to find stuff in this purse. It has a main zipper, an inner zipper inside the main flap, a large zipper on the outside flap that can hold full size sheets (folded over, of course), and an external zippered compartment. In total, six places to put stuff, in addition to six slots for credit cards, conveniently accessible once the main pouch is opened.\n\n+ Style. It just looks really sharp, with a triple fold when closed and those darkened metal zippers. You will look good with this one.\n\nThere is one thing to consider when contemplating purchase. This is a \"business casual\" purse, not meant for formal or evening use. It is great for all around wear, due to the sturdy leather, and it will look good wherever you go, but it would be a bit out of place in a formal environment.\n\nSummary: A great general purpose purse to carry lots of stuff in style. Highly recommended.\n\nPlease note that I received this free of charge, so I could review it.", "summary": "Stylish For Business Or Casual Wear, With Lots of Storage", "unixReviewTime": 1459468800}

I've actually had it for almost 3 years now, and the reason I'm just now writing a review is because after 3 years of HARD use, and honestly probably over filling it a bit, the portion that holds the metal loop to the bag so that you can attach your strap broke. However, I'm still giving this 5 stars because I am genuinely hard on my purses and this little thing has performed beyond expectations. The leather is beautiful and has held up extremely well, just some minor issues with zippers starting to wear out and now the stitching coming loose so that the loop fell off, but what can you expect from daily use for nearly 3 years?! I only wish this bag came in more colors, because honestly I am ready to change it up, but I will miss all of the space and the fact that I could carry a million lipsticks, my phone, a pack of gum, and all of my credit cards with total ease and great organization.

I had tried to put in insoles, but that just made the boots tighter on the feet and I could not put them on.\nConclusion: It's tough to find shoes/boots that fit properly online. I would suggest getting feet measured so you know exactly what you wear. I have now done this and found that these boots, had I done it previously, would not have worked for me.\nSpecs: Synthetic, Man made sole. Shaft measures approximately 8 from arch.

When the Kailee waterproof backpack arrived, I was so happy to see the beautiful pink color to begin with. For that in itself, I give the bag high regards. Then, when I started taking it out of the tiny bag it was in, I realized that the little bag was actually a pocket on the backpack itself! It then has a velcro-type of closure. The backpack also has two mesh outside pockets that you can put your water bottle and phone in, so you don't have to open the bag to get to your phone. There's a divider in the main part of the bag, but no inside zippers or pockets.\n\nThis bag is awesome to travel with. Pull it out of your purse and you have another carry on, or you have something to put all your goods in when you are at flea markets. Definitely an awesome extra bag to have when traveling. This serves its purpose very well. The bag is water resistant, but not water proof. It does a great job of repelling water and keeping items dry inside.\n\nThe shoulder straps fit well, and the backpack was easy to carry. It's very very lightweight - I checked and it does weigh a little over 5 ounces so if you are like me and your suitcase pushes the weight limits imposed by the airlines, this backpack won't push you over the limit!! The longest part of this bag is 17 inches so you can fit plenty in it!\n\nI could even see using this bag to take to out of town running events, since there's plenty of room to pack everything and I can feel safe knowing it'll stay dry too! I received this product without cost in exchange for my honest review. Thanks so much! Great job Kailee!", "summary": "I can use this bag for out of town running events since there's plenty of room!", "unixReviewTime": 1453852800}

I wear a lot of pink so this will go great with my wardrobe.\n\nI also like the fact that it is lightweight so its perfect to take on quick trips to the gym or store.  And because its so lightweight, it folds up into a nice neat little package for easy storage.  I can just throw it in another bag when not in use!\n\nIt has two mesh pockets, one on either side which are great for water bottles and other small items.  There are also two smaller zipper compartments on the front.  One large main compartment is perfect for books, clothes, or bigger items you may need to carry with you.\n\nThere is definitely plenty of room and plenty of separation with this bag.

The amazon pictures make it appear that the bag is pretty decent sized and may appear comparable to a usual targus or swiss gear bag but it is not. I am not trying to say this is a con of this product, I am saying this so you set your expectations before you hit the Add to cart. This is the primary reason I am showing a picture of this product with the swiss gear bag I have that I take to work daily. These swiss gears are full size bags which can even accommodate 17 laptops.\n\nThe first thing you would notice when you receive this bag is that it would not look like a bag at all. It comes in a very very compact packaging with just a string on top of that. You would in no way guess there is a back inside it. Once you open the packaging which is fastened using a velcro. The actual bag which is like super folded will have to be unfold the entire thing to reveal the actual bag. The shoulder straps on this are not joined when you get it for first time, I choose the black and red color and I don't remember what the listing said before, but when I received the bag, it was orangy color actually. I don't mind, just letting you all know.\n\nSo first thing you do is that you attach both the ends of the shoulder straps so the thing becomes usable.\n\nTouching the bag, you will know that it is indeed waterproof and is of plasticky material. It is not actually thick so do know that. I see one of the amazon pictures putting laptop inside it. Now with such a kind of bag, I would personally be reluctant to put one in my bag. I am not saying that the bag is flimsy, just that I am reluctant to put something relatively heavy like a laptop, not because it will tear the bag and fall, but lest I drop the bag, the laptop would not have any cushioning and can get damaged, i prefer my swiss gear for this.\n\nThe bag has 2 side slot for keeping bottles. The shoulder strap which actually touches your shoulders do not have any padding as such and this is expected due to the extremely slim profile and foldability of this bag. The picture you see with bag full has an iPad Air 2 (with a bulky otterbox type cover), a soft toy, Gopro accessories set and a box of humidifier unit.  The bag did hold everything well.\n\nMy personal uses of this bag as I see it are, using to hold few gym items like small towel and other stuff. Another usage I want to put this in, is to have it for keeping my kids travel food and such. With it being waterproof inside out, if something spills inside, I don't expect it to ruin other things outside. When not used, you can fold the bag back in its pack but it can be little tricky because you may not be able to fold it as good as it came with. But I did somehow manage to do the best I could, check the last picture to see that.\n\nThe bag is best for small uses and putting light weight stuff and preferably no electronics. The title says camping but honestly it is not really for camping purpose, it would not hold so much and is not really that padded and not really heavy duty like swiss gear bags. But definitely good for other uses mentioned.\n\n*I received this product as a part of promotion in exchange of a honest and unbiased feedback based upon my usage of the product.", "summary": "Great for short uses and light weight stuff, waterproof, not heavy duty and not for camping or hiking", "unixReviewTime": 1453507200}

It is about 16 inches high by 10 inches wide. It's a casual backpack to take to the gym or beach. It's not that rugged - not the kind you'd take out hiking and camping in the wilderness. The material is lightweight and thin without a liner. The shoulder straps width is nice at almost 2-1/2 inches but they are not very cushiony.\n\nI was also a little disappointed as it's not exactly the same one I ordered. The one I ordered was a solid gray and had no branding. With that said, the style is the same (just different color designs). I like the black but I don't like the branding. It says kailee on the front of it in bright red letters almost 8 inches long. On the smaller pouch, it says the same but in bright white letters. There are also some strange looking floral hand prints and the word, sport. This all makes it look kind of busy.\n\nPros: I do like how it comes in the built-in storage pouch. The pouch that holds it is about 7-1/2 inches by 5 inches. Once you expand it out it just becomes part of the backpack. It's also easy to put back in within a minute. It also has a loop to hang it. And as mentioned earlier, it's very lightweight. It has two netted pockets about 6-1/2 inches by 5-1/2 inches that are great for holding water bottles. Inside, you've got two large compartments that will hold a lot of stuff. It's also water resistant. Great for when you have to carry things on the go and it can easily store away when not in use.

The initial size is about the size of a softball and the entire package doesn't weigh any more than a couple of ounces.\n\nRecommended uses would be a student athlete going out of town or to a practice game to take a change of clothing and some shower supplies, taking clothes to the gym, or as a really nice backpack for a bike ride.  However, I see no way to justify calling this a camping backpack.  It is just way too small and light duty.\n\nThe top of the bag is pretty small and you wouldn't be able to fit anything more than a junior size soccer ball through the opening.  There are two partitions inside, but not well defined.  The top zippers shut well and easily, but it is not a heavy duty zipper.  There are two outside netted pockets, but neither are very deep and while they would not adequately hold a sports water bottle, they probably would hold a typical throwaway bottle just fine.  The top elastic on these pockets isn't very strong but it is adequate to put a little pressure on the contents.  I see these pockets as ideal for holding a hand towel or something light.  The shoulder straps are pretty light duty.  There is a small amount of padding on the shoulders but overall, these are probably fitted properly to the size and weight capacity of the bag itself, which I wouldn't want to carry any more than about 5 pounds.  The lower straps are pretty narrow and low duty as well, basically there to connect top and bottom, not to provide much stability.\n\nI also tested the water resistance of the bag and it passed all tests, however I would call this a water resistant bag, not a waterproof bag since it has basic cloth zippers.\n\nOverall, it's an okay bag for some uses, but it is way oversold by calling it a camping backpack and calling it waterproof.  It is neither and these and the overall build are the reasons for reducing stars.\n\nI was provided with a free sample product for evaluation and to provide a fair and honest review.", "summary": "Okay backpack when you don't have much to carry", "unixReviewTime": 1452902400}

At first, I didn't know if you are supposed to untie the knot to put the bracelet on but later realized that the string is adjustable by simply pulling one or the other to either tighten or loosen it. I love that it is adjustable because I like mine a little snug around the wrist.

Neither one of us could believe it. She has been wearing it every day and it hasn't tarnished at all. She gets so many compliments on it. This has to be one of the best gifts I have ever given her.

Its made of 95% Rayon and 5% Spandex so it is really stretchy and soft. I wear a size 10-12 and this shirt fits amazing on me. As a mother of 5 kids my body is not what it used to be. With this shirt I can look nice and cover up some of those flaws. The scrunch at the bottom makes hiding my love handles easy. I love that it is loose on top and works it way into more fitting on the bottom. It can be worn all year around with the light weight breathable material. It can be dressed up with a skirt or slacks it also looks good with blue jeans. I feel every confident in this shirt, and when I feel good about my clothes I tend to have better days. I was concerned that it would ride up that has not been the case at all. It stays nicely around my hips, and the scrunches will stay the way I adjusted them too. Overall this is a stylish shirt that would look good on thin or larger women, it can work for work, nights out with the girls, or casual wear, soft breathable fabric that doesn't shrink when washed and dried, can be worn all seasons, and comfortable. I highly recommend this shirt.\n\nI received Free to Live Women's Short Sleeve Dolman Top size XL at a discount or for free for my honest and unbiased review.

I plan to surprise her next time we go out camping as I know as the sun goes down I'll be able to keep track of her around the campsite. These are great little novelty items and the ability for them to change colors and patterns make them extra fun for her. She squealed in delight when I handed them to her and said \"Thanks mom! These are awesome!\"\n\nMy original order came as all one single color of green and not multicolor. The seller was contacted immediately and quickly sent out a replacement which had the correct multicolored lights.\n\nThere are a few things that I feel could use improvement for this product.  1) There is no way to change out the batteries when they burn out. 2) Things are just kind of glued together and so I did have one where the fiber optic strands came out entirely because the glue did not hold correctly. But a quick hot glue gun repair on my own and it was good as new! This only happened to one of my six I received. 3) The barrette style that it uses might be difficult with thick hair in order to get it to clip (See video). Overall it's a nice fun product and I'm still very happy with it.\nI received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Great colors and good for camping or going out at night", "unixReviewTime": 1462924800}

The colors are very nice, the blue is a shade or two darker than pictured but looks better in a darker shade with the blue and white. I did go ahead and order and XL based on the previous reviews. I normally wear a large at 180lbs. and the XL was a perfect fit, a size large would not have fit in the back/shoulders and arms would have been too short and I'm 5'11\" so keep the sizing in mind and order a size up.\n\nThe material was much different then expected but I was pleasantly surprised. The material is almost like a dry-fit texture, very cool and lightweight so would be good for warmer weather to keep cool. It loos like it would handle spills and be easy to clean. The material is labeled as being 75% cotton, 22 % polyester and 3% spandex and feels very strong and durable. The spandex gives it just a little bit of give, which is comfortable and nice. I will definetly not put this in the dryer and use a low temp iron as the tag noted to keep below 120 degrees. I believe this shirt will hang dry very quickly and well due to the material. The only minor downside was it does look like it will need to be ironed after washing as it did come slightly wrinkled in the back area.\n\nI have attached a picture as they say is worth a thousand words. As mentioned, I love the color, material and the fit runs slim fit as advertised so order one size up. I like to roll my sleeves up and the solid blue also gives the shirt a nice contrast when you roll the sleeves up because the rest of the shirt is striped. The buttons are heavy-duty, I buttoned and un buttoned the shirt several times and noticed that the stitching is very good compared to some other shirts that only have a string of thread holding the buttons on and they fall off after a couple of uses.\n\nI received this shirt at discount for trying and providing an honest review. This shirt is actually high quality and lines up with any other shirt that I have paid $30 for so I believe it is a great value and great quality.

It feels very synthetic.\n\nAs for the fit, I am normally a medium, so I ordered an extra size up to a large. It fits like a regular fit, except that it's very long and must be worn tucked in.\n\nHere are my pros and cons:\n\nPROS:\n-- Nice color! Nice feeling collar and pattern\n-- Light material because 25% polyester/spandex\n-- Fits regular if you get a size up\n\nCONS\n-- Feels very synthetic\n-- Hand wash only!!! This is important, as it doesn't say this on the shirt itself\n-- This wrinkles VERY easily, which is a pain. I thought that since it was 25% polyester/spandex, it wouldn't wrinkle so easily.\n\nDISCLAIMER: I received this product at a discount in exchange for a review.", "summary": "Note that this is only 75% cotton, 25% polyester/spandex.", "unixReviewTime": 1461110400}

On the other hand it is very large and heavy.  I can see an elderly socialite (for some reason Joan Collins comes to mind) wearing it, but when I put it on I was uncomfortable wearing it.  Maybe if I wore a ball gown at the same time...\n\nThis watch is more of bracelet than a time keeping piece.  It feels well made.  It came with no documentation and it really does not need it other than figuring out how to open the clip.  It has a clip closure which is possible (even though a little awkward) to open with one hand.\n\nThe watch's face and bracelet are the  same width 1 3/4\".  The length of the dial is 1 11/16\".  The bracelet length is 7.5\"\n\nThe back says that it is made out of stainless steel and that it is water resistant.\n\nThe watch comes in a nice box with a pillow.  However the box is taped closed when you remove the tape it pulls on the box finish and destroyed it.  If you getting this watch as a gift be careful.\n\nThis watch is provided for evaluation and review. Getting a review product does not influence what I say, I always describe pluses and minuses from my experience. Bottom line that it is a bit over-sized for me, but feels well made.\n\nAli Julia review", "summary": "A bit over-sized for me", "unixReviewTime": 1468800000}

My son will get a lot of use out of it.  Here are some additional thoughts on it:\n\n* It runs approximately 1 size small.  I would definitely suggest sizing up.  If it's too big to start with, it will fit eventually.\n* The top is more t-shirt than sweatshirt material -- I expected it to be like a sweatshirt, but it is thing.  That's fine as it's fairly warm where we live, but good to know before you buy.  The quality of the screenprint on the top is good and it doesn't appear that it will crack / show significant wear quickly.  The top is surprisingly soft. I cold washed it and hung it to try and it's still quite soft.\n* The jeans have an applique fire truck. It matches nicely with what's on the top.  The draw string is functional which helps if you have a skinny child like mine.  Again, the quality seems quite good.\n\nOverall, I'm very pleased. If you are looking for an outfit at this price point this is definitely a good option.\n\nPicture shows 48in/43lb in sz7, was hoping would fit next winter and I think it will be perfect!\n\nDisclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review of the product.

The product picture does the actual gown no justice at all!

The beading in the bodice and the appliques on the skirt are absolutely beautiful and well placed.\n\nAnd the customer service is superb; they were prompt with their responses and very attentive to requested alterations. Considering this is a wedding dress with an extensive train, I requested that they shorten the hem of the dress and the cape veil significantly as I was purchasing it for my sister's sweet sixteen. We gave them her measurements, requested the shortened train, and when the dress arrived it was absolute perfection: the train was the perfect length and the bodice fit like a glove!\n\nJust one thing of note, the corset lacing in the back of the bodice is not purely ornamental, it is functional. That is to say, there are no hooks or zippers to completely bring both sides of the bodice together, the corset lacing is the only way to tighten the bodice. But as long as your measurements are correct, the lacing will make the dress very snug!\n\nI would recommend this gown and this seller very highly!

I took the chance and ordered the dress, they emailed me about my measurements and I sent mine to them. When the dress came in I was so nervous I left it on the counter for almost an hour lol. I finally tried the dress on and it was AMAZING! BEAUTIFUL!  It fit great! I cannot wait to wear it in my wedding!

I first purchased a large Bc a lot of the reviews said to get your shirt size well it was wayyyyy too small my best friend wears an extra small shirt & I let her have the large that I ordered it even fit her tight & she's is not big at all she is literally skin & bones! (5'2 109lbs) so I ordered a 2x this time & still a no go. I can get it on & it fits tight as it's supposed to but it's way to short it comes no where near covering my whole torso & rolls down at the top & rolls up at the bottom when you sit down. Deff nt what I expected! I guess if they had a 3x extra long then it may fit lol but I'm not really tall at all Abt average (5'4) hope this helps someone who wants an honest review & opinion. If your a toned skinny girl just lookin to have some extra cover or help give the perfect hour glass shape this will b fine for you, but if your a girl who is looking for help with that baby pooch or just a lil belly pooch in general something to show your curves more & flatten out that belly this item is NOT for you!
