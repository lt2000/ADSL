This was one of them. For your reference with regard to my photos, here are my 'stats':\n\n34 y/o\n5'7\"\n135lbs\n34A bra size (I know, I know...)\n\nI normally wear small or medium for my blouse size (more medium than small). In terms of my body shape, have broad shoulders, a long torso, longish lean arms, an hour glass waist but disproportionately large hips and booty booty. While I certainly can't see my abs, my stomach is probably a little flatter than the average woman's but I do have some love (hate) handles.\n\nOK, now that all of that fun stuff is out of the way, here's my review of this top. It arrived on time, and packaged very nicely! The color matched the pictures online which I always really appreciate. For the most part I was really pleased with the fit!\n\nUsually when I buy a top in size medium, it isn't quite as form fitting as this is. That's not a problem, it's just not the norm for me. Having tried on a handful of Patty tops now I can say confidently that I would feel uncomfortable in a small (in spite of my Dixie cup bra size). Be prepared that these tops/sweaters are really going to fit your form in whatever your normal size is. For that reason, I highly recommend ordering up a size if you're in doubt, unless of course you are built like the model (congratulations!), enjoy showing off your muffin top for all to see, or are planning to use major cleavage to distract eyes from looking at your midsection. Unfortunately I don't have cleavage. Even if I did, I'm more modest by nature, so I plan to wear this top with a cami.  That being said, the thicker fabric of this cardigan (unlike other Patty tops) will hide a multitude of \"sins\" haha.  So even if you've got a little pudge around the middle, it's not going to show.\n\nBeyond that, I really love this sweater! The fabric is soft and feels quality. The sleeves and torso are luxuriously long!! I can't tell you how refreshing it is to buy a sweater/top that is long enough for me in both the arms AND torso with length to spare!! Shorter women with shorter arms may struggle with all of these Patty tops just because they're so long. You may end up needing to fold or hem.  The pockets are actual pockets (not just faux pockets) but they are itty bitty.  Don't plan on actually using them much.\n\nTo sum up, I love the look and style of this sweater and think it could be worn in a lot of different ways!  I'm so happy to have found Patty Boutik! I LOVE the style and the quality and I can't wait to wear my new fall/winter wardrobe! Hopefully this is helpful for someone else. If it is, check out my reviews for several other PB garments!", "summary": "Love this cardigan!!  Flattering for any body type!!", "unixReviewTime": 1475452800}

The wallet feels leather-like and durable, and I love the zipper feature--nothing falls out! Cards fit snugly into the pockets inside; you might be able to squeeze two cards in a pocket, but there is no cramming four gift cards into one card pocket with this wallet. There is space on both sides of the coin pouch for cash or more cards. The coin pouch itself zippers nicely and is closed at the bottom so coins won't fall out into the bill space. It isn't made to hold as much change as my last wallet, but seeing as I don't tend to cart around tons of nickels and pennies with me, this doesn't bother me. The one downside is that, as the picture of the interior shows, your ID is going to be hard to get out. The bottom card pocket on one side has a clear front, so it's meant to be the spot for your driver's license...but have fun getting to it. Since the wallet doesn't open up flat, you can't just flip out the pocket and flash your ID while still in the wallet. You have to pry the actual card out. For me, this is a noticeable inconvenience, but not enough of one to make me regret the purchase or not want to use the wallet.\n\nOverall--great quality and ought to last a long time, holds an adequate amount of wallet-y stuff, and yay Star Wars!", "summary": "Fun and well-made, but getting to your ID could be easier.", "unixReviewTime": 1420243200}

Rose quartz offers many benefits- it is said to be the stone of the heart.  Although I am not super into metaphysical science, I do think anything can help you if you have an open mind to it.  Rose quartz is a great stone and is believed to be a high, calming and soothing energy, and it brings empathy, reconciliation, and forgiveness of others. In addition, it is believed to lower stress, clear your body and mind of anger, jealousy, and resentment; allowing emotional peace, tenderness and healing.  Further, it is said to promote health and calm in your life- so this is truly a stone that can only serve to help you; body and mind.  I will be wearing this everyday under my clothes and close to my heart- it is so pretty and I like to think it is soothing my soul as well.\nA very special thanks to the seller for allowing me to try and to write a review for your product- it is truly a blessing!\nI received this product at a discount or free in exchange for this honest, unbiased review.", "summary": "in LOVE- would give this a 10 star if I could!", "unixReviewTime": 1457308800}

So while I am regularly treated by a variety of medical doctors, I'd never turn anything down in terms of alternate treatments. So I jumped at the opportunity to get a healing piece of jewelry!\n\nIt arrived impressively quick despite the disclaimer of 10-21 days. I believe it was here within a week, which is awesome! I was prepared to wait and was pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe rose quartz gem was a surprisingly good size. I was very happy and impressed. The holder and chain are good quality as well.\n\nRose quartz' healing properties are as follows:\nThe meaning of rose quartz is it is the stone of unconditional love. Rose quartz crystals can heal many mental issues such as depression caused by low self-esteem and low self-worth. These rose quartz stones can reduce anxiety in the owner and fill them with calm when worn close to the heart chakra. Rose quartz crystals can increase fertility levels and can help protect the wearer from miscarriage. Rose quartz opens the heart chakra and allows the owner to accept love into their life, all types of love. Love for the family, yourself, platonic love and love in general for all creatures. By accepting love into your life this will lower stress levels.\n\nDepression, anxiety and stress are all definitely comorbid to my illnesses, for me. So I am excited to see if this wonderful gem can help when worn next to my heart!\n\nIt arrived well packaged and, as stated, in a more than timely manner. No issues in transit or delivery. Great customer service.\n\nAltogether I am very pleased for this purchase and excited to wear it regularly.\n\nI received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

There is a small amount of visible clear glue where the stone is set in its hanger.\nThe quality of the chain and metal hanger piece attached to the crystal has a costume jewellery look and is very light weight. The metal doesn't seem to be irritating to my skin and I tend to be very sensitive to cheap jewellery, although I have only worn this a few times but will update if this changes. The metal has not yet put off a strong odor.\nThe chain is a cable chain, different than the beaded chain pictured. It is extremely shiny and a very light material.\nOverall this is a nice piece of jewellery for someone to wear occasionally when dressing up but it doesn't look to be built for everyday use.\nI received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

However, it's not a coat in the traditional sense of what you might think a coat is, least of all a trench coat. It's a jacket, more like a suit jacket or a blazer. I expected a long coat and ended up with a suit jacket, so at first I was a little disappointed. But the material is comfortable, and rather than having a button to close the jacket there is a snap instead. Different, but doable. I also like the fold gray collar and sleeve on the navy blue; it's different.\n\nSince it's from, I believe, a Chinese clothing company it's often best to buy one to two sizes higher than what you usually wear. I used their recommended size chart and worked it out easily. I also suspect since the company is foreign maybe this is a long coat for the people's sizes in that country even if it isn't for my need. It may be the same for someone else who chooses to purchase this product.\n\nI could have returned it, but I ended up liking what I received.

My hands are on the small side of medium and it took a lot of wiggling for them to fit. They are warm and the leather seems to be good quality. But take very seriously their shipping estimate because they aren't overstating the wait as sometimes Amazon does. (They can sometimes say 3-5 days and it comes in 2.) The color is accurate and will go well with most medium to dark blues. But these are not navy gloves, which was something I was trying to avoid. Bows are attached securely also, which was  concern of mine. Overall, a good product if you have patience. With single digit temps while I waited, I want very patient.

This style is, by far my all-time favorite.\n\nI bought my Norah elsewhere in a different color, so I can only speak about the style rather than this particular color.\n\nFirst of all, this is a big bag, not a medium, so if you don't want something big, this is not the bag for you. I love the fact that the bag is a tall one, and that it has one big compartment. That way, I can open it up wide enough in order to see everything inside. This bag could easily hold my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 tablet if I wanted to carry it, plus a lot more.\n\nI like the two pen holders, as I use one for a pen, and another for my stylus. My LG V10, which is a big phone, fits in one of the two smaller compartments, so it's protected and easy to find. The larger zippered compartment is very roomy, and it holds everything I need it to hold.\n\nI'm a shoulder strap-kind of person, and the strap in this bag is long enough, and it's wide. I really hate it when manufacturers put thin shoulder straps on big bags!\n\nI also like the little \"feet\" on the bottom of the bag. They just add some extra protection when it has to sit on the floor.\n\nI have two suggestions for Brahmin. Please put an outside pocket on your bags. Also, please tone down the gold. A brushed gold would make the bag look more refined and elegant.", "summary": "My All-Time Favorite Bag!", "unixReviewTime": 1450137600}

The idea is great:  reading glasses that fold up inside a small sleeve attached to your phone, so you don't have to carry separate glasses.  But there are problems.  The first problem is that it is difficult to get them to fit comfortably and snugly on your nose.  I find that the glasses constantly move around or fall off.  The second problem is that the bridge (the part that attaches the glasses to your nose) is flimsy.  After using the glasses for awhile, one of the bridge pieces deteriorated, came loose, and ultimately fell off.\nThe third problem is the lack of customer service.  I have been unable to get a customer service rep on the phone, and the ThinOptics website says that they are experiencing a large call and email volume.  And it's not like the glasses are cheap.

She had seen this cover at the mall and begged me to buy it but it was so expensive there that I just couldn't spend that kind of money, twenty bucks, on it but I knew I could probably find one here and I did.  I was surprised when it arrived that it's really more of a cover than a case.  It's a soft rubber like cover that just slips right onto the back of the phone.  It fits perfectly and doesn't make the phone bulky like some case/covers do.  I was pleasantly surprised with the shipping time as I expected it to take much longer since it's coming from Asia but it got here in about two weeks.  Nice cover and pleased the recipient and the buyer! Do keep in mind that it's transparent somewhat so the phone color will show through. Looks nice on her black phone.\nNEW INFORMATION: Just a day after I posted this review, I noticed my daughter had tape on her phone.  Turns out that while all of the above was true in that it does fit well, isn't bulky, looks cute on her black phone and the shipping time was shorter than expected, that's not enough to overcome the biggest problem.  IT FELL COMPLETELY APART AFTER ONE WEEK.  It started on the top corner then the bottom...the plastic just split and began peeling away from the original shape. Granted, my kid is a typical teen in that her phone is with her 24/7, it still should have lasted longer. It may be fine for someone like myself who doesn't use the phone near as often, but I can't give this a good rating.  You really do get what you pay for!", "summary": "Cheaply Made Item Fell Apart", "unixReviewTime": 1427068800}

I'm not saying it's PERFECT or anything but it's a really great wig for the price. The wig isn't shiny like plastic, it does an amazing job of looking like real hair. It's long and the curls are perfect when it first arrives, I was surprised. It does tangle after a little bit but it's not that bad. I have a kind of big head and it fits okay but i have to pull it so my hair line won't show. The hair falls out a little but if you're gentle it shouldn't be a problem, overall i love what I got and it exceeded my expectations for ten dollars. Again I'm not saying it's as good as a $150 wig and if you are looking for something for everyday wear I WOULD NOT recommend it. However, if you are just looking for something fun and cute and don't want to invest big money into something, this is the way to go. I just wear it when I'm making YouTube videos so I don't have to worry about my own hair. quick and easy.

I wish I could return it, but due to travel and the delayed delivery, I couldn't return it in time for a refund. The punch is SUPER difficult to press - requires a lot of force. I couldn't get it to work at all (even on a piece of paper so it's the tool itself that's having trouble), but the gift recipient tried and got it to work with all his strength. When it finally did punch, we couldn't get the collar stay to come out in one piece. It kept on punching in half rather than as a full collar stay (which of course makes it useless). It's also dangerous - when he finally got it to work, the two pieces flew out and almost poked me in the eye. I'm hoping the one I got is a fluke given that the other reviews are good, but I definitely would not recommend.\n\n2) I ordered it with expedited shipping to get here in time for a gift, but what I received was an empty box. The box hadn't been tampered with and seemed to be in perfect condition, but was empty. Turns out, this was an Amazon error (rather than from Pick Punch LLC). I called Amazon and Pick Punch LLC and both were nice about getting me another shipment and waiving the next expedited fee.

It fit me just perfect!\n\n2: When you initially get the jacket in the mail, be sure to zipper it up and fold it \"inside-out\" before you wash it. There is a lot of leftover fur inside the jacket, hence why I folded it inside-out. make sure to do this every time you wash it to prevent the logo from fading/scratching.\n\n3: The Zipper. Be gentle with it whenever you zipper it up. It's not the highest quality zipper, but if your careful with it,it will last quite a while.\n\nThat pretty much sums up my review; I don't normally order clothes online, but I couldn't pass up this jacket (it was too cool!!!).

I am probably between a medium and a large in American sizes, and I tend to get a large since I don't like things that are very tight. I ordered a large and it fits great, honesty I could have probably gotten a medium and it would have fit (although maybe a little snug).\nAs another reviewer mentioned, there is no way to wear it as a dress as pictured on the model- I'm short (5\"1\") and the lace top layer falls right under my butt, the black under layer stops at about the middle of my butt. That doesn't bother me since I didn't intend to wear it as a dress anyways. I have tried it with leggings and a pair of skinny tan dress pants and it looks good with both.\nI read a review that mentioned the top was shear- which is partially true. the layer under the lace is definitely translucent so parts of your body that presses against the fabric maybe at least partially visible. For me this is only a problem at the bust, when I first tried it on I was wearing a light colored bra with a pattern and I could make out the bra pattern through the shirt. Easy fix, I just wear a black bra or a black tank top underneath and I'm good.\nYet another review mentioned the tight arms- this worried me most of all cause I have wide shoulders but the shoulder area of the top has plenty of space. The sleeves do get tighter below the elbow but the lace does have some stretch to it so there is some give to it.\nNow that the shirt has arrived I am actually kind of happy I didn't read the reviews first because if I had I probably would not have bought it which would have been a shame 'cause it is a very cute top. I may buy it in red as well.", "summary": "Super Cute", "unixReviewTime": 1426032000}

The chain also seem to be fairly sturdy.

The plastic loop is attached by plastic nubs on a strip stuck through holes on the other side of the strip, and it has good staying power but can be easily undone compared to other luggage tags. After a good bit of use I've found that the weak spot is that the plastic loops will pop undone every once in awhile if you catch a tag at an odd angle under something heavy, like another piece of luggage, and pry the loop at an odd angle while trying to pick up your luggage out of a pile. It's not a frequent issue but has happened to me twice now, no damage to the tag/loop though. Another downside is that the paper inserts are not protected from rain, which could get to be a pain if you travel a lot.

They are smaller, more practical, more discreet and just plain nicer. I don't want a shiny, huge, pink wallet that will carry the kitchen sink (as a girl, in theory, I have a handbag that can do that -- but I don't, either): I want a to-the-point wallet that will take currency, credit cards, my driver's license and a couple of receipts. No coins, no checkbook, no whatever else women carry in those huge wallets. And on days when for some reason I don't carry a handbag, they will fit into my front jeans pocket or interior coat pocket.\n\nI've been using zippered wallets for years, for the simple reason that I like it that stuff never falls out (I can do a great job of misplacing cash and credit cards on my own, thank you). There have been previous incursions into Amazon's apparently bottomless stash of zippered wallets. The wallets were okay, but with too many divisions, pockets, little nooks and crannies that ended up making them too large, too thick, too bulky, too complicated. And one of them had way too much padding, so even empty it felt huge.\n\nEnter the Mancini wallet. It is zippered. It is small. It has RFID -- I'd been using those little RFID envelopes for my credit cards, but an RFID wallet is so much more practical, especially because the envelopes have a nasty habit of falling apart. The compartments are perfect for me (and you can even remove the insert if you want to keep it VERY simple). It has two billfolds, something I always want because I travel a lot and can keep different currencies organized. The leather is soft and supple and the two-toned detail looks classy. Everything is well aligned and sewn together, and the zipper looks like it will last.\n\nThis may well be my wallet for a long time to come.", "summary": "Zippered. Small footprint. RFID.

They are the the ones with holes drilled for stringing. So, the necklace looks much cheaper up close. That said, from across a table, it's probably not noticeable. But I noticed immediately, and felt like it looked incredibly cheap (which--in all fairness--it was).\n\nThe first flaw I noticed upon opening was that the necklace I received did not have a chain to adjust the length (as pictured on the sale page). It is barely long enough to close. To be able to wear this necklace comfortably, I would need to add several links to the chain. It hardly seems worth it for the necklace, so I have yet to do so.\n\nIt's a lovely design concept, and if you don't mind something that looks rather costumey up close, and only appears classy from across a room (such as for stage jewelry or to go with an actual costume), this could be good for you.\n\nI will--most likely--cannibalize the parts for some other craft, such as a picture frame or some other household craft.\n\nI'm still giving 4 stars because based on a price point under $5, I don't think it's fair to rate this product against much higher quality jewelry. I deducted a star because of the chain being incomplete/broken/not a represented by the seller, and because I cannot say that I \"love it\" or would order it again. That said... for $4, it's not horrible.\n\nAnd who knows... I might actually wear the earrings one day...", "summary": "About what you'd expect for under $5", "unixReviewTime": 1472947200}

The page I ordered it from did not have a picture of the fonts available so I looked at another of their rings and sent them a message telling them what I wanted the ring to say. Since the ring comes in two band widths, 6mm and 8mm, I made sure to include that I wanted the 8mm width ring in the message. They responded really quickly and assured me I would get exactly what I wanted. Like I said once I saw the ring I just got too excited at how great it looked that I had to give it to him. He loved it as well he tried it on and it fit just right which I was afraid it wouldn't but Thorsten Rings offers a lifetime resizing for free which is great however reengraving has a $35 fee which isn't too bad. This ring is ceramic, I was going to get a ring made with tungsten but decided on this one instead and it was a good decision because the ring is super light so it doesn't weight down on his finger and since he isn't used to wearing a ring it is perfect since he doesn't even feel it on his finger which he really likes.

One suggestion I would make to the seller of the product is that slightly more protective packaging would probably be helpful. I get a lot of Amazon packages and this one arrived with some others.\n\n I didn't realize the belt was in a bubble-wrap type package. I tried to be careful in cutting the very top of the mailer / package where the package had been sealed shut. However, I was disappointed when I looked inside and realized the belt was just sitting loosely in the packaging. Apparently the belt had shifted up towards the top of the envelope (I couldn't feel it because it's pretty thin belt).\n\nI was bummed to discover I accidentally cut the belt in HALF when I was running my scissors along the top of the package!  I didn't ask for a replacement because technically it's my fault. But a belt with fabric would be best enclosed in something a little more sturdy to avoid cutting it. If you'd only ordered one item and knew it was the belt, you'd be more careful. But as I said, I order a lot from Amazon and I had several packages to open in the same day. So I'm here to order #2 since I can't wear the other one. :(", "summary": "Great Belt! Packaging Could Be More Secure", "unixReviewTime": 1512432000}

I have not used it as a daily bag but more of an occasional travel bag -- when I need it for a road trip or quick stay at the family house.  I also use it every now and again as a gym bag.  Let me just say, this is an exceptional piece of equipment for the money.  When I first opened it 2 years ago, it did have a funny smell.  That dissipated over a week, and of course has not since returned.  The piece feels very durable for the price and many (Read ALL) people are fooled into thinking it is leather.  Other reviewers that comment on its shininess --- there are nice quality leathers out there that shine just like this.  When it first arrived, yes, a bit too shiny, but as it has aged, it has begun to really fool people.\n\nPros:\n*Very Handsome\n*High Quality zippers seem to slide with ease\n*Looks like leather\n*Arrives quickly, and well packaged\n\nCons:\n*This is a cheap bag -- please do not expect it to hold up if you mistreat it and abuse it like you would a normal leather bag.  This needs a bit more care to make it last longer but with the extra $300 i saved by not buying a saddleback, I think its very much worth it.", "summary": "Great bag, treat it with care and it will be 5 stars", "unixReviewTime": 1481587200}

The inner lining has also split at the seam exposing the polyester fill.  The hood is also a problem.  That gray flap that looks so cute on the model hangs down over my eyes.  I guess I could consider it a visor to keep down-coming snow out, but then I can't see where I am going and risk walking into a drift.

That being said, this is my first mono-hand watch, so the experience is quite unique and does require some time to get used to.\nI have been contemplating on buying a mono-hand watch for a while, and having settled on the Botta brand, I have to say was treading to unknown territory. The other brands that I was considering were Meistersinger, Defakto and Danish Design.\nThe Meistersinger was dropped due to the hefty price tag of its models. Defakto offered a beautiful mono-hand under the \"Eins\" range. It's uncluttered and clean dial is a superb example of the minimal Bauhaus design. But the 42mm and protruding lugs would look ridiculously large on my average wrist (7.2\"). So that was dropped. There was the striking and lovely looking mono-hand watches from Danish Design, very minimal and clean. However, the price was a bit steep for such a  brand and the dial and bezel combination that I wanted wasn't available. So Botta it was.\nNow, the next big question was which UNO version should I opt for, the 40mm or 44mm? I have an average wrist and have owned watches that have a diameter between 38mm to 42mm. The usual decision would have been the 40mm, given my wrist size. However, something kept on nagging me to get the 44mm, so the 44mm it was.\nThe watch arrived two days later, placed snugly in foam which was within a cylinder. The packaging is very eye catching and unique. Very well thought out and efficient. It all echoes the brand's minimal approach to design, which I find to be refreshing.\nThe watch appeared to be a bit intimidating at first, given the wide white dial and space. However, given the lugless and flat design, the watch rests comfortably on smaller wrists. The more I look at the dial, the more I'm convinced that I made the right choice for selecting the 44mm. There's no way to precisely tell the time in a mono-hand watch in small dial. The generous wide face lends a hand in telling time more accurately.\nMy only gripe with this watch would be the supplied leather band. It's one of those stiff type leather that's not malleable which tends to show cracks quickly. Oddly, it adds to the large size of the watch on an average sized wrist. A quick change of the band to a suede leathered strap helps a lot and enhances the experience.\nThe watch I have now is actually a replacement to the watch I received earlier. I was adjusting the time when the crown came loose. I requested a replacement and received one the next day. The seller is very prompt, attentive and very accommodating. An added plus for a new watch experience, especially that of the mono-hand. This watch is a welcome addition to my timepiece collection. Definitely a keeper that adds a more relaxed approach to time measurement.", "summary": "A Different Approach to Tell Time...A Relaxed One", "unixReviewTime": 1445990400}

If you find it doesn't fit quite as you like- but want the same look- the leather in this cuff is thick enough that you can add an extra hole or two  into it if done carefully; or you can wear this one notch looser than you usually would.  The one I got stayed stiff enough that it doesn't slide around much even if you wear it looser and do not happen to have the wrist of a body builder. (as most don't)  The cuff looks better in person than it does in the picture...the contrast between the leather and metal works well and doesn't scream LOOK AT MY WRIST THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT ON MY WRIST as you might think from the picture.  Seems well made though keep In mind any leather can dry out and crack over time and adding conditioner paste to a cuff that isn't plain might not be worth the mess.  But overall if you want to bulk out your wriist or accessorize with other black items you wear this is probably a good choice cuff.  Hope this helps", "summary": "It Softens Up Well", "unixReviewTime": 1447545600}

Mason", "reviewText": "I thought this item was very poorly made. It has loose ends that were not tied off. It was also covered in pieces of red yarn, which had to be removed piece by piece. The important issue with this review, is that it is allowed to be read by other customers, and not pulled by Amazon as \"an issue I need to contact the seller about!\" It is NOT my dissatisfaction with an item I did not like due to just poor quality.  Nor is it about receiving a complicated return process.  I believe items such as this should have a strict code that needs to be passed before selling to any consumer.  I know this and other like items are a health hazard. Here is why;  I could not get the smell of pesticides out of the garment.  I have had this happen before and did look into what the smell was. It smells very similar to diesel or petrol and sometimes it is a combination of all these things. I knew the minute I opened the package what I was dealing with. I cannot have any such item near me due to the odor, which exacerbates my migraines. There are many pesticides that are legal in other countries that are NOT legal in the USA. Beware if you are allergy prone or just do not want something as dangerous as poison next to your skin. It is also highly flammable. I left this sweater outside in below zero degree temps for days and it still smelled just as strong when I brought it back into the house. I would warm customers buying from foreign countries as this is not the first time I have had this problem with items (especially anything made from yarn or wool) having this heavy smell.  I was contacted by email stating I could get a refund if I went through a complicated return process. I am more concerned about the health and safety of others and will not be spending my time going through this that and the other to return something I believe to not only be a very poorly made product but one that makes me ill to even have it in my home. I wrapped it in the packaging it came in, and deposited the nasty thing into last weeks trash. The sweater not only smells of chemicals but it was not easy getting the smell off my hands after touching it. There is actually a greasy feel to the yarn. Beware of these products.

I bought these because I wanted some cheap (but polarized) sunglasses for being outside in the summer.  Polarized is a must for me as I like how they cut the glare.

The metal of the frames is very light - probably pretty susceptible to being broken or smooshed but the glasses wholly lived up to my expectations.  They sit lightly on my face.  I'd say lens color appears pretty much as advertised and I checked them against another pair of polarized lenses - they are indeed polarized.  All-in-all, it's a good purchase if you're seeking a decent looking inexpensive pair of polarized sunglasses.\n\nI went 4 stars instead of 5 because they are what I expected and what I was looking for but didn't knock my socks off in any special way.

These fit the bill with some to spare! The only thing to keep in mind is that they do run small!

I needed an inexpensive everyday watch and this is perfect. There were other reviewers who complained that it did not keep time properly, but I have not had that issue. I have had this almost a week and it is still keeping perfect time. It is a manual watch which means no batteries and you DO have to wind it. I actually like that idea! The watch looks great and I love the clear front and back to see the gears.\n\nThe only reason it is not a 5 star is the watch band is a little big for what was supposed to be a women't watch. I think my wrists are average size and I had to put in another notch since the smallest one was still too big and the heavy watch face would cause the watch to turn around on my wrist. Very annoying for someone who sits and types at a computer all day. Also the watch face was a lot larger than I thought it would be, but I have gotten used to it. If it was too small it would be pointless to have the clear front to see the inner workings.\n\nFor the money, it's a great watch! I wind it a little each day and so far no problems. Again, it has kept perfect time since I received it early this week and you just have to remember to wind it.\n\n****UPDATE****\nI did love the watch, but the pin broke that winds the watch and changes the hands. The pin is no longer locking properly and therefore the hands are not moving consistently. I am so very disappointed since I really did love this watch when I first got it. I made sure not to over wind the watch and was very careful with it. So, it was great at first, but now it's completely useless.

It was nicely packaged in a neat gift box.  It also came with a small gift card for personalization, however since is was obviously meant for Christmas giving I was unable to use it. I would suggest that a more generic gift card be included if that is to be an extra perk.  The watch itself was very nice looking and it was easy to set the time. I gave it as a gift to a young man for his 18 birthday. I removed the long chain it came with-- I thought it seemed cheap-- and attached it to a shorter brass \"fob\" that I purchased so it would be more useful as a pocket watch instead of a medallion. He seemed very pleased with the watch, though assuming he would be using it as an heirloom piece as suggested seemed a bit of a stretch.  Although it claims to be made of stainless steel, it has been made to look like brass, but feels much too lightweight, almost like more of a hard resin instead of metal, which takes away from its \"antiquity\" feel, in my opinion.  The one I received was embossed with the USS CONSTITUTION which was appropriate for my nephew who is a Navy dependent.  The fact that the watches are available in a variety of shapes and imprints-- some even being engraveable-  makes them ideal gift ideas for some. Time will tell if it, well-- keeps good time, which is pretty much the most important feature of a watch!

The fading is pretty obvious considering the pattern is dark and it turned white on the knees and feet. Pretty disappointing for something that cost thirty five bucks. But my son didn't mind.

My daughter(almost 3) is extremely petite (height & weight,15 percentile) and I'm afraid it may be too short by the time I want her to wear it. I would say order a size up. Also the Aqua blue shown isn't correct it's more of a blue, like Elsa's dress in the movie.\n\nJust for reference my daughter just started to fit into 2T shirts in January and they are always long and roomy.

It has this faux Chinese style button like ribbons button that are just really nice and gave the back of this dress an interesting look.\n\nAs for the fabric, this dress uses a lace fabric and a polyester lining I think. The lace is not the greatest but I think is good enough for the price. The fabric use for this dress is ok, is comfortable to wear and not scratchy like how cheaper lace sometimes feels against the skin. I washed this dress using delicate cycle settings and I place this inside a laundry bag to make sure the lace doesn't get caught in other clothing hardware like buttons or zippers. As for drying, I have dry this using low heat settings and line drying, although I prefer line drying for my clothes that are made in laces.\n\nAs for the workmanship, this dress looks neat on the outside. All the seams are neatly done and trimmed. However on the inner side of the dress, I can see some threads that needs trimming.

A small dab of clear nail polish stopped the tiny hole in the foot and kept them in service for yet another wearing. This maybe the most durable pair of sheer pantyhose I've ever worn.\n\nLook: Picture tell it all, it is very shiny look. It is really obvious that one is wearing tights. I got a lot of compliments for this.\n\nOverall Rating: At the price of 9 USD, for 5 wearings , the cost per wear on these is going to be under $2.00.

It isn't \"fluffy\" like the others and the fabric although claims to be the same as the others feels very unpleasant. The photo I included has three tutus I have purchased online. The cobalt blue is from the seller on top and its tiny compared to the other two. The pink it from zulily also a small and the tourquise is a competitors tutu bought on Amazon in a size small too. The only one that has three layers is the zulily one and it has three and its reversible which comes in handy for photo shoots. The two competitor tutus cost around 20 a piece and this one was 11.50 the one positive about this tutu is that is has an \"adjustable\" waist band that can grow with your child. Nice touch but if you notice the hole for the biggest adjustment on the tutu I received is torn :(\n\nOn the bright side this did come an entire month early then the expected shipping time.\n\nI will wash this and see if I can make this work but it most likely will be a donation item.

Anyways, the bracelet itself is beautiful and I'm extremely happy with it. Any Harry Potter fan will take one look at it and know exactly what the three separate charms mean. I don't understand how people are breaking theirs so easily. I have five bracelets like this one and another on its way. I've had them for an absolute minimum of 8 months (forgot to do reviews for a lot of the things I purchased haha) and I've worn ALL of them multiple times and never had an issue. Then again I'm smart enough to know I need to be gentle with \"cheap\" jewelry. Some people just don't think things through. Be gentle and you'll have no problem - at least not for a very long time. And sure accidents do happen but I really do believe most of these people are being too rough and quick. The chain has multiple loops to latch onto so it will fit different wrist sizes as well.

The one I received has a lighter color of leather, and the Golden Snitch is a See-through Yellow Snitch instead (I guess they ran out of gold beads or something, haha).\n\nAlso, depending on your wrist size, it may be a bit large.

The color that shows in the picture (which looks the same when I took a picture) is not true life the purse actually has a more greenish blue that is very pretty. The outer side pockets and top clasp are magnetic closures. The back zipper closure does hold a 9mm Ruger with no problems. The inside has a center zippered pouch and side zippered pouch with good amount of room on each side of the center pouch. The top zipper closure for the purse was a negative for me because it leaves either end open (I will provide a picture). The purse itself feels heavier than what I'm use to but really isn't an issue as I wanted the purse because of the back zippered pocket.\nDisclosure: I received this product at a discount for my honest review.

However the leaves do not stay in place for very long. They're not connected to one another so after walking around they eventually slip apart so that one leaf is up against your throat and the other is dangling down between your breasts. It is something that can very easily be fixed though. You can easily use a small dab of super glue to connect the pieces together in any way you choose. it does defeat the style of this necklace but considering it does not look cheap and looks as if I actually spent $20 or more on it, I'd say a dab of super glue is totally worth it. For that reason I DO RECOMMEND this necklace. long as you don't mind constantly readjusting or gluing it in whatever specific way you want.\nSorry for the blurry pictures. Didn't feel like doing it over and over again so that's what you get. Just showing you how it's \"supposed\" to look and what happens after a few minutes. Also you can see some of the silver rusted so here's some advice...\n***** ADVICE ***** With ALL cheap jewelry you get you absolutely must put on a clear coat of nail polish (doesn't have to be expensive; I just use a 99cent bottle) so that the color doesn't fade - so it remains shiny. Also, the clear coat will make sure your skin doesn't turn green. Don't slop it on! You only need a small amount, a regular layer evenly distributed. Don't rush it either. Take your time. Do half the chain, hang it from a table, let it dry, do the other half, etc. I put a clear coat on my jewelry every 6 months to a year depending on how often its worn, if I went swimming with it on, been in the sun all day, etc. Those things make me put it on even more.", "summary": "I DO recommend BUT read my review first!", "unixReviewTime": 1449964800}

I started with this style because it looked durable.  At first I ordered a medium based off some advise my more experienced corset wearers. It was to small but the error was 100% on me. My girlfriend was expressing her want to start tight-lacing also. So, I gave that one to her and order the size indicated by the chart. It fits and is very durable! However, I should have gone down from the XXL (37 inch natural waist) to the XL for costuming the XXL would be great! The product is actually really good the only issue I see with it is the under bust top is very loose and gaps. I know there is a break in time or \" seasoning\" time but I just don't like how it woulds lay either way. I think this is just because of my personal body shape. My measurement are 42 bust, 37 waist 41 hips. Overall it is a good product the advice I was given was if you want it for waist training drop 6 inches from your natural wist size. So I would need and XL. like I said the mess up was my error. The only reason there is a 4 instead of a 5 is the top part gaping and I think that has to do with me but I am a novice so I am unsure.\n\nUPDATE!  I had high hopes for this item but the gaps have never gone away. It makes it a terrible fit. It is super tight on my waist and way to big on my natural waist.

The quality of the material was amazing for the price, but the part where the hips flare out was extremely wide even in the smallest size that I ordered. This corset seems to be made for people who have smaller chests and wider hips (like myself) but the flare at the hips was just too much.

The blue fell apart immediately, and the red Well, I pried it apart with my fingernails. Why? Well, for starters, the two acrylic rhinestones inside each weren't attached to one another, so by swapping them I was able to have two pendants which were both blue on one side and red on the other. The other reason? So I could attempt to glue them together more securely. I mean, if one came apart in the package, it was only a matter of time for the other.\n\nMy first attempt at repair was straight-up super glue. This worked flawlessly to bind the rhinestones together (Which by the way were somehow all scratched up, but not noticeably from a distance) but didn't work on the metal piece so much. When I used nail polish remover to remove the glue residue so I could try something difference (Nail polish remover is the only thing that can dissolve super glue) the cheap paint on the pendants began dissolving faster than the glue, exposing the raw copper underneath. Well. This is lovely. Hey, maybe I can remove all the paint on purpose and use a silver plating kit on the remaining copper! maybe. OK, most people aren't as handy as me, and wouldnt have a silver plating kit just sitting in their toolbox. But whatever. Thats something I haven't gotten to trying just yet.\n\nThe one that was more salvageable (as in there was no super glue residue in a noticeable place) Ive sealed back together with epoxy and attached to a short leather necklace via a brass chainmail link. The nice contrast that the gold and jewel make with the leather makes it look a dozen times more authentic than the garbage chain it came with; I wear it as standard jewelry and not a costume piece, and get compliments on it all the time. If I want it to be red or blue, I just flip it over. Easy-peasy.\n\nStill. It should have been in wearable condition and not falling apart to begin with. I should not have had to get creative with epoxy and super glue and Wal-Mart craft department supplies to make the piece presentable. The jewels should not have been all scratched up!\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS unless you have the means by which to do at-home jewelry repair, because it WILL BREAK.", "summary": "DO NOT BUY THIS unless you have the means by which to do at-home jewelry repair, because it WILL BREAK.", "unixReviewTime": 1494892800}

Besides the cute design idea for this outfit, there is nothing else good about this because even the design is poorly executed!

The stripe colors are go in the front, does not wrap around, the backside is a solid gray, which isn't bad just confusing because it would have been cuter to continue the pattern all around.\n\n2nd the snaps are cheap plastic. Not horrible BUT these same cheap plastic snaps are used for the buttons down the front of the romper BUT they have no backing on those ones so the bottom snap digs into your child's skin, a big issue if you have a crawler or someone still doing tummy time. It hurt me and I only pressured my finger into it. Imagine it being your chest having several things digging into your skin and you couldn't tell someone what hurts?!?\n\n3rd, It fits way too small!  My son is\n6 months weighs 22.4 lbs and is  26.5 inches long, he wears 9-12 months clothes depending on brand. Knowing this ran small, I ordered this in 18-24 months.  The legs are way too short and the arms are longer, especially compared to the legs. My son has bigger legs (chub rolls) so I was not able to snap it closed. He also has really long legs and had high waters in this outfit, but the sleeves were long where I would need to roll them up. I've posted a couple pictures as examples.\n\n4th: care tag recommends dry cleaning, who has time for that?!?! Especially for children's clothes?!?!\n\nLastly, the size is not listed anywhere on this outfit, it's not on any of the tags attached to it or the paper store tags, I had to check my Amazon order to confirm what size I bought.\n\nI will be returned this outfit.\n\nPlease note, I received this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.", "summary": "Not for a chubby baby or a baby with long legs or both!!", "unixReviewTime": 1463184000}

I always like to get clothes that are blue because they make his blue eyes stand out even more. When I saw this one piece, I fell in love with how cute the little bow tie looks. I ordered this in 18-months, although my nephew is only 1-year. I figured that it will fit him by the time that it becomes cooler later in the year. I placed the order and this was shipped to me quickly. This is SO cute. The material is great quality and I did not see any loose threads. Before I gave it to my brother, I did iron down the bow because it was folded over and creased from the packaging. He loved this and can't wait to put it on his son.

Judging by its weight, I'm guessing it will be most appropriate for temperatures in the high-30s to low-50s (while running, absent windchill).\n\nUPDATE: I finally had the opportunity to use it tonight and it worked great. 44 degrees F with a moderate wind or of the south.

I received this item in the mail, and when the description says tiny, it is accurate. The butterfly itself is is only 1/4 inch by 1/4 inch, and will fit inside a dime. The necklace measures just under 8 inches when held by the clasp, so the total length isn't 18 inches, it's just under 16 inches. I've added a picture to show the size of the butterfly in comparison to a dime.\n\nLuckily, I was purchasing this for my 7 year old daughter, who absolutely adores it. It is small and feminine, not too shiny and so far it's been durable enough for a 7 year old to wear it without breaking. The clasp is easy to open and close and the butterfly doesn't \"flip over\" during wear. The necklace is the perfect gift for a young lady, but seems a bit small to me, for a full grown woman.\n\nDisclaimer: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

I was hesitant to buy this since there were no reviews, but I received a discount on the necklace for my own review, so I took the plunge!\n\nThe necklace was Prime eligible and arrived in 2 days.  This is pretty rare for Amazon jewelry at this price point, I usually find it comes from overseas and takes weeks to get.  It arrived in a huge lightly padded envelope which offered very little protection and is a waste of materials.  Luckily, the necklace was safe and sound, sealed in a small plastic baggie with a cute business card/thank you from the seller, who is a small California based business.\n\nThe necklace arrived twisted with a small knot, so I fixed that up and noticed instantly how SHORT the chain was.  I only wear 18-21\" chains and I knew immediately this was not the 18\" that was promised in the product description.  I measured it and it came in under 16\".  It was almost a choker on me.  However, both the chain and the butterly are lightweight and comfortable.  The butterfly sits nicely without constantly flipping over and the wings are soft, rounded edges, so it is comfortable to wear.  I just switched the pendant out to another chain.  The chain itself isn't bad.  Basic chain that you find with most costume pendant necklaces.  The clasp is easy to open/close and is secure.\n\nThe butterfly itself is adorable!  It is not quite as shiny as I saw online, which I prefer, because it gives it a nicer look.  The metal (it is described as bronze) does not bend or misshape and the detail on the butterfly is pretty.  I am glad that the butterfly isn't tiny. It is dainty and perfect for a simple look.\n\n It is appx 1/4\" x 1/4\" for people like me that don't measure in millimeters.\n\nFor the price, the detail of the butterfly and the 2 day prime shipping, this was a great buy and I will wear the butterfly often this summer on another chain and on a charm bracelet.  However, minus 2 stars as the chain was 2+\"  shorter than described and a better packaging solution would offer more protection to the item and less waste (no loss of stars for packaging).  I hope seller fixes the description of the chain size to match the actual product.", "summary": "Adorable Pendant.  Chain is NOT 18\".", "unixReviewTime": 1468195200}

Unfortunately the makers of those coin purses have decided to use a very soft glove leather. That is fine and well for gloves, but is far too soft for that type of coin purse. As a result, that type of coin purse will not even hold its own shape much less hold any coins. That has required a search to find a new style of coin purse.

I was very frustrated because there are no pictures of the necklace anywhere on the listing and I didn't read the description to find out I wasn't buying the diadem.

Once the kids otgrow the back strap, it can be moved forward and they will be able to get some more time out of them. (They will get lots of use before the kids grow out of them)\n\nThe last set that we bought had the lining on the outside a bit as well as the inside and they always had leaves and whatever else from outside all over them. I like that these have the same soft lining, but only on the inside. My kids both still love them and it does not appear that they are any less comfortable.\n\nWe spend a lot of time outside and do a lot of camping and bonfires and my kids like to have slippers to wear for these events. Running around outside would wreck most slippers, so I've pretty much fallen in love with these. They're cozy on the inside but the outside is easy to clean so I can just wash them off and they're like new again. After a rinse off and a towel dry, the kids can still wear them around the house without leaving a mess.\n\nI could rave forever about these. They are one of a select few products that I will keep on replacing as my kids grow out of them because they are so perfect for out needs and they just make life easier. I would absolutely recommend. And, after having bought the ones that have the fuzzy exterior as well, I would recommend these first if your kids will ever wear them out of the house.", "summary": "One of my absolute favorite kid products - makes my life much easier and worth every penny!", "unixReviewTime": 1492992000}

In second, it looks like a slim fit on the upper part in picture, but it is not like that in the reality. In third, the buttons on the picture showed to be black. However, they are purple in my case. In fourth, the description says that it contains 30% wool, but in my opinion it doesn't contain any. I have gourmets that contain only 5% of it and it still give them a specific texture. I didn't feel this with this coat. The item is not thin as it would be expected from a jacket, but looks and feels more like a coat. I also was not able to find any confirmation on the coat itself that it contains any wool. As one of the reviews recommend, I ordered L when I usually wear XS.
