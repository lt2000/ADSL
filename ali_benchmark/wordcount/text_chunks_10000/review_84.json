Put the \"For fire safety, These pajamas should fit snugly\" into pretty funny perspective.

Some things that you need to know about me and socks, I never ever match, I like different kinds in the pack so I do not have to match my dryer eats socks anyway so what is the point of matching socks, I wear a 7 -8 shoes and I have very wide feet, and I wear low top shoes mostly athletic. These socks are very low cut and fit great with the type of shoes I wear. With me having wide feet I always have to buy size 9-11 or they do not fit right and slide down in the shoe as I walk which is very annoying. These socks fit correctly so no socks show but they are not small enough to where they slide when I walk or jog. If you have ever had a sock slide when you walk, jog, exercise you know how annoying it feels to keep having to pull it up or remove the shoe and pull on the sock when you are trying to work out it makes the workout longer and more annoying.\nI wear converse low tops and I have a pair of new balance running shoes that I wear constantly they show a little more with my converse but that really does not bother me, they hardly show at all when I wear my new balance shoes. These came in a variety of designs the colors are all either black, white or grey which is ok I would have liked more color choices at the time of purchase I am all about mixing and matching colors. I love the material it is not too thick to wear my shoes do not fit but not thin to where it feels like I am not wearing any socks. The material is somewhere in the middle and not itchy, they are soft probably cotton if I had to guess. The elastic on them is great not too tight so there are no rings around my ankle area when I remove them. These socks came with no rips or tears or loose seams.\nOver all I am pleased with this purchase I got 12 pairs of socks, that fit the right way that I like and that are not too thick and uncomfortable that I cannot get my shoes on. The designs are perfect, were I wish there were more color choices the white, black, and grey different designs still allow me to mix and match.

I wear a size 10, and they are hard to get over my heel without feeling like they're going to rip. Not bad enough to be a total deal breaker, but a wee bit more room would be nice. The animal patterns are great- I love wearing leopard and tiger stripes, etc. and I always wear ankle or no-show socks, so they are perfect for me in that respect. The patterns are woven, not printed, so that means a LOT of loose thread inside the socks, which can be kind of annoying, as even a little rough spot on a toenail can snag in them.

It is so unique that he's getting compliments galore.  You're probably wondering why only three stars.  The reason for this is that the watch came with no instructions, none!  There are only two buttons so it shouldn't be difficult to figure out, right?  Wrong!  I spent over 1/2 hour trying to get this set for him before I gave it to him and I finally managed to get the date and time.  I have not been able to figure out how to use the alarms nor have I been able to figure out how to set the display so that it lights up every 5 minutes (or whatever allocated time period we want).  I don't even know what other features it has because the instructions are missing.  I sent an email to the seller and have not received any response.  I actually went to a competitor's product on Amazon that has the exact same watch with a different name and I read their reviews and found some instructions from other reviewers which helped me to get as far as I did.  Frankly, if I had it to do over again, I'd buy from the other supplier because their reviewers at least noted that set up was easy due to the enclosed instructions their product came with.\n\nI received a discount for this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.  I know many potential buyers get concerned when they see someone has received a discount in exchange for a review as they worry that the review may be inflated.

I also doubt the stretch would get me more than 7 months along across the belly.

It's an akward fit and made for someone with a short torso making a small for me WAY to snug and a medium still snug but not as tight against my chest. A large probably would have been good length wise but bigger everywhere else.\nIf I work out some more I might feel a lot better in it. Nice material, not see through either.

This is my new every day carry watch for sure. My old watch was a swiss army one that I put on a 2 inch leather band. I really liked it but over time the leather got smelly and was hard to care for.

Looks really cool with the oversize face like those invicta or more expensive watches. Even though the band is plastic or some type of composite, I like it because it is very, very easy to clean. Just damp and wipe down and that is it. Couldnt be any easier. So far it has kept time perfectly. I do not have any gripes at all.

I really was attracted to the tunic design. I like tops that don't cling and force me to wear undergarments. I am a size 12 and after reading all the prior reviews on this top, I decided to go one size up and order the XXL. Normally I wear a size XL. This top ended up being PERFECT and fitting exactly like how an American XL would fit. So whatever size you are normally, DO size up ONE size and it will be exactly the right fit.\n\nI purchased the ombre Royal blue. This is NOT a royal blue. This is turquoise fading to dark turquoise. There is no royal blue color at all in this. I was OK with that because turquoise is actually my favorite color to wear. The Amazon photograph is actually VERY accurate for what this top looks like and the color. However, I believe the seller should consider renaming the color choice as it creates confusion. The ombre is a beautiful deep color combination. The fade is gradual and it creates a flattering color combination. I appreciate the dark color being on the bottom  it actually is very slimming. The turquoise is very jewel tone and rich.\n\nThe fabric on this top is almost see through, so I ended up wearing a cami. This top is PERFECT for summer. It is light and airy. It does not cling and it allows the skin to breath. I took a photograph against a window so you could see how the fabric looks when you hold up the top. If you are getting a dark color like black, and wear a black bra underneath it should be ok. If you are getting a light color, you may need to wear a cami I am not sure. The ombre one I got is dark but I still wanted coverage. This top is SOOOO comfortable though, but in the winter you would need to wear a jacket with it.\n\nThe bottom has a stretchable banding on it that holds it close to the body. It looks so cute with a pair of tight blue jeans. The neckline is scoop but not too low. The sleeves are not tight but just perfect. They also have elastic banding and a slight ruche to the shoulder. I throw this in the wash on cold, delicate cycle with mild detergent. I then hang dry it. It does NOT fade or shrink, it comes out looking like new. I wouldnt really recommend drying this in the dyer, I don't know what the fabric would do. This top looks so stylish and cute, its great for church but also going out. 5/5 stars\n\nIf you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

I delayed writing this review until wearing the set for awhile.\n\nThe set arrived displayed on a standard cardboard jewelry display card and is a cute little Red Fox set containing a necklace, earrings and bracelet all made of metal with red stone/plastic inserts used in each item.  I examined all the pieces closely checking for missing or broken parts and tested the quality by gently tugging on the links, clasps and hooks to see if anything was insecure, but all remained intact and secure.\n\nThe bracelet is a chain link style with decorative circular metal discs and links plus a small fox holding a red oval and a standard crab/lobster claw chain clasp. The earrings are small metal foxes holding a red oval hanging from standard hooks for pierced ears. The necklace has a larger fox holding a red oval hanging from a popcorn chain that reflects the metal design of the foxes. I found the metal clasp on the bracelet a little stiff to open when it arrived and have arthritis in my fingers which doesn't help but have small hands so used the furthest link to attach it and now just slip it onto my wrist.\n\nThis is a cute little set that is suitable for day wear or to brighten up an otherwise plain outfit - I am allergic to metal so unable to wear the earrings for more than a couple of hours without them becoming irritated, but have worn them out a few times while the necklace and bracelet has had plenty of wear!

I'm normally an xs but ordered a small and the fit was great for what I wanted (fitted); shoulders are a bit narrow but not so much that it takes from the shape.  As others have stated, the quality is great for the price, even at $60 the quality would warrant the price (except for that sad little hanging button we all have to refasten).\n\nThe things I didn't like are the things you can't see in the blurry photo (should have been my first clue).  I've been looking for 2 years for a white blazer I can wear open with straight, clean lines; from the image, it appears as if you can.  However, it doesn't quite fall the same way.  Doable, but I'm settling because I'm not wasting money on shipping.\n\nThe shoulders aren't puckered, but there is a gathered double seem which is okay, but again, I didn't see in the picture and wouldn't have ordered if the details were visible.\n\nAlso, you cannot see the seem that runs just below the rib cage.  I didn't see that in the image and would not have purchased (I know that sounds trivial but I liked the lines of the jacket the way they appeared without that seem).\n\nI've attached images of the jacket (pre-ironed as well- sorry) that show it closed and open, plus a close up of the seem and cut of the jacket.  The jacket is lined and ironed well and easily.\n\nOverall, the quality is fantastic, the fit is how I want it, but it simply does not match the picture, and that's why I took off two stars.  I feel angry as if it was on purpose (whether or not it was or wasn't, it's how I feel when I spend my money on something that doesn't meet my expectations.

Additionally, the company included an extra set of backings just in case the others get lost.  So, overall these earrings are pretty and I'm happy with them.  Now, there are two reasons why I didn't give them a 5 star. One was because even though they are pretty, you can up close that they are kinda on the cheap side. Second of all, they were really hard to put on. It took me a long time just to get these beauties on and I ended up just having my husband help me.

As a customer, I have always depended quite heavily on customer reviews based on prior purchases. In my experience, it has been more reliable than descriptions or specs could ever be. Not to mention a great source of advice on the best way to maximize the product that you are receiving whether for installation, assembly or even just recommendations on improving on products that may have weaknesses while still being considered a good product. I rely heavily on the experiences of previous customers and their experiences, so I do take reviewing items seriously and try to cover points that I may want to consider in a purchase. That being said, please note my reviews are honest and unbiased and if you would like to review past product reviews for reference, please feel free to visit my profile. You are welcome to let me know if you have any questions on this product that I may be able to assist with or pertaining to something that I may not have covered. Please also be sure to like this review if it has been helpful in your purchasing decisions.\n\nI ordered this for our toddler recently and we received it in the mail this week. Very simple packaging, so all was well there. The outfit is an adorable piece to have in her wardrobe. A little something different than what you can usually find in the stores so I was pretty quick to order it for her. I did order it a size larger than what her size is. All too often, things that are ordered online come in too small so I usually do order that way as a safe bet. That being said, I really did need to, not at all. It actually seems like it is a little bit bigger than the size it is said to be, especially in length and she is already a tall girl. So it will be a little bit longer than I expected before she can wear it. That is not a horrible thing since it should last a little bit longer than most things do. I was just really excited to have her wear it because this romper is SUPER CUTE! I love the patter of it and the matching headband, simple and sweet.

The black leather is very nice, pretty even. Smooth to the touch, but gives the impression of strong and sturdy.\nThe bag isn't huge, but it's large enough to be a carry bag for traveling. I can fit all of my traveling supplies, and then some. I would probably use this as an overnight bag, or when I need to bring a lot of extras for me and the family. Would make an excellent gift for a business man/woman who does a lot of traveling.\n\nThe inside of the bag is very spacious. Easily zips and unzips, even after shipping and the bag was a little flattened.\n\nPros: Wonderful traveling bag\n  Incredibly well made\n  Thick strong leather that will hold up for lots of use\n  Looks bad***\n\nCons: None\n\nOverall: The bag is really not that expensive when you consider what you're getting. If you're in the market for a leather travel bag, you have to be willing to spend a little bit. And for this price you're getting an amazing bag!! The quality is top notch. It truly is. This would make a wonderful gift or gift for yourself. I am incredibly please with this bag!!\n\nI did receive this in exchange for my unbiased review.", "summary": "The black leather is very nice, pretty even", "unixReviewTime": 1464307200}

It also fit our baby differently. Who would make baby overalls without snap on is beyond me. So to change out baby I had to take overall off completely and it is inconvenient to say the least if you are not at home. A lot of places don't have changing stations and you have improvise at times and this just make it so much harder. If I knew it wasn't a snap on at the bottom would not have ordered it. We got this for our private wedding ceremony, in hopes for baby's comfort and to match daddy's suit, so by the time it arrived there was no time to order something else. The quality is also very poor. The threads were hanging off of it everywhere. I spent good 10 min cutting them off. When it came out of the washer and dryer it was so wrinkled and straps were so terrible looking, I had to iron the straps and the collar and the rest of the overalls. Not to mention the image showed that the stars have more than one button on each side leading you to believe straps can be adjusted, which is also misleading.\nWILL NOT BUY AGAIN.

I wanted to step a little out of my comfort zone and wear one of these bracelets to add some color into my look.  First off, I was very pleased with the packaging.  It would make a nice gift.  I also closely inspected the workmanship and overall quality.  I was very impressed with both.  I chose the orange and purple with the compass.  I have worn the bracelet a few times already and I have been complimented on it each time.  It is a conversation starter and the compass isn't just for show.  It works.  I am an avid survivalist and pack a go-bag for emergencies, but there are some emergencies that you can't even grab a bag for.  It is nice to know that in a sudden emergency, not only would I have a working compass, but I know I could find use for the rope and solid metal that the bracelet is made of.  I also really like the way it closes.  The metal bolt screws in, so once its on, you don't have to worry about it falling off.

I'm nervous to wear it because I don't want it to stretch and rip even more, or completely rip, revealing that I'm not wearing a bra. it's also a bit smaller than I thought it would be, which I should've seen coming knowing where it was being shipped from. sizes are always smaller. but I'm 5' 120lbs and I ordered a small, though I should've gotten a medium. it fits but is a little uncomfortable in some spots. I knew it would ride up since it's a thong style, but it leaves a little bulge on my lower back (because there is a bit of extra material) and it rides up really bad. the leg holes are also ridiculously high, they go up to the bottom of my waist making it difficult to find a good pairing with it. a nice high rise skirts looks good, but low rise jeans or regular shorts look very funny. even some of my high waisted shorts are not quite high enough. so all in all it was a decent purchase for a cheap price. I just really wish I hadn't received mine with a rip in the shoulder. I don't want to have to wait through the process of sending it back to receive a new one, so I guess I'll have to be extremely cautious when wearing to avoid more tearing (ha ha rhyming is fun)", "summary": "you get what you pay for", "unixReviewTime": 1469145600}

Our kids pajamas always seem to end up fading and piling faster than any other clothing that gets worn just as much (if not more!) than pjs. I am always looking for a better quality pajama to try, and came across Phoebe Cat Girls Pajamas. I thought the crocodile design was cute and not something you see often for little girls.\n\nWhen the set arrived, I like the simple plastic fold-over bag that it came in. It was simple, but clean looking. The pjs were folded nicely inside. At first glance, the fabric was quite soft and the colors vivid. Further inspection yielded more quality workmanship: the crocodile on the front of the shirt is fully embroidered; excellent stitching on the hems; solid colors without any cracking or fading. I also liked that the neckline of the shirt is double stitched on the edges which gives it a classy look.\n\nThe sizing seems spot on for this set. Pajamas are supposed to be worn a bit tighter for safety purposes, and I do not think ordering your childs regular size will be an issue. I got my daughter a 5T and it is a bit big on her as she is currently a 4T but on the tall size. The length is great and she has a bit more room to grow into width and height wise.\n\nThe only aspect of the pajamas that I did not care for as much is the main crocodile design as one of the eyes just doesnt look right. I thought it might have been a flaw, but it is truly just the design of the crocodile (see photo). There is nothing wrong with how the pajamas are made or the design itself, I suppose it is just not my ideal crocodile eye. But, all in all, the crocodile is adorable.\n\nOverall, this is a heavier weight set of pajamas that launders will and fits true to size. The colors and design are vivid and unique. The fabric is soft and comfortable as well. I am glad I ordered this set and my daughter will be getting a lot of use out of these. I might even let my son wear them when he gets older!\n\nI hope that you found my review helpful. I rely on quality reviews to make my purchasing decisions and my goal is to help other customers find what they need. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.\n\n Thanks for reading and happy shopping!", "summary": "Soft, vivid colors and sized right", "unixReviewTime": 1464652800}

Not sure if it was the smiling crocodile with the \"wonky\" eye or just the color, but my granddaughter carried the pajamas around with her the entire first day after receiving them!  And yes, one of the eyes is indeed \"wonky\" but based on the other reviews and even the advertisement pictures, that eye must be purposely made that way. My only complaint and why I only gave 3 stars is because I don't like the fabric -though it is hard to pinpoint why. Although the fabric is soft and made of 100% cotton, it is kind of  stretchy, and reminds me of cheap leggings or t-shirt material. (You know how those \"jersey cotton\" sheets feel? Well these pajamas feel like that to me, and I, personally, am not a fan of them.) Not sure how these will hold up after multiple washings, but since kids tend to outgrow clothing long before it wears out, these should last just fine.

I just wish the shirt is wrinkle free because I hate ironing clothes. It's not too wrinkly after washing and drying it in the dryer but I prefer shirts like this to be as neat as possible so it's really nice if the fabric is one of those wrinkle free and stain resistant fabric.

My daughter is between a 2T and 3T right now, so nothing really fits great.  I ordered this in the 3T thinking it might be a little big, but would give her room to grow.  When she put this on, it fit perfectly!  So, while I think it runs a little small, I would say by no more than half a size.\n\nThe set came in a Ziploc pouch, and I thought the presentation was nice.  I was just expecting them to be loose in the box.  The packaging is see thru, and when I opened the box, my daughter instantly recognized the character and got excited.  The character is screen printed, and looks like it will hold up to the rigors of child use.  My wife opened up the package, and as soon as my daughter saw it she wanted to try them on.  As I mentioned above, the fit was great!\n\nThe material is soft, and warm; perfect for lounging or sleeping in.  My daughter put them on right away, and would not take them off, even for dinner.  I like that there was no tag, so there was nothing to irritate her skin.  She ended up wearing it all night, and then wanted to wear the top to school the next day.  Luckily, we had a clean Rainbow Dash shirt, and I was able to swap them.  The pants are cute, with little hearts all over; personally, I wish they had something related to the character, but no one else seemed to mind.  My wife likes to wash everything before we put it on my daughter, so my only warning would be to make sure you do not open this in front of your child, if you are hoping to wash it first.

So I would recommend buying true to size for what you need and ignoring that recommendation.\n\nIn terms of quality, the stitching is nicely done and reminds me of brands you'd find in a department store.

My daughter loves these! I have just one small issue with them.\n\nPros:\n\n1) super cute! These look exactly like the picture in regards to color, design (cuffs, etc), and the screenprint on the front of the shirt! It is important to note that the dots on the pants are a screenprint like material as well, so there's that if you don't like that feeling, you may not like these! I find it to be just fine, and frankly the pants are adorable!\n\n2) colors don't fade badly after a wash. Frankly we have washed these several times and the fabric has not faded or bled at all. This is a great thing for me as nothing is worse than combining wash only to find grey things have a pink streak in them. No worries with these Pjs. No color bleeding at all.\n\n3) soft! I love the cotton, and so does my daughter. When we opened the package the Pjs actually felt a bit rough, so I worried a bit about it not washing well and softening up. Turns out I was worried about nothing - they really are nice now, and feel very comfortable when on!\n\nCons:\n\n1) the big con for me is that these do shrink quite a bit. when we got them I may have said these run true to size, but after the first wash they did shrink quite a bit, so they should be thought of as running just a bit small. I don't think it is a big deal as long as you note this fact and order a size or two up. Additionally, I would only dry on low heat, which we did and it still shrunk. All in all these are awesome and cute pjs so long as you order up in size and wash and dry on cold/ low heat.\n\nNote: I received this product at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review.", "summary": "AWESOME, but shrink.", "unixReviewTime": 1466294400}

I'm not a big fan of my legs, so I was hoping this would fit me shorter length wise, like a tunic- and it does. So keep in mind- you probably won't want to wear this as a dress by itself because:\n- It is very short (I'm 5'1\" and the slip part comes to only a couple of inches below my underwear line).\n- It rides up a bit because of the slip lining and static/etc.\n\nAs the description states- these are Asian plus sizes. I only order Asian sizes if there are measurements included in the description, and I always make sure to double check the measurements of whomever I'm ordering for as well.  I normally wear a US size 2X, and since my measurements lined up with the 4X measurements listed, I ordered that size.\n\nI was very happy to find out that after I recieved the dress at home, the measurements are spot on with what's in the description. I was also glad to see that there is actually a tag inside the dress with the material make-up AND care instructions listed. They say to hand wash; do not dry clean or tumble dry, and you may use a cool iron.\n\nThe navy lace is very soft, with a royal blue lining that's also soft and light. I was worried that the lace would be uncomfortable or stiff, but it isn't at all.\n\nHere's the problem(s):\n- There is (supposed to be) a button on the back at the nape of the neck, so that when you button it, there is a small keyhole. The button was there when I started writing this review, and even after I tried it on. I didn't even use the button, because I'm by myself and didn't feel like attempting it just to try on. Well, I just looked at the dress again and the button is GONE. I cannot find it anywhere to sew it back on either :(\n- There are a few problems with the stitching- puckering at the bottom of the keyhole detail; loose pieces of the lace fabric hanging off the same area, the hem line in the back and on the side; and loose string hanging off the armpit areas, etc. Looks like I forgot to shave my underarms and the hair's coming through! I will have to trim the excess fabric and strings, but I hate having to do that because I don't want to cut a hole or cut too close to the fabric by accident. Blah...\n- The circles in the lace on the front of the dress are placed poorly. There are 2 huge circles with smaller circles in them sitting RIGHT where my boobs! Yikes. Not very flattering, especially on someone plus size :(", "summary": "More of a tunic (too short to wear alone). Button fell off before even buttoning it :(", "unixReviewTime": 1463443200}

I'm not so sure I can pull it off as a dress due to the length but I think it makes a very fun long trench style jacket and that's how I intend to use it.

The material is a cotton with a bit of a stretch, reminds me of some of my favorite dress shirts from back in the day when I worked full time and no one called me Mom... :)\n\nIf I was going to wear it as a dress it would definitely need a slip.  The material is not thin (it has a nice weight to it) but it is a bit more sheer than I would be comfortable with!  For myself I would consider hemming 4-5 inches off if using as a dress - I am 5'4\" and it makes for a rather long dress on me - with the high waist it would need to be shorter to be flattering.  I love the full skirt on this, no skimping on the material - makes for a great fly away look.\n\nMy one wish?

It does tend to run a little small, but not ridiculously so.\n\nI am really pleased to have this bra! I am a woman who actually has breasts (size C), and have never been able to find a strapless bra that would stay up and allow me to wear cute little tops! I refuse to have my bra showing under my garments, I believe it is not attractive. I have several dresses that have required a strapless bra, and to avoid the constant bra slip, I would put on those clear plastic bra straps - which are miserable. A backless dress was absolutely out of the question. But have have too much to feel comfortable going au- natural.\n\nGetting the bra on takes really no effort. The inside is really really sticky. It's not like \"sticker\" sticky, more like sticky gel. It is ridiculously sticky,though! Unlike other stick on bras I have purchased in the past, this bra does not have non-adhesive spots for your nipples, so it is a bit uncomfortable during removal.\n\nTo apply these, you just peel off the thin plastic covering, stick the bra to one side of your breast, pull it across, and stick it to the side of the other breast. Then pat down. It's that easy. Place it so that they are wide enough apart that your breasts will be a little bit squished together. This gives you a nice cleavage, as well as lift.\n\nWhen I first tried this bra, I figured out how to get the bra on, but not how to get any \"lift\". I figured just having the girls contained was enough, even if I looked a little \"saggy\". But then I discovered that if you place the bra higher on your breasts (like with the bottom part hanging below the bra), you can stick the sides of this bra higher up on your chest, and actually have lift, as well as control. So squeeze them in, and lift them up. I stick and and unstick them a few times (one cup at a time) until I get the girls at just the right height. It is not painful to pull the adhesive off your skin at all.\n\nI wore this bra all day, out in the sun. I sweat a little, was pretty active, and had no problem! You hardly even feel it! Under my shirt, you can't even tell that this is a strapless, backless bra. It just generally looks like I am wearing a normal bra! I am really really impressed!  This bra has thicker padding than I've had on other bras, which some people may appreciate.  I prefer un-padded bras in general, but I'll still wear this one.  The drawstring between the cups is great, because you can squeeze the girls together as much, or as little, as you want.  In reading reviews of other bras, the ones with clips come unhooked, so definitely pick one with a drawstring.\n\nIt does not hurt to pull the bra back off. Just put the plastic back on the adhesive, and store the bra in the reusable bag. I don't know how many uses I will get from the adhesive, but it's not like I need to wear this type of bra every day. It will be totally worth it to replace it when the adhesive wears off! Don't have anything on your skin, like lotion or moisture before you apply this bra.\n\nI give it a 4 stars, because for me, I wish it weren't as padded, had more coverage, and had \"nipple spots\" inside the bra.  Other than that, it is a great bra, and works wonderfully!\n\nI wholeheartedly give this bra an enthusiastic 4 stars. I really like it, and will wear it all the time!", "summary": "Finally!

It was okay though because the bow was really cheap and hard to tie so I ended up buying another belt to match the skirt and cover the elastic waistband. As others have said, the elastic makes the skirt fit more comfortably but it's not cute at all and must be covered. As for the quality, I was pleasantly surprised. The tulle was not cheap and soft and better quality than I expected. The silhouette was just like in the photo - true A-line and fluffy. When it arrived, it was all compact and possibly wrinkly, but I sprayed it with Static Guard and hung it up over night before I needed to wear it and it was perfect. I got so many compliments and I felt darling in it. The color was bright and cheery as I hoped too! I definitely recommend this listing for good quality inexpensive tulle skirts and I myself will be purchasing another color soon.

I cut off 4 inches to allow the curved end to more neatly fit into pant belt loops. Now, however, belt won't latch until I probably attain a size 28-inch waist which ain't going to happen.  In my judgment, curved end is excessively long, at least for my taste.  The solution is for the manufacturer to extend the groves two inches prior to tip of curved end of belt.  As purchased, grooved cuts are a full 5-inches from curved tip end of belt.  Now need to purchase new curved belt sans buckle.  Word to wise.  FYI to all.", "summary": "Careful with cut back in length", "unixReviewTime": 1525305600}

However, when I saw the sizing chart, I immediately felt wary. I am a very short woman at 5\"0, weigh 130 pounds and I normally wear a B cup bra. Why is this information relevant? Because I had to get this top in a XX-Large according to its chart...and I have never gotten any shirt larger than a Medium in my life. Take note that this is the biggest size this company offers for this particular top. Anyway, it took several days to get here, but sooner than the estimated time.\n\nOnce I put on the blouse, I was pleased that the rich wine color was exactly as pictured. The fabric is very nice and smooth to the touch, but I would say it would be way too hot to wear in the summer. Perfect for fall or wintertime, though. One drawback that I noticed is that the shirt felt slightly tight around my shoulders, but it still looked rather flattering for my figure. I think this would look great with dark leggings or skinny jeans, but it would make you look more plump with baggier pants.\n\nSo in conclusion, I think this blouse is worth the price but only if you are on the thin side or don't have a large chest. Otherwise, you will end up disappointed.\n\nI received this product at a discount but this does not affect my review in any way.", "summary": "Lovely blouse...but only for smaller women!", "unixReviewTime": 1464220800}

The possibilities are endless really.\n I was not thinking it would be this luxurious or well made!\nAnd can we talk about the color?!  OMG. It couldn't be a more beautiful color of blue!\n I needed it to match a long dress I'm going to wear.  I. Do. Not. Wear. Dresses.  My standards were low when it came to something, anything to wear with it.  It has several shades of blue and this scarf just makes the dress even more beautiful!\nThe product is so well packaged. It came with a special cloth-like tote, a zip-top plastic bag and a (freebie) beautiful hand-painted porcelain pendant necklace. They seem to have taken a lot of pride in their product.\n\nI was glad to have a chance to purchase this product at a discount in return for me taking the time to write a thorough and honest review.

I ordered the size L going by the sizing chart. I am 5'7\", 155 lbs, a size 12, and bra size 34DD. The \"bra\" portion of this set is made small. There was absolutely no support and the cups were nowhere near big enough to fit my breasts. However, the lacy portion under the bra part was wayyyy too big. It kind of just hung there. It wasn't form fitting at all like in the photo. I suppose ideally I would need an XXL in the breast portion and a M or even a S in the rest of the dress. I think this is just a simple design flaw and that maybe this set isn't made for women with my shape. Not everyone is made the same, so this is definitely understandable. All things considered, this is an absolutely gorgeous set. The embroidery on the lace is absolutely stunning. The amount of detail in the design of this set is simply fantastic. The dress portion has slits that go all the way up to the bust which made this comfortable, sexy, breathable, and very forgiving to the imperfect figure. There is basically nothing to the g-string panty that comes with this set, but I guess that's kind of the point, right? Overall this is a beautiful set, I just wish it were made to fit my figure so I could enjoy it a little more.\n\nI received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

Its pretty thin, so its rather see-through. I see this as an asset, rather than a deterrent; it creates less bulk around the neck.\n\nSpend the extra money for silk scarves, rather than imitations. Silk has a warmth and durability that you don't find with artificial fibers. I wash my silk scarves in a sink of warm water and hair conditioner. Pick a smell you like, it doesnt matter what kind of conditioner. Rinse well, roll in a bath towel to blot out moisture, and hang to dry.

The color is exactly as depicted in the picture. The blouse arrived just as expected, the blouse was a greenish color that can be used for almost any occasion.

Because of the design, it can be worn for either work or regular casual days. It is really elegant looking when worn with a nice cardigan or jacket.

I also try to stay away from slim width ties because I'm a bigger guy(6'4\" 240lbs) and I look funny wearing them. This tie first off is the width that I like to wear it's between the two fits(slim and traditional). It still has somewhat of a classic look to it so you can wear it to a fancy dinner party yet it's stylish enough to wear it casually with a button up and jeans. Another great thing about this tie is that it is made of cotton so it's durable enough to be worn over and over again without having to deal with creases or stains(I haven't had a stain yet, just assuming). I'll probably buy another one from this company in the near future. Thanks Ysiop!\n\nIf this review was helpful to you, please click on the YES button.

I'm really glad I got the XL though since I am wearing it over hoodies. If I was wearing it like a normal person the Large would probably be more than fitting if not the medium even if you're wanting to wear it tight and accentuate your waist. I think how stretchy it is really helps conform to your body.\nAlso for any further reference about fitting like comparing my sizing to yours if we're similar...my bust is 37inches, waist 27, hips 40/41, I usually wear medium size tops from Victoria's Secret and their hoodies in a large(popular store I could think of that most people would be familiar with sizing).\n\nMy picture I show wearing it with a pink hoodie and then I show it with me wearing a red shirt.

They have interest with the layer of leather plus the metal details. Not too much that a guy cannot wear it but more than just a plain band.\n\nAdjustable. It has 2 snaps, which is really nice. It fits my larger framed husband (he is 6'9\") a little snug but still comfortably, as well as my smaller 5'6\" frame. I have quite small wrist and they are a little loose but not enough where the whole bracelet spins.\n\nUnisex. Works for both my husband and myself.\n\nGreat price for a 2 pack of nice bracelets. We like to go to our local Renaissance Faire every year and as soon as I pulled them out my husband said that they look like great Ren Faire attire. I will probably get a second set so each of use can wear a set on both wrists come RenFaire time.

I have a very long torso and can hardly ever find shirts long enough for me. Even buying this in my \"normal size\" was a pleasant surprise because this one fits more like a tunic top. Covered my butt and comes to the very end of the zipper on the front of my jeans. It is slightly fitted in the chest (I wear 34D) but not too tight and very flattering sleeves. I am desperate for more colors! I can't decide what I like more, going up a size for a dress or my normal size to obtain the tunic style!!!

I enjoyed seeing the Made in the USA patch on the packaging. It makes me happy to support an American-made, created, and/or distributed product.\nThe packaging is so nice and professional. When my mom came over and visited, she saw the product sitting on my dresser, in the closet of my master bedroom, and she thought that I had spent hundreds of dollars at the high-end stores buying the most expensive clothing and accessory products. She was so surprised when I told her that I had received a very good deal on Amazon! Shopping through Amazon, especially having a Prime membership, is really a good deal.\n\nPRO: The product came as described. The packaging is very nice and professional. It looks like something I could have bought at a high-end store. The product is wrapped nicely in a bag to keep it from getting wet or torn during the shipping process. The bag, itself, does not have that bad, musty smell that some products have that I have bought off some competing sellers on Amazon.\nI love the company and brand because they are made in the USA, which is very important to me, because then I know that the product is of the highest quality). I did not need to contact the seller because there were no issues with the purchasing of the product, the shipment time, the price, or the products end results. I would highly recommend this item to my friends and family. If you are torn between buying this and another similar product, please purchase this one, regardless of the price point difference. The clothing and accessories can be worn during the day, while I am a teacher, and at night, when I go out with my friends.\n\nCON: The product is not a named brand, so if using a product with a known name that is important to you, then perhaps this product is not for you. I know that some people get hung-up on name brands and it prevents them from getting out of their proverbial comfort zone and trying new things that they might enjoy. Personally, receiving and trying a product that has not been tried by my friends is a new concept to me, but I am an adventurous person who likes to try new things, like traveling solo around western and eastern Europe, moving to South Korea without knowing any of the language, culture, or people. So buying a product that has a brand name that I have never heard of, that none of my friends have ever used, and I have not seen on a store rack, might scare some people, but it does not bother me.\n\nSUMMARY: I have been wearing similar products for over 10 years, since I was a teenager and I realized that I needed to wear high-quality clothing and accessories on my body. I have been searching for this similar type of product for a while. I would say that this product ranks right up there with products at two, three, or four times the price. I would recommend this product to my friends, family, coworkers, and you! Thanks for reading! Please note that I received the product for free or at a discount, however my reviews are my own words.", "summary": "Exactly as Described; Helps Organize My Purse", "unixReviewTime": 1463443200}

The package arrived and it was in an envelope, which was fine I like the fact that they did not over do the packaging. I received the product within 2 days of ordering. It is sheer with embellishments on the neckline and tassels at the bottom. It does not come close to being able to close in the front, but it is functional. She did not like it so much as a cover up for the beach, she likes to wear it with jeans, skirts, shorts and dresses. It is a very versatile piece. The material is polyester, its sheer and very breathable, so its great on hot days. The material is strong, my daughter actually got it caught on a door handle while walking out of our home and it did not tear, which I was surprised since it does seem like a delicate piece. This is a beautiful must have for your wardrobe, but even though it says one size it is truly a small. My daughter is very tall and thin and it fits her perfectly. I think the verbiage for one size should be changed and it should be listed as just small, I think the one size is a bit misleading. I would recommend this product, it is beautiful, quality made, strong material. A tip, we washed this by hand, and flat dried to prevent any tangling of the tassels and to avoid any issues with shrinkage.\nIf after reading my review of this product or any of my other reviews and interesting or useful please rate it is as \"helpful\" or leave a comment.

Our vacation by the beach house was already set and she already started procuring stuff which she needs for this vacation.  When she saw this cardigan, she said this will be perfect for that.  Also, she said this will actually have many usage, not just one time on the beach but she can also use this for casual outfits or everyday wear.  The cardigan's picture here online looked very lovely and when we got this for real, it looked just the same. My wife totally loved it!  This is a lightweight fabric but a durable material.  I am pretty sure that this will be serving her for a long time, which is really nice.  She already used this several times and had been washed and dried in the machines several times as well, and the good thing was that there were no wearing or tearing whatsoever.  The color also did not fade.  Plus points to all of its nice features. It is not that wrinkly as well as long as you get it out of the dryer the moment it is done.  Well, even though this may be lightweight, it does serve its purpose of blocking that hot rays of the sun giving you the protection you need.  It does not only block the heat but also the light cool windy breeze during spring time.  This is a multi-functional cardigan. The design was also pretty.  The tassels added more attractiveness to it.

It is a plated ring so take if off before washing your hands and things like that. Also since it is so elaborate it has some corners where it could snag on things.

The leather material looks clean and has a nice feel, not hard and inflexible, but not too soft and flimsy either.\nOther wallets boast of their \"slim\" feature, but they're really only slim when empty tend to bulk up as cards and cash are added. What I appreciate most about this Ikepod is that it stays in its \"slim\" genre even when cash and cards are added. It almost seems as if its unable to get big :) . I think it's the way the wallet is designed combined with the texture of the leather material. And by maintaining its slim feature, it's also a very comfortable \"front pocket wallet\". Fair price for a very well made wallet. Good job Ikepod.\nAddition: I strongly suggest that Ikepod increase the color selection on this wallet.

The length was the perfect length to fit around her neck comfortably. The clasp is gold toned & has a lobster claw clasp, if need you could easily add extra chain or rings to lengthen it no problem.

Don't go by Amazon size chart link, if you are not sure about your size, please choose one size up. This was a bit small for me even though I ordered a size up, needs to be more forgiving in the hips. I think if you have curves it would run small.  The pleats at the waist add a touch of style and class to the dress, followed by a flattering neckline and slit in the front. I chose classic black only because I was not sure on the neckline being too low; I was afraid I would have to wear something underneath. However, it fit fine in the breast area, and I am topheavy at a 44DD.\nAs for cleaning it states: Hand wash or machine wash is OK. Hand wash is recommended for long lasting quality. I machine washed mine on delicate cycle and didn't have any problems with color fading or threads coming unraveled. It remained in tact and did not shrink. I then let it air dry on a hanger.\n\nOverall, I am highly pleased with this product, and I do highly recommend it. For its pricing, and durability you will not find a similar product for cheaper.

The springs are strong enough to ensure that they are well fitting and snug.  The designs and paint that is a part of the designs are pretty solid and of high quality.  The back side of the clip is a little off center on two of them - but still within the overall frame of the bar itself so it doesn't compromise the ability of the bar to work properly.\n\nAs for packaging - they come is a nice box - but unfortunately they come 'loose' within the box - so while it's nice-ish, i still wouldn't use it as a gift box.  That being said the clip bars are nice enough to offer as a gift to workmates and family.\n\nFinal summary then - they work well and offer variety when you need to use a tie.", "summary": "Good value for a nice set of tie clip bars.", "unixReviewTime": 1470009600}

I like the fact that there is no wire in the bra area, and that it is a huge area to keep the bosom pushed up.  The suit fits extremely well, which I was surprised.  Its made of 87% polyester and 13% spandex.  I am used to wearing pretty much all spandex, so I don't know how well the suit will hold up in chlorine for a summer season, or throughout the year as I regularly go to an aerobics aquatic class.\nThere are a few things that I don't like about the suit.  For one, after I put it on the first time, the elastic in the shoulder straps became twisted, and I cant seem to untwist them.  Also, there are a lot of loose threads, and the inner seam in one section came undone on the side.  This was only after trying it on one time.  I cant imagine how it will hold up with wearing it on a continual basis.  I will probably not wear it in the pool on a regular basic, but will wear it at the beach as I don't usually go in the water.  Please take a look at the closeup detail picture I took of these issues.\nPros~  great color, fits well, keeps the bosom pushed up, no wire.\nCons ~ elastic straps are twisted, loose threads, and part of the seam has separated.\nDisclaimer I did receive this item at a discount for my testing and honest unbiased review.", "summary": "I'm a pinup!!", "unixReviewTime": 1468540800}

The color is a stunning color of blue.  I really like how the straps are thick.  I have had one piece bathing suits with skinny straps and they were cute but now I have seen these I think I prefer the thick ones.  The  suit looks old fashioned if you will to me which I love.  I got size 2XL because that is what I normally wear but when I tried it on it was a little tough to put on,  I went back to look at the size chart and my hips are a little bit bigger than the measurements which is a complete bummer.  That is my only complaint which was my fault for not looking before buying.  It is well made and has a push up padded bra to hide nipple popich lol  I love the fact that the bathing suit does a full circle and doesn't dip in the back like a lot of suits do for a more sexier look I guess.  It helps to hide some unwanted skin to show.  Overall I'm pleased with this suit.

Your product is a perfect fit, and your sizing chart is as accurate as they come.\nThe socks themselves fit snugly, are very comfortable and the non-slip heel material makes them even more durable when worn, meaning you don't have to be concerned with the socks sliding, stretching or becoming visible when worn with low cut slip-on shoes.\nIn a nutshell, you have an excellent, well made, thought provocative product and I would highly recommend it to anyone/everyone.

This is the product you want ... Trust me.\n\nIf it helps you, here's what I learned prior to this purchase.\n\n1. For most brands, no matter what the packaging says: \"One size fits all\" is simply NOT true when it comes to no-show socks. Even if they fit when you first try them on, you can expect that some brands will shrink after washing, pretty much rendering them useless if you have a large foot. I like this product because you can buy them in different sizes, ensuring you get something that fits. I purchased the large \"extra coverage\" for my size 11 foot. They fit just right after washing, and are still truly no-show.\n\n2. If you have a large foot (size 10.5 or larger) don't even bother buying socks that don't have a silicone grip inside the heel. If you buy the \"one size fits all\" no-show socks without silicone, you will quickly find that the socks will not stay on your heel and will get bunched up under your feet inside the toes of your shoes (forcing you to repeatedly take of your shoes to put your socks back on.) Not only does this product have silicone, but it has a noticeable, sizable amount, ensuring your socks stay on. (Other socks that have silicone just have 2-3 wavy lines of gripping material, but this has a large-sized oval on the heel, ensuring grip.) See pic.\n\n3. Check whether the elastic in the openings are round or flat! The sock opening (where your feet go) on most no-show socks is made with some type of elastic band. If that band is round in shape, you may find that the sock will cut into your feet over time when your shoes are on, possibly even cutting off circulation if you have veins that show easily. Make sure you get socks with a flattened elastic band to minimize this feeling.\n\n4. Not all socks are truly no-show. Regardless of what the packaging says, the best no-show socks are ones that are cut below the ankle, not on it or above it. If the socks you're considering appear to have material on an ankle, you can expect not to like how they'll look when wearing your boat shoes or driving moccasins. These socks are truly no-show ... unseen, yet still functional.\n\nI wish I had known about this brand of socks before, but at least now I know. Learn from my trial/error ... Large-footed men: buy these if looking for no-show socks.", "summary": "Large-footed men: Stop searching. This is the no-show sock you want.

This bag isn't for everyone for sure, it's more for those with some retro styles. The canvas material is very good and it does come with a shoulder strap. There is no padding on the shoulder strap in case anyone was wondering.\n\nThere is the interesting front flap zippered storage. It has 2 zippers so that you can unzip in either direction and its best to unzip it when the bag is laying on its back, cause you don't' want to unzip it while holding it, items inside will fall straight down. There is also the main zippered compartment and inside has 2 additional small zippered pockets for smaller items. Finally in the back there is a small zippered pocket for like keys or a small size phone.\n\nOverall it's a bag that has it's own unique style and works best for individuals with similar style. I did however find that the main zippered compartment tends to not zip properly. Sometimes when you think you zipped it closed, you are actually unzipping it, as you can see in my video.\n\nI have attached some Image / Video, it might not show up right away. Amazon has since change the way how they process these and when it will show up on the reviews. Please be patience. Thank You.\n\nA free sample was provided for this evaluation.", "summary": "Good canvas material, Very large main compartment storage, Interesting front flap zipper storage.", "unixReviewTime": 1469318400}

It's more of a weekend bag than a book or school bag. The materials are for sure inferior and cheap. Zippers wouldn't run right straight out of the package the day it arrived.

I can't imagine trying to stuff this bag full only to be met with lining and stitching  ripping out, zippers breaking, and crossbody strap breaking off the caribiner clips. The \"leather\" accents on the bag are a joke. More like brown felt made to look like leather. In fact brown felt probably would have looked better. The \"red\" color is a deep purple icky color. There are three slip pockets inside and two outside zip pockets. Larger is the \"duck bill\" pocket on the front with a smaller zip on the backside. The larger slip pocket inside could hold your cell phone, the two smaller inside only owns and pencils one each. The larger zip compartment inside could hold my kindle voyage about 6\"x4\" and the smaller inside zip is for change or cash.  As for the flap pocket on the front I'm mystified to what purpose it serves. It's this big long flap which opens up into a very small pocket on the out side of the bag. Looks like an ugly duck bill.

It's closest to the Swim365 cover up I can find, but only because I don't have any other choice. I'm not crazy about it but I am home 24/7 and have to be comfortable and have at least one pocket.\n\nI hope this helps and I hope one day Swim365 will start making their two-pocket cover ups again so we can get them from Woman Within once again.

I looked around on Amazon for a shirt that was thin and breathable enough to work for our needs. I was initially wary of purchasing this shirt due to the mixed reviews; it was difficult to tell which size my fianc would need because the customer reviews and size chart seemed to differ quite a bit. I took a chance and ordered the XXXL in black (which seems kind of crazy because he wears a medium in US sizes) and held my breath when he tried it on.\n\nWhat do you know? It fit just the way he wanted it to and the material was perfectly lightweight and airy. He was pretty thrilled with the outcome, regardless of the fact that the tag reading \"XXXL\" made him \"feel fat\" (such a joker), and we're both very happy with how the pictures turned out. I think it's pretty safe to say that he was comfortable throughout the entire photo shoot while I was adjusting my hair, fixing my dress, wiping sweat off of my upper lip, etc. Sometimes guys have it so good.\n\nOverall, this was a great purchase for the price and quality. Dress shirts can be crazy expensive, and considering the amount of use this one will likely get on date nights, work functions and photo shoots, it has basically already paid for itself. We've also ordered the light blue color in the same size and he wears it to work every week. Can't go wrong with this purchase!", "summary": "Strange Sizing; Great Shirt", "unixReviewTime": 1499817600}

This swimwear fitted her perfectly. It snuggled her petite body so nicely.  She said that it is very much comfortable to be worn.  I love how she looked in it,the swimsuit and her is like a perfect combination - both are very attractive.  She like the spandex material as it is lightweight even when it gets wet when swimming and at the same time it will also dry faster.

I despise wearing ankle socks when I am wearing boots because they always slide down the heel of my foot and I am constantly having to readjust/ pull them up but I had no problems with these socks! They stayed put all day, even when I was walking to/ from class, did not need to readjust at all!!

I received this product at a discount for my honest review that is my own feeling on this product and may or may-not be the same as yours. I will only leave an honest review no matter if I receive a discount or not. I will update my reviews to add or subtract stars if the product changes during use.  The way that I review varies with each item.  Some have so many great things that it is easy to go on and on about all of the positive things.  Others only have enough to state that they are bad.  If a review is too long people stop reading it so what is the point.  My Stars also depend on how I I like/dislike the product on my own personal level. I may also list a product as 3 stars even though I didn't like it as it may be a good product in itself for someone else.  Just because it didn't work exactly the way I wanted it to doesn't mean that it is a bad product all around.  I hope that makes sense.  I also may list something as a 5 star only to come back after a a time to update how the product is and lower the stars.

They are actually very comfortable and almost feel like you have nothing on your feet.  They allow your toes to breathe and that is good especially during the summer.  There was only one thing that I did not like, the smell on the socks.  Not sure if it was from the packaging or not but I did have to wash them to get the smell out.  Otherwise they are great socks, very low profile allowing you to wear them with various different shoes.

They are all lace including the back. The back is a sports bra style and there are no hooks. The shoulder straps are lace as well and have some elasticity to them. The straps are not adjustable. The cup area is lined on the underside with a cotton material. That is the only \"padding\" if you even want to call it that. It's not thicker like padding so I would say it a lining. These do have underwire in them.\n\nThese are a very pretty style and have a nice look when on. My daughter wears a 38C bra and I ordered the XL for her and they fit her around the back and in the cup area. The shoulder straps worked good for her too and do not slide down on her. Over many times of wearing, I could see that the straps may possible stretch out but if that happens I will be sure to update this for you to let you know.\n\nSeeing how these looked on her and being a C cup, I don't think these would fit a larger size breast. These don't have much support even though they are underwire. I think it's due to them being all lace. My daughter said they are comfortable but she almost feels like when she bends over she's gonna slip out of the cup area.\n\nThe only issue I noticed with these as far as quality goes is the straps. There are some threads/fuzz on the side of all the straps (I show this in my video). I think it's just because of them being lace because it's not like they are falling apart or unraveling or anything. Overall, they are a pretty style and a decent quality. Definitely not a VS quality but I wasn't expecting that when I ordered them.\nI received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.", "summary": "Cute Bras!

The large fits well, it covers my entire top half and hangs comfortably over the top of my pants (no accidental crop top). The back has the same dramatic low cut as shown. The armpits are cut a little awkward, there is some gapping, but nothing terrible. I would definitely want to wear a bra with this top and would probably opt to wear a bandeau over it to hide the straps. It is made of a cotton material, similar to a regular t-shirt blend. The material is a little stiff, like a new shirt, which doesn't help the gapping up top. Hopefully it softens up after a few times through the wash.

I wanted to go alone, without my 3 kids, but with how busy I know I'll be over the next week I knew I wasn't going to have the time. Like many women, I dread swimsuit shopping. Things just never seem to fit well or look as flattering as you want them to be. I was nervous shopping for a swimsuit on Amazon, but I decided to try it. To be safe, I perused the swimsuits, saved my favorites and narrowed it down to 5 suits that had a return policy and ordered those, hoping to find at least 1, maybe 2 keepers.\n\nA little about me: I'm 5'8.5\", weigh 155 pounds and wearing 36C bra. I have a straight figure, not much in curves. I don't have my waist and hip measurements, but I do know my waist is only about 3-4\" smaller than my hips, definitely not curvy. I typically wear either an 8 or 10 in pants and a XS or S in tops and I have an average length torso. As I mentioned above, I have 3 children, all birthed by me, so I have earned my stripes on my stomach and that excess pooch from pregnancy, something I prefer covering up. When swimsuit shopping, I look for a 1-piece that covers up my belly region and that has some support and padding in the chest area as it doesn't take much to flatten me out.\n\nThe suit (I ordered one in red and one in light blue to try on)\nPros: Both colors of this suit that I purchased are very pretty. As stated above I look for a suit that helps cover up my stomach area and masks my pooch as well as enhance my chest and not flatten me out. The picture of this suit looked like it would do both. The chest area of this suit is great. With the crisscross of the material and the molded cups inside it did fit well in the chest area. I did like how it looked on the upper part of my body.\n\nCons: Normally the ruching, like what is shown on this suit, helps with covering up the pooch in my stomach area. However the material of this swimsuit seems thinner than other suits I tried on. Also, which I ordered the size recommended for my normal clothing size, this suit felt a little loose on me. Because of those 2 reasons, this suit did not smooth out my stomach region. Actually, as shown in my side view, I can even see some \"excess\" on my back that just isn't as flattering. The other suits I tried on kept my back looking smooth....at least when posing for my pictures. Despite the suit being a little big, I felt like going down a size wouldn't have helped much because of how thin the material was and because the material didn't seem as stretchy as other suit material that typically helps smooth out the figure. Another downside with the suit was the suits seemed designed for a long torso. I had bagginess in the crotch area, not attractive at all. Again, I don't think going down a size would have helped as it was really loose compared to the rest of the fit. And pulling it up on top and tying the straps tighter didn't help because then it pulled the chest up too high and I was hanging out below the cups. I knew once you got the suit wet, the bagginess in the crotch area would be worse as wet material hangs lower than dry! Not something I want to deal with on a public beach.\n\nThere were just too many cons for me to consider keeping either of these suits. The price, the colors and the fit in the chest area were great, but the thinness and lack of stretchiness in the material and the loose fit overall just made this a no for me. The only person I would recommend this for is people that have a long torso and have a hard time finding a 1-piece suit that actually fits in length.\n\nIf you would like to read my other swimsuit reviews, I believe if you click on my name you can view other reviews.", "summary": "Pretty colors, but that was about it for this suit!", "unixReviewTime": 1470614400}

I'm 5'10 and roughly 140 lbs, and usually purchase a US medium. I typically wear a larger small to a medium.

The looseness was primarily a the top, with a bit more form fitting in the waist.  I would suggest if you are between sizes, or on the verge of the next size up, to opt for the larger size.\n\nThe sleeve detail was nice, with the open cut and ties, but it was closed enough at the top to make this okay for work (hiding bra straps, mainly). The top is a relatively thick mostly polyester material, with a bit of stretch to it. For a polyester, it had some weight to it and was a bit heavy--I could see this being not so breathable feeling on a hot day, but the loose fit should make it so that it would still feel comfortable. It wasn't stiff, though, and had nice movement.\n\nI washed this on delicate and hung to dry with no issues--no shrinking, bleeding of color, or fading. The colors are bright and vibrant, and very solid. Very true colors with no faded look--the color is as solid in one spot as it is in the other. It also dried very nicely, with zero need to iron (no wrinkles or creases)\n\nOverall, very solid and very cute top. The detail is fun and it's a unique top. Easy wash and wear.

The arms are super short but the leg area is more like long shorts.  We live in the desert so that isn't a big deal to us but anywhere else and I can see it being an issue.  The fabric, even after washing, isn't super soft but did soften a little bit.  The snap closure is nice because it provides easy access for diaper changes and the like.  It did have a smell to it when it first arrived but I just left it sitting in the empty laundry basket for a few extra days and the smell disappeared after the first wash. It seemed to shrink a little after washing the first time as well.  I am only giving this three stars because I feel that the cut is a bit odd and the smell should never have been there.

Ill start with the short, they are very nice with a stretchy waist band. They have a very nice lace pattern on the front, with the design of Flowers and lines. There is also lace on the sides of these sleep shorts. The feel of them on me is nice, it doesnt stick to my skin, or get to hot that I cant sleep.\nThe Cami Top is really pretty, and has the same lace design as the shorts. The lace is underneath the breast area, and there is not backing to it. Just the lace which is see through. This top also has adjustable shoulder straps to make sure you get the fit you want, for sleeping. The top has elastic around the back of it, however, it does not stretch near as much as the shorts do. This top falls right about the waist area in length, and isn't tight as all. Its more of a floating, flowing top, that allows you to move freely and breath. Im a big girl, and I say that because I cant stand to have clothes tight on me. I like to have clothes that fit loose, and allow some room to be comfortable. This set is perfect for that.\nI think this would make a great Birthday Gift, or Holiday Gift for any female.

I actually like the dress, even though I'm going to have to find my own belt and have it altered.

It's always a hit or miss with things from China but this is definitely a huge miss. Like every single reviewer has stated, it is completely sheer and thin. The quality is bad; there are loose threads all over and the hem is the most f***ed up hem I ever saw someone try to sell. I barely know how to sew and I'm pretty sure I can do a better job than that. There's a gap around the smocked waist section that I think they tried to salvage by adding the tassels? Even if you tie it there's still awkward gaps showing skin. Ugh I wanted to like this so badly that I gave it 2 stars when I started writing, but as I continue to write this I have to be honest and say I hate it. The only redeeming quality is that it is chiffon (super thin chiffon) and the little buttons down the front are cute.

And the closures for the buttons gap open pretty bad, especially in the chest area, so Ill need a lacy cami perhaps so I can leave the top unbuttoned.  A belt is needed with this dress as well because there is no button on the elastic waist part where it ties and it gaps open.

It did come in a thick plastic bag, all folded up.  I read the other reviews stating how the hat came all bent up, and how they had issues trying to shape the hat.  I was a little leary of purchasing, as i didn't want to be the one, who couldn't get it to shape correctly.  Especailly, when i want to take it with me, on an up-coming vacation.  I opened the package, and started pressing, pulling and bending the material, to shape it.  All of the bends didn't come out right away.  I placed a t-shirt in the head part of the hat, and laid the hat on a flat surface, for a few days.  Most of the fold marks have gone away on the brim part, and the fold marks in the head part are gone too.  Any other shaping, will be done automatically, once you wear the hat a time or two.  The thickness of the hat, is of quality, and not a flimsy type.  It offers a string inside, to keep the hat from blowing off your head, when windy.  I can't wait to wear this on vacation.  I put the hat on, with my oversized sunglasses.  I looked like a \"Super Star!\" Yes, i just had a vein moment.  Overall, i really like the hat. I would have given the hat 5 stars, if it weren't for the reshaping.", "summary": "After A Little Reshaping, You'll Have A Great Hat", "unixReviewTime": 1520640000}

Its much\ncuter in person than it is in the photos.  The wide range of\ncolors make this top very versatile.  It can pare with just\nabout any color pants, skirts or shorts.\n\nThis is an adorable racer back tank. Its perfect for the  hot\nsummer month.  You are sure to look and stay cool\nin this fashionable top.  It is made from a light weight polyester\nfabric.  It is very soft against the skin.  The color and pattern\nare lively in rich jewel tones.\n\nThe shape of this top is so flattering.  It features a low\ntank style neckline, racer back and high low hem.\n(longer in the back to cover the bootie) Because the\nneckline is so low and the armholes are so large, it\nis best to wear this over a cami or sports bra.\n\nSizing for me was what I expected. I typically wear a\nsize 6 and the medium fit perfectly.  I have a small\nwaist but have large hips.  This top worked fine with\nmy pear shape.  In fact, because of the high\nlow hem and decorative trim, it was very figure flattering\nto my body shape.\n\nThis is a really cute summer top.  It literally goes with every\nthing and looks great.  I will be getting a lot of use from this\none piece of clothing.\n\nThank you for checking out my review.  I hope the information I have\ngiven has been helpful to you.\nI received this item complementary for a fair and unbiased\nevaluation.  This review is my honest opinion based on the item\nI received.  Clothing is an objective item.  No two people are\nexactly the same size and shape.

The pros are that it does look unique looking in the photograph, the straps/bands that bind the wrist don't feel as if they will fall off at the first wear.  In fact, the band does have a secure magnetic broad clasp that should hold.  In fact, the magnet is tad too strong to try and remove one handed, but doable.\n\nThe problem I have with the item is two fold.  1) the feathers on my bracelet don't look as lush as those posted in the photograph.  I purchased the black feather bracelet.  What I mean is because the feathers were so thin, they should have been twice as many feathers used then what I received.  Or perhaps a different type of feather around the band should have been used to make the feather \"band\" look more full and lush.  2) the second issue I had is the band is extremely tiny.  I've never thought of myself as having large wrists but I was afraid that at first that I wasn't going to be able to fit the bracelet on wrist.  The bracelet needs to be clasped just above your hand, as shown in the photo for it to close.\n\nWhich brings me to my final point.  I although I don't feel that the feathers are plentiful enough, the feathers that are used do provide some give.  Since the feathers will be brushing the top of your hand and is on your wrist they shouldn't tear as easily because your forcing them to bend every time you bend your wrist or rotate your hand.  The magnet should certainly stand up to such movement also.\n\nSo to summarize all my thoughts on this bracelet.  The three bands are actually attractive and well secured with a magnet (I have yet to try it on for more than a couple of minutes).  I don't love the feathers that are used or think them plentiful enough; but they work well enough for where you are forced to wear the bracelet.  All in all, if you don't mind these minor issues, as long as the feathers don't fall out the bracelet should be well worth the money.", "summary": "It's a pretty decent bracelt; however I do have some issues with the feathers", "unixReviewTime": 1474416000}

The suspenders were extra long on my son, but since there were two buttons I can simply move a button up and adjust that. Also you can take the suspenders off completely if you wanted.

That being said, the outter pocket makes up for it. The adjustable strap makes for easy cross-body wear when you wanna go hands-free. Nicely constructed and the hardware is sturdy.

You don't see any odd strings sticking out as you normally do on the cheap Chinese clothes that you get online. Every stitch is perfectly sewn.\n\nThe only downside is that unlike most swim suits, you cannot remove the padding from the bra. I personally hate these things especially on a swim suit.

I have a 34C bust and the top fit around my rib cage just fine and clasped comfortably in the back but the cups were too small for my breast so I was spilling out on the top. I am happy to still be able to wear the bottoms because I can match them with other tops I already have and they will go well together  (that's why I chose the black ones).\n\nThe only thing I noticed is when I had the top on the front was nice and black but because the sides stretched to clasp in the back the material looked lighter. I thought it was a different color altogether (grayish) but my husband pointed out that it was just because it was stretched so the color was thinner. Not a problem in the material or the quality it's just one of those things that would bother me.

For added volume you could wear a petticoat underneath but it looks just fine without it as well.\n\nI wasn't sure about the band across the bust/chest (cutout) at first but it really adds to the look. The zipper on the back is barely visible and the cap sleeves don't constrict my arms. Perfect for any semi-formal event, you can easily dress it up or down. I wore this dress to Sunday brunch and it was a hit.\n\nI value honest & informative reviews by other Amazon buyers to help me make informed buying decisions and hope this review helps you.

However, I did experience some boob spillage from the bottom of the swim top, as the bottom of the cup was not secure against my body. I think if I could adjust the bottom strap, the cup would be tighter and would have helped the cup be more secure against my chest to prevent lower boob spillage.\n\nThe bottoms are nice too. I like that they are more conservative than other bottoms, while still being fun and flirty. You can tighten the bottoms using the strings on the side.

Its pretty easy to put on and you can also adjust the straps to get the perfect fit for your neck. The embellishments are intricate and dazzling without being too tacky. It really dresses up the bowtie.  Its pretty lightweight even with all the embellishments on it but it does droop a bit when you put it on. None of the embellishments has fallen off yet so its pretty secure.

Didn't know what to expect buying a blend. However, they're very nice and about as soft. The sizing recommendations are correct for a normal figure. I'm a bodybuilder with a 32\" weast in season and 34\" weast the rest of the year. Also, I've larger than normal butt/glutes, so I went up 1 size. The XL is just right for my 32-34\" weast so go with the recommendation. Now the only thing I'll caution you on is the length is shorter than pictured. On my muscular body type that's expected so that might not be the case for all. Nevertheless, I find these to be as good as described and I'll be ordering more. FYI, the 5 pair I got all fit, look, and feel the same. There are a lot underwear/underpants to choose from.

The shirt states WASH SEPARATELY PROFESSIONAL DRY CLEAN RECOMMENDED but there was no way I would wash this alone nor have done professionally. So as I would all his items, it was thrown in the wash with all his other clothes, washed on cold and dried on low. It shrank very little and came out great. Not that I recommend you follow me but just in case you were curious.\n\nThe shorts contain patches that are not a part of the fabric but sewn on.

There are three in a package and they are so beautiful youll want to wear your hair in a ponytail every day.  They are made of 100% cotton and woven with beads and resin seeds.  Each one has a really tight elastic band.  Some have two elastic bands for double security to not only hold your hair but also secure the stunning design on the front.  The back of the applique has a leather/suede to protect your hair from pulling when you take the ponytail holder out from your hair.\n\nYou get three:  one has a single line of silver crystals ranging in size with one elastic holder.  One has green and silver crystals with silver resin beads in a design that reminds me of a Native American symbol sitting atop of beige suede leather backing and two elastic holders (my personal fav).  The other one has three lines of peach green and brown seed beads surrounding by shiny silver resin seeds with two elastic holders.\n\nThese are so well made and don't tangle your hair when you take them out.  I have thin hair and have to double or triple them to get them stay in my hair and they still look amazing.  They just shine and give your simple hairdo an elegant look.\n\nI would definitely recommend this stunning high quality product.\n\nI will update my review if I deem it necessary. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I hope you find this review helpful and happy Amazon shopping.", "summary": "Makes a simple hairdo look elegant", "unixReviewTime": 1468627200}

You can easily dress up or down with it. I think it would be flattering to any hair style, or hair color. So far I've only worn it casually, only because I had no wear dressy to wear it to. I was in a wedding the before I got this, and I would have loved to wear it then as well. Little hair accents like this are such a nice fun touch to any outfit.\n\nI think the picture the headband appears more gold, than in person. In person it feels more brownish/ tan... That could also be the lighting on my computer or something, and it does still have gold accents. Still I think it's very cute and stylish, and would easily match so many outfit options.\nAs for when the fit question is asked, I really can't answer that because it could fit anyone, it ties in the back so it will easily fit anyone. It even has cute end details. I also like the material used because it feels like it won't hurt or damage my hair, like I've seen others do in the past\nDisclaimer; I did recieve this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.

However the way it is made I can also use the same headband. The headband does not have elastic it is one long piece and you tie it as small or large ad you need/want. This makes doing different hairstyles with it super easy. This also gives you the option of using it yourself or having someone younger use it without it being too tight or too loose on thier heads. With the regular run of the mill bands, which are made with an elastic in the back to keep the band on place, you don't have the option of having younger kids use them if they are made for adults and vice versa. The band has little circles as a design wrapped around the front. The \"string\" part of the headband that you tie has small decorative fringes that give it an added elegance and fashionable style. You can dress it down with a more casual clothing (jeans and shirts) or make it more dressy with skirts, blouses or dresses. My daughter and I both are absolutely in love with this headband. As you can see in the pictures she loves to wear it lower on her forehead. I myself like to wear it higher up like a traditional headband. Any way you wear it it looks absolutely beautiful. If your wondering if it stays tied or comes lose after you put it on. Once tied it stays tied. I have tied the back into a bow as well as just a single knot. If you want to fell more secure you can always double knot it but I don't feel that it is necessary to do so. I know we will get lots of wear out of this head band.

The reviews and not being knowledgeable of the brand made me think the sizes were most likely one size up from the actual feel. I assumed an XL would really fit like a large on me (5\"11, 180, slim).

The shape of this bra fits more naturally to a womans \"natural\" breast shape.

In my opinion this sticky bra wore much better also, it stayed sticky for longer and I didn't struggle with having to constantly fix it. The reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because if you don't have the placement correct it creates a \"fold\" in your breasts, the stickiness started to wear off after 2 uses, and because this bra will start to fall off if you start sweating in the slightest.

Although it is obviously not real leather, the feel is nice. It has a more rigid feel than leather, but for a clutch wallet, that's actually better so you don't wear it out quickly. On the inside, there are many pockets and crevices for you to store all the things that you would in a normal clutch wallet. There simply is nothing to gripe about - since it is less than $40, you cannot gripe about that is it not real leather. But the aesthetics make up for any shortcomings, and if you have an outfit that needs this to complement, then you will not be disappointed.

(I'm 5'5\", 130 lb)\nShould've ordered my normal size 6...or even a 4.  The dress is large on me, sliding off one shoulder or the other; nearly dragging the ground. The material is somewhat shiny; a \"pattern\" like linen, but you know it's not ... rather like cheap sheer curtain material.  It's a double layer of fabric though, so the dress isn't see through. The fabric also snags rather easily. All that being said, it's cool (even with the 3/4 sleeves), comfortable and perfect for what I bought it for...lounging and light yard/garden work.  If I had bought the proper size, it would work for casual wear outside the home as well.

I weigh 130 not so fit pounds and my arms are slender for an old woman so the armholes are perfect, not too tight. I'm 5'4\" and the dress comes mid calf, perfect for my tastes.  It is nice wrinkled or ironed. I prefer a little ironing.  Hope these details help someone. The first dress I ordered was larger. It was too big, but I had no trouble returning it for a refund and return postage was paid by Amazon. That's why I love shopping with them. Fast delivery too.\nAfter reading reviews I see people had trouble after washing. These are delicate fabrics and should be washed by hand. We oldtimers understand taking care of clothing, unlike synthetics that can be thrown in the washer. It's very easy to launder by hand. Just a suggestion if you want it to hold up.", "summary": "This is a beautiful dress. It's light", "unixReviewTime": 1494979200}
