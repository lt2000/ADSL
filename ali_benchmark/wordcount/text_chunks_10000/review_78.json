I wanted a suit to minimize the need for applying and reapplying sunblock on my 8 month baby this summer. My baby is fairly large for his age (about 30 inch height, 21 pounds at 8 months), so I ordered a 12-18 month suite. I am very happy with the size. While the arms are long for him due to sizing up, I simply fold the sleeves at the cuff once. The legs provide full coverage to ankles and the suite is nice and roomy. The material is breathable and quickly dries. I also love the zipper along the seam of legs, as it allows quick diaper access. The zipper from the collar also allows easy changing, even when the suite is wet.", "summary": "Great swim suit for full sun coverage", "unixReviewTime": 1468281600}

I get more of a muffin top from my underwear!\nIf you think you can't wear these if you're over fifty, think again!  I am 64 years young.  Just follow the rules of fashion for wearing them.

I was so incredibly excited to see this skirt (as I am a total Batman nerd). As soon as I saw this product listing, I repeatedly took my measurements and cross referenced them several times with the measurements listed to ensure I selected the correct size; regrettably, I neglected to fully inspect the section of the description that stated what material this skirt was made of. I based my purchase solely on the photo listed, which for some reason caused me to believe this skirt would be more like a scuba material or perhaps even cotton. Unfortunately, I opened my package to discover an incredibly thin, shiny, stretchy, and silky material. Furthermore, although I understand the Batman logo would only be printed on the outside of the skirt, I was somewhat upset that the inside of this skirt was bright white. This skirt has no hem on the bottom and this style is meant to flow, so the interior is definitely visible when you wear it. I think that a black interior would be an incredible improvement to this skirt. Honestly, it kind of reminds me of something a person might wear for a fun run or some other athletic team event. I am still going to try to find some occasion to wear it someday, but this is not something I feel I could just casually wear.

I wasn't sure what size to order because a lot of clothing like this piece come from China, which has a pretty significant difference in sizing than the US. I thought I'd play it safe and go for the medium. It fits me well. I would normally wear a US small but the medium fits my waist just fine. I have a feeling the small would too. The power of elastic! I'm short, about 5'1, this skirt hits right at/slightly above the knees on me. The Batman print is fantastic, no issues there. I'm leaving a 4 star review and not 5 stars because this skirt is not hemmed at the bottom. It won't be a problem as far as pilling or fraying but as a seamstress myself I think it looks sloppy without a hem. No hem seems to be the standard on digitally printed clothing. I understand why they didn't do one, but seriously, it doesn't look as nice. The lack of hem is my only complaint. I can't wait to wear this skirt to the next con if I don't happen to feel like cosplaying. Also I'll don the heck out of this skirt, going to be wearing it a lot.

I do not dry my dress cloth so I can not say how it will fare in a dryer but it seems durable enough to be dried on a low or medium heat setting. I like the deep red color, I am very pale so any bright reds tend to make me look sickly so the deep red is a great compliment to the skin tone.

I love Vera Bradley because it is the only affordable \"name brand\" on the market. This wallet is no different as far as the quality of their products go. It is great and will still hold up for many years to come. Other than being a bit stretched out, mine still looks brand new a year later. The newness one year later is impossible from a company that is not super expensive other than Vera Bradley! I like how there are so many patterns.

There is a slip attached to the dress to prevent your undergarments from showing, but recommend wearing nude undergarments for the white dress. A bandeau showed at the holes of the arms, but a strapless bra did not show.  The zipper on the back functioned well. I appreciate the length is short enough to be flirty, but still modest.\n\nI was really nervous about the size based off of what other reviews said because I couldn't figure out what size I needed. I was actually going to order a large, but there ran out of stock at the time luckily. It does run a little small. I ended up with a medium, which fit me. For sizing, I recommend that you follow the chart they provided (not Amazons general sizing chart) as it seemed pretty accurate for the dress I received.

It came in exactly like what is pictured on the model (which is sadly rare nowadays with so many sellers using other people's photo that \"look like\" their product, but isn't actually the same)\nSize: Fits very true to size! I'm 5'4\" 124lbs 34C, I got a medium and it fits exactly how it does on the model. I usually always wear a small in tops unless I want to wear it with leggings (which I did with this shirt) then I'll get a medium. I was a little scared it might be too baggy since it already looks loose fitting on the model but I figured since its cotton, it would shrink anyway. I'm glad I got the medium because it fits exactly like the model, although I haven't washed it yet so hopefully it doesn't shrink too much. (I'll try and update once I do)\nLength: The length is great for wearing with leggings. It's a curved hem with the sides going slightly higher to accentuate your curves.\nMaterial: The feel of this shirt is really soft, which is always a plus. It feels like a rayon & cotton blend so it feels really nice on your skin.\nSleeve length: The sleeves aren't as long as shown on the model though. They're slightly shorter than I'd like but you can make this work. It's not noticeable because you can just pull it up a little like 3/4 sleeve, but I like longer sleeves so that was the main reason I didn't give this 5 stars, although I would've given it 4.5 stars if I could (the only other reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the sewing on the sleeve was noticeably snagged at the wrist, but I'll just have my mom resew it. I don't think this would be a problem for every shirt though)\nThe print on the Sleeves: The material is made up of a spandex material, which is great because it feels really nice on your skin, and the print itself is really nice. It's like a tribal print, and really gives the shirt something extra.\nButtons: They're all real (i.e. you can actually button and unbutton all of them) and look like the picture.\nShipping: Pretty fast. It was free shipping, which is always great, and it came in 11 days from my order date.\nOverall, it seems like a really nice shirt. As long as it holds up in the wash, I would definitely recommend.", "summary": "Good quality nice shirt!", "unixReviewTime": 1454112000}

The metal bit that attaches to my backpack seems pretty sturdy so I don't have to worry about it falling or randomly coming off.\nI have gotten a ton of compliments on it, and should I need another one any time soon I would definitely buy another.

My work wardrobe looks a lot like other peoples weekend-not-leaving-the-house-today clothes. Every once in a while something special will come up. My spider-killer will surprise me with an evening out, a charity event that requires that I look like the grown-up that chronologically I am, or one of my kiddos is involved in something and I get invited. Inevitably I greet those occasions with mixed feelings: while I love the thought of going, I hated the thought of finding something to wear. This stunning Max Coburg dress has changed that  I cant wait until the next invitation to go somewhere nice!\n\nThe Max Coburg Pencil Dress is a beautifully made dress that is suitable for everything from high-end business meetings to formal events. The 100% nylon fabric hugs curves without emphasizing flaws and offers an incredibly comfortable wearing experience. A covered zipper runs from the back of the neck down to the bra line and zips smoothly and easily. 2 inch cuffed sleeves in white contrast with the starkness of the black dress and give a finished, polished, feminine nudge. The fold-down V-collar is in the same white as the sleeve cuffs and creates a flattering face-framing appeal that is subtly sexy. The smooth silhouette is quietly provocative and the black color brilliantly hides problem areas (like my upper arms and tummy). This dress is hand-wash only and the tag indicates that it should not be soaked  I was concerned that warning was there due to an issue with colorfastness but I didn't notice any color bleed at all when I washed it. Im 53 and ordered this in a size L. The hem hits modestly just below the knee and is a knock-out with boots or stockings & heels. Stitching is tight, straight, and even. Hems and seams are finished beautifully. My favorite feature, by far, is that the nylon seems impervious to snags  I have never found that in any smooth finish dress before.\n\nI received this stunning Max Coburg Pencil Dress at no cost in exchange for an unbiased review and love the quality, the fit, and the look!", "summary": "Great quality dress that is insanely comfortable, beautifully tailored, and subtly sexy", "unixReviewTime": 1456790400}

This dress is absolutely GORGEOUS! I was surprised at how beautiful it is and how well it fits. My biggest fears with this purchase were that the dress would be too small in the chest area (I am a 36D) or too long (I am 5'0). I was pleasantly surprised at how nice this fit.\n\nThe chest area is ALMOST too small, but nothing that will stop me from wearing it. I don't need to wear a bra with this because it gives me good coverage. The dress is long, but the slits in the sides make it very easy and comfortable to walk in.\n\nThe material is perfect for a summer here in hot and humid Florida. The material is thin, but not cheap. It's thin enough to keep you cool all day long. The buttons are secure, so you don't have to worry about them popping off throughout the day. The material is easy to wash, too.\n\nIt's the style of this dress that makes it stand out among others. I LOVE the peek-a-boo waist area. I think it's a sexy touch, without it being too revealing. The buttons from top to bottom are fun and stylish. If I am feeling flirty, I unbutton the top 2. The slits are the side are gorgeous. This is a dress that I'd wear for a day of shopping in Miami or for a relaxing day on the beach.\n\nI recommend this dress for anyone wanting a cool and stylish look for the summer!\n\nSample received for evaluation.", "summary": "PERFECT Summer Dress!", "unixReviewTime": 1463961600}

This band is AMAZING! These guys at Geckota are doing things right. I just bought the new Apple Watch 2 Sport and I wanted a nice band to look professional in when I wasn't hitting the gym. I don't know why I had to scroll through hundreds of cheap nearly plastic mass produced watch bands in order to find something of this quality. The price is totally worth it. It looks just as good as the $100+ bands and is vastly superior to the $19 bands you find everywhere else. I love the texture, the color (which was such a hard thing to find!), The beautiful stitching, the perfect fit, and how easy it was to assemble. They even provided spare parts incase you misplace one! I'm not being paid, nor did I receive any sort of discount for my review. I'm just so impressed with the quality of this product, and the customer service this company offers. I live in California, and assumed that since the watch was shipped from outside the U.S that it would take at least 2 weeks to get here. But it got here in less than 10 days! I thoroughly plan to add other colors to my collection of new watch bands and I know I won't need to look anywhere else for what I want. I've found it all right here.

The stones are very beautiful and definitely of great quality as they are noticeably real and not plastic. They are nicely polished and the stones vary slightly in shape, shade, and pattern variations. Also, for those looking for the energy/effects of the bracelet (including me), this bracelet has the effect of bringing optimism, insight, power, integrity, etc that the tigers eye stone possesses.\n\nOverall, this is a great quality, earthy stone bracelet that will last a long time and will be worn a lot!

It feels very comfortable to wear, I wore it all day and all night as a slept and barely noticed I had it on.

It is a calming, serene stone that reduces stress, helps you work through negative emotions and unhealthy attachments and helps open you to work with your angel and spirit guides. It aids healthy meditation and helps combat insomnia and anxiety. It helps you deal with situations with subtlety and tact. Think of it as a peaceful, serene stone. Be open to communication from angels and spirit guides by \"coincidences,\" personal signs, intuition, repeating numbers and dreams.\n\nTo add icing to the cake the bracelet came in a high quality grey linen craft box with a beautiful logo (as a graphic designer these yummy aesthetic details things put an extra edge on a product!).

I have become particularly interested in tigers eye, blue sandstone and goldstone. When I came across this tigers eye bracelet I was super excited! The item was NOT prime, but I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly it arrived ( in about 4 days). It is send via USPS first class mail. When I opened the package I was immediately excited when I saw how lovely the package was. The bracelet was packed in a very nice gray box, inside the box laid the beautiful bracelet. The bracelet is adjustable (rope), and will get as big as about 10.5\", the smallest is about 6\". The 6\" fits my wrists perfectly. The stones, oh my, the stones are lovely in my opinion. The beads are not perfectly round, as per the picture below you will see a close up of the beads, one of them actually looks like there is a chunk missing out of it, and others don't look fully polished, but this is how it is meant to look! It represents real gems,  how all of the gems are different than one another and no two are the same. I am so happy it looks like this rather, than a perfect tiger eye round ball. It gives it character. There are two balls that are connected to the rope, this will help adjust the rope.

First off, it comes very professionally packaged and that always says a lot to me when I receive a product and the box that it comes in is way more than I was expecting.  This would be ready to go if you were to gift it to somebody.  Another thing, inside the box there was a card with a cool little \"blueprint\" drawing of the bracelet that said thank you from the designer/seller.  This is my first \"beaded\" bracelet but I can tell that this is the company I will be going to if I plan on purchasing another one from.  I am very much into spirituality so to have this on already feels great.  The stones are actual stones and the bracelet has a weight to it, nothing crazy, but you know that is made of high quality.  I have already received compliments on it.  It fits great, and it will fit any wrist.  The two strings allow it to open up a bit to get on and it tightens down and stays there with just the pull of the two strings.

I loved the other ones so I decided to get more for my 3 year old daughter. The fit is perfect. They don't fall off or cover too much of her face, but there's also room for growth so she'll be able to wear these for quite a while. The frame quality is great. It has strong, flexible plastic and the hinges seem like they'll stand up to the inevitable stretching that kids love to do.\n\nLenses, Case, Opinion:\nThe lenses arrived scratch-free, and they still don't have scratches after numerous drops. I love that the glasses come with a hard case so I can throw them in our  backpack and not have to worry about anything happening to them. The case is cute and the zipper works great. Though it honestly doesn't matter, I wish the case was a little more neutral and less boyish. If I had seen these in the store and my daughter tried them on, I would have been happy to purchase them based on fit and quality.\n\nDisclosure:\nI received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

He was the only one of the group to have a poncho, and it saved him! The poncho was plenty big for him, and was actually big enough to keep all his clothes dry, and all of him dry but his boots. It is a heavy-duty, material that seems to be made of good quality. It did not rip or tear in the first few uses. Hubby told me he will always take this with him on any camping or other type of outdoor trips.\n\nOverall, I do recommend this poncho to anyone looking to keep dry in weather.

This company has the best designs in the world, ESPECIALLY if you're a cat lover (like myself).  I opened this shirt in front of my niece and nephews and they all loved it!  We've decided that instead of Captain America, this design should be called Kitten America!  I have to admit, this shirt is a little too small for me right now.

He loves Avengers and all things super hero related, but also loves cats like me...so this shirt fits him to a T!  I ordered the XL.  I'm typically a 3XL or 4XL shirt, so I didn't even attempt to put this on yet.  I did note a few things, though.  First, this shirt has an awesome design.  I think anyone could enjoy the humor in this shirt.  Second, this shirt is lightweight and I think it would be great for summertime.  I don't think I'd recommend this shirt for cold weather but that's okay because it's a tee shirt.  Third, this shirt does seem heavy duty.  I feel like this shirt will withstand many, many washes and still look great!  There are no loose strings and the stitching seems pretty sound.

My son wears sunglasses to keep the sun out of his eyes (not necessarily for fashion), and the Speckaboo lenses (grey smoke in our case) block out enough sunlight to keep him happy.

It was a tad bit baggy but it was comfortable as he told me. The shoulder seams were proportionate to his shoulders. The width of the shirt is what was a bit big compared to him but there's room for him to use it as he grows and in case it shrinks over time. It is as long as he is so he doesn't \"swim\" in the shirt.\nThe shirt is really well made. The graphic on the front has rich, vibrant colors and it is as big as it seems in the photograph. It takes up about 1/2 the front side of the shirt. We haven't hand washed it and as the instructions direct, the washing machine is set at delicate and cold when washing this specific shirt. It has survived multiple washes and has not yet flaked or distorted in color or shape. He loves wearing it and the shirt, after about two weeks, looks the same it did as the day I received it. The colors do not run so they did not affect the rest of the whites that I had put in with the shirt. It did not noticeably shrink after its first wash. It hasn't been put in a dryer considering the caution advised by the company against extreme temperatures so it's left in the garage to air dry after being washed. It's not inconvenient and just takes a few hours to completely dry out.\nThe cotton is soft, thick and durable. The fibers have not unraveled, torn or distorted after multiple uses. It breathes relatively well so skin doesn't suffocate underneath it. Since the small size fits a 13 yr old, I would advise sizing up for purchases. If you wear a large normally, an xl may be a more comfortable fit. If you plan on using this in the washing machine and dryer, I'd advise going up two sizes just in case. It's always more comfortable to have a bigger shirt than one that's skin tight.\npros\n-excellent graphics\n-vibrant, sharp and long lasting colors which don't run in the washing machine\n-soft cotton is both comfortable and durable\n\nThe shirt looks great, fits perfectly, and has sharp, vivid colors. Although it does require some care for the longevity of the shirt, it's not something that warranted a star deduction. The shirt is unique and my nephew loves it. I would caution that you size up when you're purchasing, as I mentioned earlier considering that the sizes run a bit small.\nI did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion. The company did not compensate me in any way. Discounted merchandise does not guarantee a positive review so my rating directly reflects the product quality and function. I have provided an honest and completely unbiased account of my experiences.

It is similar to the picture but not the same suit. Also it is incorrectly listed as a women's, but is more like a kids size. I ordered up a size due to previous review and couldn't even get it on. I'm usually a small or medium. I ordered large. The bottoms covered maybe half my rear and I spilled completely out of the top. I'm a small C cup. The top does not extend below the chest area as the picture shows. It cuts off immediately below, which just makes it look odd. The neck line goes much much further in than the picture. Just very odd looking. I didn't expect the best quality for the price, but it should at least be the same suit!!\nUPDATE:  The seller is from China and admitted to using an incorrect US size chart for Asian size item.

The colors are so unique that I bought 2 of these bags nd my husband bought a third for Valentine's Day: marine, burnt orange and light gray (which has blue undertones)\nThe Good:\nColors are rich, bag is roomy but not too wide, strap drop works well for my height (5'9), cute little coin purse has a back pocket and inside zip. Bag is structured so that it stands on its own (I have a black pebble leather drawstring I really enjoy that sort of collapses onto itself once its set down).\nThe Bad:\nThe tassels at the end of the drawstring are large so it stops the bag from opening as wide as it could.\nThe Ugly:\nI doubt that I will buy saffiano leather again. I am a great fan of the rich Dooney leathers. Saffiano feels like coated canvas. Also, when I draw my pebble drawstring up it stays closed; this saffiano stuff allows the drawstring to relax just the slightest bit so the bag doesn't cinch as tightly as it could. Believe it or not the O rings look so much like gold plastic I literally had to bite one to assure myself they are metal (they are).\n\nShipping was a bit of an issue. When I checked the Fed Ex tracker my packages were scheduled to arrive on Friday; perfect since we were going out of town Sat. No packages on Friday so we cancelled the trip. They shipped Smart Post from I Love Dooney so the arrival date the tracker gave was the date the packages arrived at my post office, not at my house. Thanks, Fed Ex.\n\nOverall I am happiest with generous sized structured bags that I can toss all my stuff in, then throw on my shoulder. These bags fit that bill nicely and the colors are stunning. Had this bag been offered in these colors in pebble leather my rating would have been 6 stars because I am a solid fan of Dooney's design, material and workmanship.", "summary": "Stunning, but saffiano leather?", "unixReviewTime": 1455408000}

I cannot say enough good things about the layout of this wallet. I've had this for a little over two weeks now and I'm still finding little things that I like about it. It's replacing a well loved, brown leather bifold wallet, and I was used to the extra length by the end of the third day. This is my perfect wallet.\n\nThere's a giant pocket when it fully opens up that I use to keep whole sheets of paper in, which is really nice when I want to have a printout of something on hand, or need to take a few quick notes and know that I actually have something to write on. They don't tell you that it's there\n\nThe leather is really soft, and even though it's orange, it still has a really nice leather smell to it.\n\nThat extra long pocket/compartment is incredibly deep, and I've been using it as a dedicated spot to keep receipts and coupons.\n\nIt's meant to hold a checkbook, and they actually thought to include a pen pocket with enough room for the pen clip.\n\nIt's long enough that I can pull it out of my pocket while I'm sitting in the car without having to unbuckle the seat belt and get up.\n\nI got the orange version (I'm never losing my wallet in plain sight again), and it's actually the color in the photo. That might seem like a small detail, but the fact that what you see is actually what you get is really reassuring.\n\nI could not be happier about this wallet.\n\n3 month update: The wallet is no longer the bright orange that it was when I got it, and that was to be expected from any piece of new leather. It is still orange, just in a slightly more tamed fashion. What I didn't expect was how it is gradually wearing from orange to black, especially on the surfaces that take a lot of contact. I initially thought it somehow got dirty, but after a gentle cleaning, it was apparent that it was the material itself changing color. The more wear any given part of the wallet gets, the darker it will become. I'll note that this has been a daily use wallet in the back pocket of my pants, that the coloration is on the wallet itself and hasn't affected my pants at all, and this will likely never be a concern for you if you keep this in a purse or the breast pocket of a suit.\n\nThere is an opening on the inside of the change holder, which I'll just re-sew myself by hand, and probably reinforce with a very light glue or contact cement. This isn't a failure of the wallet itself, it's because I was using it beyond how it was intended to be. I keep this wallet in my back pocket, so gravity is keeping all the change in the bottom of the pocket. Combining a lot of change in the thinnest area with the stitching going into the lightest material, in a high use and high wear position means that this isn't exactly unexpected. The zipper itself still works flawlessly.\n\nThe plastic flap that is meant to hold the checkbook open so you can write checks directly on the wallet is still intact, and works very well.\n\nThis is still a five star wallet for me, and I'm ordering a second one as a backup in case anything ever happens and I lose this one.", "summary": "far better than I was expecting it to be", "unixReviewTime": 1456704000}

For anyone who intends to use reusable bags but can never remember to bring them to the store, they are the prefect solution. They roll up into a tiny tube shape that fits easily into your purse, backpack or coat pocket so you can always have them on hand whenever you do some last minute shopping. I've been keeping envirosax in my purse for several months, and I haven't used a single disposable bag except for when I've taken leftovers home from a restaurant and they put in in a plastic bag without asking me. They are also incredible durable, and hold much more weight than a disposable bag of the same size. Obviously, the pattern on the bag depends on your personal preference, but I think Jessie and Lulu is pretty adorable. Check out the other designs if you don't like it. They also make a lot of plain, solid colored bags. These bags definitely have an array of other potential uses to, such as a beach bag, etc.", "summary": "Everyone Should Have One!!!!!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1232150400}

Perfect for All Shoes & All Sports, Athletics, Work, Running, Hiking! \n\nLately one of my favorite pair of dress shoes started to get the insides all worn out and the shoes were starting to hurt!  I tried to switch the insoles from an older different pair of shoes and see if that helped but that only made matters worst.  This new insole was a little smaller (even though it was the same size) and would slide around a lot on the inside and would cause it to fold and be an issue.\n\nSo when I got these I was excited because they had a little padding and they were able to be cut down to be an exact fit!  I wear around a size 10 so as soon as these came in I pulled the scissors out and started working!\n\nEven though I used extremely sharp scissors, these were not the easiest to cut.  As you can see in the pictures its not perfect.  But once I cut them down a couple of time to get a perfect fit, it worked!  These fit the WHOLE insole and were extremely comfortable!  These insoles are light weight and feel soft on you feet!  You get a small amount of cushion on your heels too!  These are really good at moisture wicking too!  I highly recommend for anyone needing to replace or for anyone that wants a little extra support or cushion.\n\nClick YES if this review was helpful.

From me I would say yes. In most shoes, insoles are often the very inexpensive piece of item the manufacturer puts into a shoe. You may notice this when buying shoes, the insoles doesn't seem too great. Depending on the brand, the quality may feel real cheap like a thin piece of paper. It often provides little to no cushioning or stability.\n\nFrom my experience of buying mens dress shoes, I do feel a difference with better quality insoles. Even the expensive shoes I buy, I get disappointed when insoles are not good and doesn't provide support. Spending more than 8 hours a day on my dress shoes with thin or worn out insoles will lead me to experience some foot aches. Plantar Fasciitis may flare on occasions.\n\nThat even includes soccer cleats. Having bought expensive Adidas and Nike cleats, the inside will get beat up and wear out fast due to the constant running of soccer. I have experience some painful blister under my foot with a worn out insole from my Adidas cleats. So anytime you see it peeling or its breaking apart, its time to get new ones.\n\nFor those reasons I got this product, SHINAP Mens Sports Insole. What I like I can use be used for either athletic or dress shoes. Comparing to one of my old Dr. Scholls, I find it provides excellent if not more support. The level of thickness is great due to the material and designed of a Lightweight soft HI-Polyethylene low-profile footbed. Attached to the bottom is a soft blue latex material that provides excellent cushioning in the heel and forefoot area. I was able to cut my shoe size easily with the guided lines.\n\nKnowing not all feet are the same, having proper footwear is something we all share. If you find insoles to be very important for comfort in your  wear of shoes, please consider SHINAP.

The plastic is strong, yet flexible. Very important for sunglasses worn by kids who like to bend their glasses. The hinges are in good condition and seem like they will hold up to inevitable stretching. I gave these to my 3 year old daughter, but I tried them on myself to check the lenses. They block a good amount of glare from the sun, don't collect fingerprints easily, and arrived with no scratches. After being worn (and dropped) multiple times over the last 10 days, they are still scratch-free. These perfectly fit my 7 year old, but they fit my 3 year old better than most sunglasses. She has 1 other pair that fits well, but all others tend to be too big.\n\nDesign and Case:\nThe pink mirror lenses are unique, at least compared to anything else I've bought for my kids. They've only had the traditional dark lenses, so my daughter was pretty excited about the pink. The hearts are a nice touch to add some color and to make them cute. I could do without the logo in the corner of one of the lenses, but it's small and doesn't negatively affect the vision so it's not a big deal. The listing doesn't mention these come with a case, and I didn't look at all the pictures, so I was happily surprised when they arrived. It's a hard case that helps keep the glasses nice and safe when I chuck them in our backpack. The design is cute, and the zipper works well. I really like the glasses, and I'm very happy about the addition of the case.\n\nDisclosure:\nI received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

I have bought many pairs of sunglasses in the last few months trying to find a pair for my 7 year old. For some reason that is a very difficult age to find glasses for that don't fall off because they are too big or hurt behind the ears because they are too tight. I figured I would give these a try since my son kept complaining that he doesn't have glasses and his eyes were hurting.\nWhen these arrived in the mail, I immediately opened the package to find a nice, sturdy case that will protect the the glasses from scratches. Inside the case the glasses fit perfectly! when you first hold the glasses, they are surprisingly quite flexible but are still very sturdy. They are made very well and look high quality. My son tried them on and immediately got a smile because they didn't hurt him and they had red on them (his favorite color). They look really cool on and even though they are flexible, they stay on very well. These could easily grow with him because of the flexibility (they easily stretch enough to fit an adult) which also prevents them from breaking easily.

We are thrilled with both veils and are so glad we took the chance. Highly recommend this seller to anyone who needs a wedding veil. Will add pictures as soon as we can take some. It does need to be steamed to get the wrinkles out when it first arrives. We hung them in the bathroom through a couple of showers and the wrinkles came right out! I will add, the ivory veil is a light ivory, it's darker than the white, but you may want to dye it with a little fresh brewed tea to make it more of a dark ivory/champagne color if you are looking or those shades.", "summary": "BEAUTIFUL!!

Being rubber, they are fully waterproof to the top of the boot, and that also means they are easy to clean. The outside can be sprayed and he can put them right back in with no time needed for drying.\nSo far there has been no trouble with the liner slipping out when he takes off the boots. It is removable, but we've had no need to take it out. The boots are roomy so that may change later.\nHe is normally a size 8, but we bought a 10.

It is just about the same size as the authentic one. I was worried it would be a shiny material but it actually wasn't. It has a litttttle but of a shine but barely noticeable, I got the navy blue color. I absolutely love it! I was looking for a new \"diaper bag\" and I think this will definitely works.

My daughter had selected this dress to wear to senior parties around graduation, and even though it looked cute I was a bit unsure. The dress arrived fast, and is not as blurry as I was afraid. In fact it really only looks out of focus up close. From a few feet back you don't really even notice. My daughter didn't even notice at all, and she was wearing it. So no worries.\n\nThe fit is pretty much like on the model's photo - short and simple. The only thing we think needs a bit of fine tuning is the chest area - it's low and gapes a bit, even with a C-cup size. Rather than expose her chest to the world we decided that we will be adding a small piece a black lace to the area to make it more modest. The fabric is a cheaper knit, but being less expensive I wasn't expecting anything differently. Cute dress for the money. I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review. I will periodically update these reviews as I have more experience with the product.", "summary": "Better than I was expecting.", "unixReviewTime": 1461369600}

With this set you get the best of both! Then you can debate privately in the comfort of your own home!\n\nI've heard that traditional ties make you look thinner than a bow tie on account of keeping with the vertical lines..\n\nWhile theres some debate about that, the simple fact of the matter is; if you want to go formal you need a bow tie.  Its really going to be your best look anyhow.\n\nThe thinning power of vertical lines not withstanding, a bow tie is going to emphasize your manly physique as a whole.  One of the strongest elements of formal tradition is the starkly contrasted white V of the shirt against the black buttoned jacket.  The wider top of the V accentuates and broadens the shoulders, while the narrow bottom creates the illusion of a thinner waist.  The bow tie is integral in this illusion, as it draws attention to the wearers face.  A long tie, however, dissects the formal V into smaller and more obscure sections that just don't have the same effect.  Long ties also direct attention away from the face and towards the naval.\n\nAlso, long ties are more common when wearing a suit.  The saying goes, If you wear your tuxedo like a suit, it will look like a suit.  , you want your tuxedo to look like one; different from a suit youd wear any other day at the office.\n\nTime has proven that a tasteful bow tie worn with a tasteful tuxedo will never go out of style.  Its no coincidence that the bow tie is the namesake for the Gold Standard in Formal Tradition, Black Tie.\n\nI tried to provide as many photos of the details as I could because honestly when I look at reviews I first go to the photos to see the real life image of the item as I have found sometimes the stock photos can misrepresent what you're buying.\n\nI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review. It is also important to note that I did not receive any kind of compensation for my review and I do not have any connection or relationship to the seller. I rely heavily on product reviews when making a large majority of my purchases thats why my written opinion is always honest and unbiased whether I recieve a product at a discount or pay full price.", "summary": "5 star 3 piece set", "unixReviewTime": 1459296000}

The blue background with the white and orange really caught my eye and can go with a lot of different shirt colors and styles.\nMerchandise:  The pack came with a skinny neck tie, a bowtie and a pocket square.  It has a dark blue background with alternating white and orange flowers, the petals alternate their orientation too for a neat pattern. The skinny tie is a typical length and width of a skinny tie and the bow tie is a standard size.  The pocket square is a typical six inches by six inches.\nThe good: The color combination of these pieces is absolutely wonderful. The sizes are great and nothing out of the ordinary. People looking from afar will never notice these were a cheaper purchase when put up next to a shirt and suit.\nThe not so good: The quality of this merchandise is okay.  It will definitely last for a while but it is not the same quality as the very expensive ties you would buy at stores such as Lord and Taylor or Nordstroms.\nRecommendation: I would recommend this set of tie, bowtie, and pocket square for anyone looking for an okay quality and great color combination.\nPlease note I received this product at a discount for an honest review.", "summary": "Great Color Combo, Okay Quality", "unixReviewTime": 1457568000}

(You:  'What does that mean, ...an 'Eleventh Doctor?' Me:  \"...Doctor Who?\"  You: \"Exactly.\")  This is a nice set, inclusive of all the pieces, and while you can tell it's not silk, it's definitely not low grade polyester.  It's a heavy grade fabric, with a decent drape, and not too much sheen, particularly on the bow tie, which catches just the right amount of light in the folds.\n\nHowever, the skinny tie is reeealllly skinny, and measures only 1.75 inches.  It works for me, since I'm female, but if you're a burly lumberjack or The Incredible Hulk, then it might be a little too mimsy.  I have the color #6, and I can confirm that the product image is accurate.  The color choice actually caused me a lot of stress because burgundies can be so nuanced, and I couldn't tell whether it was a plum-toned burgundy or a brown-toned burgundy.  The answer is:  it's a brown-toned burgundy, like claret or a dried nosebleed.  (Gross, but descriptive.)  The silvery-white dots are very nice--they're actually squared dots, which give the pattern a little more flair.\n\nThe bow tie adjusts easily----having spent plenty of time trying to deal with a self-tie bow tie, I'll say that there's no shame in going the pre-tied route.  It looks neat and tidy, and is less likely to propel you (me) into a Hulk rage.  (smash.)  You can see how both ties pair with patterned white shirt in the photos below.  Mixing patterns is a great idea.\n\n---I accepted a sale price on this set, in exchange for evaluation and objective review.  If I didn't like it, I'd return it, but I think I've made a pretty wise choice---it's a handsome set.---", "summary": "Bow ties are cool.", "unixReviewTime": 1472601600}

I have been waist training off and on over the past 4 or 5 months or so and with the recent weight loss I've made it was time to drop down a size with my waist trainer. I can definitely see a difference in my shape from before I began waist training and my shape now. It does help to encourage the body to draw in around the waist to better define my hips. I usually wear one for about 3-5 hours a day for a week or so and then take a week off. I don't know if it is better for my body that way or not but I feel like I should probably give it a break sometimes, I don't want to overdo it.  Although the latex makes me sweat underneath I don't notice it at all until I remove it. It doesn't feel hot, I think it just causes a little sweat because of the lack of air flow. It doesn't transfer through the cincher onto my clothing either so know one else can tell.\n\nThis waist trainer seems to be well made. The eye hooks and seams are all strong and it is the right length for me to be comfortable. Well, as comfortable as I can be in a waist trainer lol. It definitely helps keep me sitting up straightly and remembering to hold myself firm. This is the first time I've tried this brand but I'm very happy with it.\n\nAs an Amazon Top Reviewer I did receive my waist trainer as a free promotional sample for testing and evaluation purposes.

I bought it for a cattle ranch where checking cows is done in severe winds or minus 20 degrees F.  I have to wear a jacket under it for warmth on the arms.  The hood is big enough to fit over a beach ball, so I put it over the hood of the jacket and twist it as tight as I can.  So,  I have this cone shape mass that sticks up and at first the cows had concern.  I wanted to put my radio phone in the inside breast pocket to keep it warm, but available.  The pocket is a bit short.  I keep my note pad and pens in the outside lower pocket, but the velcro is hard to open with gloves on.  Those pockets are quite large.  I can make do with this if it is not under 10 below zero F.  We had minus 20 F this last winter and this coat left me cold.  My biggest problem with the coat has been doing up the zipper.  It can take a long time and I have even had others help me with it.  This coat is not for extreme conditions.  It is a men's coat and I am a woman so there is way too much room in the stomach area and the hips are ok.  I bought it larger than what I needed.

This beach towel hit the nail on the head for both of those items.  After receiving the towel, my family took a trip to the beach where I received a ton of compliments on its appearance.  I agree it is beautiful but that's not my favorite thing about this towel.  The quality is great!  It is thick enough to soak up water when you are drying off but not so thick that it becomes extremely heavy or won't dry.  In addition, the size is just right as it covers a chaise lounge chair well.  Since purchasing this item I have washed it many many times and the beach towel still looks the same as the day I bought it.  It does not shrink or fade.  I have since bought several others in different patterns to give as gifts.  Each person that I have given one to inevitably calls me to tell me how much they loved it after using it.  My husband and I own a pool and, therefore, we own many beach towels.  This is by far my favorite.  I would definitely recommend this towel and any other Vera Bradley patterns in towels.", "summary": "You Can't Go Wrong With This Towel", "unixReviewTime": 1467158400}

It did not fit my husband who normally wears a large in t-shirts at all. Too short in the sleeves and too tight in the chest. Passed it on to me, perfect fit in the arms.. obviously as a men's slim not exactly designed to contour around womanly chests!  We are saving it for beach trips with the kids to use as a quick sun cover up getting out of the water instead.\n\nSo the cons are most definitely the missed mark on sizing. That being said, if the sizing had been correct.. I would have ordered a few more for the whole family. I love the contrast between the black and white color theme and the material is very soft against the skin. My favorite part of the jacket is actually the breath-ability of the fabric. Due to a genetic disorder, I am allergic to sunlight so regardless of the weather, year round I have to wear long sleeves and jackets to stay protected.. as you can imagine, that can get very hot! This is the perfect material to feel cool. I will be keeping an eye on this one to see if the sizing gets worked out so I can try it again hopefully for the whole family.\n\nI received this free/discounted sample of this product in exchange for a honest and unbiased review", "summary": "Great material but sadly too small even for slim fit", "unixReviewTime": 1463443200}

With this in mind and also knowing how he likes his clothes to fit him, I thought the XX-Large was a great choice based on the size chart in the item description.  As items like this come from overseas, they have a different cut and style to the clothing, so the size chart is a must.  A XX-Large there was very close to a normal large he would buy.  Even at XX-large, It fits close to the body.  Once it gets warm, he is a tank top kid and the hoodie fits over that like a light shirt.  Great to have in the car for after the gym too.  Not to heavy to get over heated and it breathes well.\n\nUnfortunately, just out of the package, the hoodie I received had a decent sized foot print on it and I had to fight through a lot a left-over threading.  It seems a little QC before packaging is in order.  I rated this 4 stars based on this.  I don't mind washing the clothes before wearing them, we usually do anyhow, but it should still be clean inside the packaging.  Once the hanging threads were handled (I cut them with a sharp set of scissors, then a quick blast of heat from a lighter to seal the edge), everything else looked good.  The seams are very solid around sleeves, hood, and zipper.  The zipper has a nice even pull to it and it easily glides from top to bottom without any snags or loose teeth.\n\nWhen he received the present, he was completely thrilled.  I don't normally buy him clothes.  One, he's old enough to do it himself and two, our styles don't always line up.

The images are TERRIBLE quality, blurry, uneven, off-center, dull....I could rant on for pages.  I want my money back and I will NEVER be ordering another product from this company again.  What a waste.", "summary": "this hoodie is the WORST POSSIBLE PURCHASE YOU COULD EVER MAKE", "unixReviewTime": 1456185600}

Just in case some of these elements aren't as apparent to other potential buyers, however, it is worth noting that the collar does not go all the way around (It stops on the shoulders) and this item is entirely shear.  It also does not come with any kind of camisole so you will have to wear something under it.  Additionally, the color is a true coral- in that even though the photo looks a little more on the pink side, the actually color of the blouse has more of an orange tint. On the whole though I really like it a lot- especially for the price.  It was packaged well (with tissue paper, folded in a clear plastic bag which was then placed in the shipping envelope.)  For sizing reference,  I'm 5'5\", 126 lbs, about a 28In waist and wear a 34B.  I bought a medium and it fit perfectly.  It's not tight in the arms but it's well fitting where it should be.

The hat has a wire brim, and light cardboard top. The cloth is a little padded, but this ships in a flat box, in a bag, so you will need to fluff it up some. We stuffed a towel inside of it. The hair is decent, not too full or fluffy, but not sad looking like some I have seen. The sash is great, I just wish both ends had been finished with the fringe, as one end is raw and might fray. The hair is not as fluffy as the stock photo shows, and it doesnt wrap around like their photo, but it still looks great. The only thing I really don't like is the peacock feather is just cardboard, and it arrived with the edges already pulled up, exposing the white paper beneath the image. The 10/6 tag is also cardboard which is fine. We'll be replacing the peacock feather with a real one. Also, the inside of the hat has a Velcro band for adjustment, so even thought this is marked Adult Small, I can adjust it to fit my kid. I searched all over before buying this hat, looked at hat and wig separate or together on numerous sites and this price beats them all.", "summary": "Great wig/hat combo for the price!", "unixReviewTime": 1506556800}

If you're looking for a comfortable dress to go out in and not have to worry if you ruin it, you've found a great option. On par with Forever 21 quality, possibly a little better, obviously this dress is not going to last a lifetime but I forsee getting at least 5-10 wears out of it, possibly more if you baby it in the laundry. Nice little number that dresses up super cute with the right accessories and shoes. Fair warning: it wrinkles easy, so hang it up after laundering to avoid having to iron it.\nFit wise, it's kinda big. I'm 5'6\" and 125lbs, ordered a small, and it was a little too big. I threw a belt on over it and it looked fine. If there was an option for an X-small, I would go with that next time however, there isn't. Length wise, I was personally comfortable with where it fell but I could see some people considering it short, you do have to watch bending over. I also think the neckline is somewhat higher then pictured.\nI will probably purchase again when a color comes in stock in my size. Overall, if you're looking for a cute dress to wear out to bars or clubs and be able to spill drinks out without worrying about ruining since you got such a good deal, go for this dress. Alternatively, if you're looking for a comfortable dress to wear to class or errands, this would also be a great option.

That aside, I love this dress and the fit is very flattering.\n\nFor reference, I ordered according to the sizing information in the product description. I'm 5'2\" and typically wear a size 6, 32-34C bust, 29\" waist, and am pear shaped with 38\" hips.\n\nThe length falls just below the knees on me, making this perfect for church or work. The material is stretchy and comfortable and small print means you look smaller. \n\nI'd recommend ordering your size based on the product description. For me, the fit is right on and because of the bit of stretch, it's forgiving and looks tailored to fit.\n\nThis dress is made in China. Love the elegant neckline, peplum waistline, and 3/4 length sleeves. The zipper is well hidden and pulls smoothly and easily.\n\nThe fabric is of a nice light weight. It's thick enough to not be see through and thin enough to keep cool. Love that it's light enough to wear through Spring and Summer but could really be worn in all seasons. No need to wear a specific type of bra or a slip, it's not lined but the fabric is modest. This is an easy outfit.\n\nI machine washed it in warm water, as instructed, and hung dry. Didn't experience any shrinking, fading or pilling. I washed it in a lingerie wash bag so that the buttons wouldn't snag other articles of clothing and vise versa.\n\nIf you don't already have some and are interested, these are sold here on Amazon and I recommend them,&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Allove-Set-of-4-Premium-Micro-mesh-Laundry-Bags-for-Delicates-Sweater-Bras-and-Organizations-Allove1402/dp/B00KVLRAFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Allove Set of 4 Premium Micro-mesh Laundry Bags for Delicates, Sweater, Bras, and Organizations(Allove1402)</a>&nbsp;(I've reviewed them with photos on the product page and they're holding up well).\n\nI think for the current price of under $20, this is a great value. Perfect for office to evening wear. Hang drying does leave it a bit wrinkled but nothing a light ironing can't handle.\n\nOverall, this dress is well made and arrived with no loose seams.  I've had it for three months and it's holding up beautifully.\n\nI wouldn't pair them all together but will also note that it nicely matches a houndstooth hat, scarf, and pair of shoes that I own (so the print is not an off shade from what's popular).\n\nUploading some photos so you can get a closer look at it upon arrival, see the fabric blend and wash instructions.

You always worry if it will fit, how long the skirt will be and if the style will suit your figure.\nWhen I saw this dress on Amazon, I fell in love.  I adore the hounds tooth pattern.  This outfit looks really expensive.\nI ordered a medium and worried that it might not fit.  When it arrived I was so excited, it fit perfectly.\n\nThe fabric is quite thick.  No need to wear a slip.  It is made of a cotton, nylon and spandex blend.  The fabric is one way stretch.  It will hug your curves but will not stretch at the hem or the sleeves.  Fabric care is hand or machine wash on delicate cycle.  Dry cleaning can be used alternately as well.\n\nThis dress was thoughtfully designed.  It has a slight retro style.  It looks like a two piece but is actually one.  This dress features a peter pan collar accented with velvet covered buttons,  length sleeves, a peplum waist and zippered clousure.  The skirt is tapered down to fit the hips and hug the curves.  Hem is slightly below the knee (on me)  and has a kick pleat at the back.  The peplum and collar are trimmed in black piping. And looks great.  The quality of this dress is astounding.  This is absolutely a high end dress.  Great care was taken when this dress was made.  The stitching is flawless and seems are straight.  The zipper is a high end invisible zipper that operates smoothly. And maybe I should have lead with this; it is wrinkle free.\n\nI recently lost 77 pounds.  I haven't had a beautiful dress like this in my closet since I was a teen.\nI love having this dress as part of my wardrobe.  I am really enjoying it.\n\nI hope this information has been helpful to you if you are considering purchasing this item.\n\n&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/ANGVNS-Women-s-Retro-Neck-Houndstooth-Print-Peplum-1-2-Sleeve-Formal-Pencil-Dress-Gray-M/dp/B01B2AXEHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">ANGVNS Women's Retro Neck Houndstooth-Print Peplum 1/2 Sleeve Formal Pencil Dress Gray M</a>\nItem received on a promotional basis for a honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "This dress fits like a dream.", "unixReviewTime": 1457136000}

My initial observation of the quality of the shirt upon opening the package was that the shirt was well-made, with no uneven areas or defects. The material itself is cotton and is on the thin side but still durable. This is not too thick to where it would be too hot during the summer, but not too thin to where it will wear and get holes, or look see-through. The color is vibrant and is true to what I saw on my computer screen when ordering. The applique of the number/contruction vehicle is made of fabric, not plastic or iron-on, which increases the quality drastically in my opinion. The shirt overall is soft and attractive, and well made. It washed well and fit my size 3T two year old true to size. This will be a shirt he will wear a LOT all summer long! I definitely will be coming back to purchase the \"I am 3\" shirt next year once we see what size he's grown into for next summer, as I am very impressed with the style of this shirt as well as Fiream's quality in making this shirt.\n\nI received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

I got the blue and white, and I love the contrast of colors and the unique design. I am 5'5, about 110 lbs, and am a 34 small C.  I ordered a size small, and it fits me just as I expected it would. This is a well made bikini. The stitching is nicely done with straight seams, and no loose threads or snags. The straps are sewn securely on, and seem like they will hold up well. I really like the fact that both the top and bottom are lined. The top has pads in it, which I always appreciate as it provides a little extra shape, and helps prevent the nipple show through we all get when we are cold. Lol. The bottom came with a sanitary lining in it which I also appreciate. I love the way this bikini fits on me. It definitely is a more risque suit, and not something I would wear to take my kids to the public pool or beach, but for a romantic getaway with my husband it is absolutely perfect. The back definitely not full coverage, but is not a thong either. I would say it covers about half the \"cheeks\". I am very happy with this bikini, and can't wait for the warmer weather when I can wear it. If you are looking for a skimpier bikini that is flattering, and unique I would definitely recommend this one. *I received this bikini at a discounted price for testing purposes, and for an honest review.

It is just right that this can be worn this spring time, even summer or fall. It is simple but it is not plain at all, rather it is elegant  in style.  She liked that it will not overpower her necklace and other accessories that will go along with her overall outfit. It goes pretty well with her pants or her leggings.  She also said that this will also be perfect for belts or buckles.  The color was vibrant and did not fade when she washed it in the washing machine.  The quality of the material for which this top is made is very fine.  I think this will serve her for a long time which is really nice.

They are lightweight and exactly what I needed. I know they say men's but personally I never like the ladies style of sunglasses. I wanted something more squared and sleek instead of rounded and pink. The nose piece on these glasses is rubbery and flexible so they don't slide down my nose when I start to sweat and I haven't noticed a \"I just took my sunglasses off\" dent on my nose either. I'm pretty clumsy and have already dropped these glasses several times. Due to their light weight plastic design they haven't broken, bent or even scratched. These aren't the most spectacular sunglasses but if you are cheap like me and clumsy or forgetful (my last pair were lost somewhere -- probably the kids toy box) these glasses are definitely for you.

I did have it tightened most of the the way but I like the loose dangling twine so it works for me! I was also very happy that it looks just as the listing shows and is even better in person. Definitely a fine handcrafted bracelet with great attention to detail. The the metal zodiac plate is securely fastened with twine that is intricately wrapped around the thick cow hide. It's available in all the zodiac signs but I ordered the Taurus symbol. I want to add that the the detail in my Taurus stamp is very precise. Very impressive since you only see that kind of detail in high end jewelry. At first the bracelet is very stiff but I was happy to find that after wearing a few times it has softened up. This is a nice well made and stylish bracelet. Designed to look great and last a lifetime.

I am a size 12, but I thought I would give this suit a try because I have been in need of a one piece suit for swimming.  Bikinis just aren't made for active swimming!\nI struggle with finding a decent fitting one piece suit because I'm tall - and it's nearly impossible to find something at a low price that isn't giving me an epic weggie or cameltoe because it's made for shorter people, so that is super frustrating. It's not something you find on the rack for 20-30 bucks at your big box stores and I'm not looking to drop over 100 bucks on a suit I just want for functionality.\nThis suit works for what I am looking for, although I would prefer the shoulder straps would cross over in the back so that I could be sure they wouldn't slide off my shoulders while I'm swimming, although that hasn't happened yet so it could be OK, just something that concerns me a little.\nSo - while it is not technically a plus size, it's got enough give in the 8/10 size to fit me as a 12.  The bust is a great fit (I'm a 36DD), and the best part of this suit for me is that it is for a Long Torso (I'm 5'10\").\nI picked out the dark blue and black suit and it is the same color as pictured on the site.  It's not a \"slimming\" suit, so if you have a tummy pouch, you're probably still going to see it a little because it doesn't hold it in for you, but because of the style it is more flattering than other one piece suits. The material is similar to other swimsuits, not too thin that it seems flimsy or cheaply made. The top does have some padding to maintain your modestly. The bottom cut is very modest as well, full coverage of the cheeks and not high-cut in the hips either. Modesty isn't my main purpose of buying this suit, but for those who are looking for something modest it would be a good choice.\nI only rated it a 4-star because it is not technically a Plus Size suit, but everything else is pretty spot on.

I don't even know how to say it fits because it's all over the place. I got a US10 (tag on the shirt itself says XL) but it is pretty form-fitting in the body, and I generally wear a medium or even a small. I would say the body of the XL (US10) is probably closer to a biggish size medium or a smallish size large (or M/L I suppose would also be an accurate descriptor). The top straps on the shoulders, however, are waaaay too long. They make this shirt sit super low on my chest, and the arms sag way down and are almost full-length sleeves on me, which might possibly be somewhat cute except the gap between that first strap on top and the next one down on the arm is just really big, and everything is super saggy and loose and gappy and just not in any way cute at all. It just looks so weird. Luckily, I can make this wearable by altering the straps at the top to be about half the length they came, and then it fits pretty much how it looks on the model in the picture. So I'm going to describe the fit as \"too small\" because while the sleeves can be made to fit in a decent way, since the strappy parts are pretty thin and easy to cut and resew back in place (although I have to remove stars for even needing to do that in the first place), the body is not anywhere near a size XL. Still, I guess if you know what you're getting into it's a reasonably cute and comfortable top, as long as you size way up and are open to making some modifications.", "summary": "I got a US10 (tag on the shirt itself says XL) but it is pretty form-fitting in the body", "unixReviewTime": 1470355200}

I love all the beadwork on the top and the chiffon layer really makes this dress look super feminine.\nThe dress is really long. Of course I am only 49 so everything is long on me. I had to have the dress taken in not only in the length but also the bust area. I ordered this dress in a size 6. For reference my measurements are 34 (B) bust, 28 waist, and 36 hips.\n\nThe measurements for this dress in a size 6 are as follows:\n__________________________\n\nFront Length  60\nBack length - 73.5\nAcross bust  16\nAcross waist  14\n_________________________\n\nThe dress fit fine everywhere except the bust and length as I stated prior. The bust was quite a bit too big in the cup area. I have a B cup and this dress seems more appropriate for a minimum D cup.  I had to have it altered in that area as well. I think this dress was made to fit a larger busted girl than I am.\n\nOther than the fact that I had to have it altered to fit, the dress is beautiful. It seems to be well-made. All beadwork was in place and the seams all lined up. This dress looked just like a dress I might buy in a higher end department store during prom season. To me it looks like at least a 300 dollar dress.\n\nOverall I am super pleased with this dress. I am not sure when I will have the occasion to wear it but I am sure sooner or later something will come up.\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis product was provided to me either free or at a discounted rate for reviewing purposes.

It is definitely shorter than most of my dresses but isn't short enough to be uncomfortable. For someone who isn't comfortable in their body, this dress is a Godsend!

It was crammed into a 7-inch box that was 5.5-inches tall.\n\nIt took much discussion to get Amazon to send a replacement.  When they did it was in a proper sized box, but the hat was still folded and crumpled.\n\nI realize that this sounds like it should be an Amazon issue and not a reason to ding the hat  but the manufacturer has provided the hat to Amazon in nothing other than a protective plastic bag.  It is poorly designed to survive the shipping process.\nIf this is something you plan to add to your wardrobe, do so well in advance of when you need it as you will need some time to reshape the hat.\n\nI was given the opportunity to purchase this hat at a discounted rate, in exchange for my unbiased review.

The dress is actually pretty modest in it's neckline and the straps are relatively thick, as well.\n\nThe fabric isn't stretchy, but it is flowy and the relatively firm fabric is VERY flattering because it doesn't show a lot of rolls or and underwear lines. I did use a fabric steamer on it to get the wrinkles from being shipped out.\n\nThe design is gorgeous. I love how the front is patterned so colorfully because it means that I don't have to wear a necklace with it and it will still look dressed up! The coloring is super flattering on tan or pale (me!) skin.

Will NOT turn your skin green like silver rings with a higher nickel filler content.\n- Unique, and definitely affordable\n\nThe Cons:\n- Ever so slightly darker color than the typical pinky pale rose gold. The actual color of the ring I received is closer to the copper tone of a new US penny.\n\n3mm Stainless Steel Thin Prong Cubic Zirconia Wedding Ring Bands for Men and Women, Gold/black/rose Why choose Stainless steel Jewerly? Stainless steel has become an increasingly popular metal choice for fashion jewelry, because of it's bright,silvery finish and its resistance to tarnish, Excellent Durability etc. It not like silver will be getting black,not like copper jewelry allergy prone, not as alloy jewelry because of lead. Stainless steel jewelry is Fade-resistant,No Rust, Anti-allergy.\nI received my ring in the mail about an hour ago, and have been wearing it since. I find it pleasant to wear, due to the inner rim of the band, which is designed a comfort fit - this means the inside is rounded slightly, which leaves no edges to dig into your skin when you move your fingers at the wrong angle (and though this one is just my opinion, I find it also suspends the band ever so slightly above your skin so that it allows the skin under it to breathe a little better and not chafe). I love comfort fit bands, and am pleased that this one is.\n\nThe color of the rose gold is slightly darker than I expected, and if I had any cons about this ring it would be this: the color is a bit closer to a light copper in my opinion, and while I note this with a mild disappointment, it's still quite beautiful. The CZ gems are clear, sparkling, and a bright white; they are set without visible prongs into the band, and while I wonder if they will hold up to every day life and the test of time, the ring IS made of steel, so I would hope that will mean that they will remain there. None are missing as of receiving the ring, so we're off to a good start!\n\nIt's a very simple and classy ring, and I think that it fits well. It feels like these are true to size. The band doesn't feel too wide or thick to me, and I do like that this is stainless steel. I really can't say more about it other than this is super cute, and I'm very glad I got this!!\n\n Find your fashion stainless steel jewelry for your lover here.

Just as couples ring, couples bangle/bracelets,couples pendant necklace etc. Affordable prices and fashion styles. Mealguet Jewelry collection all with high quality stainless steel and latest styles. Find one for your lover.\n\nThis is a nice small ring. The only downside is that the band is kind of thick, and the edges are squared off so it's going to take a bit of getting used to. However, I've been wearing it ever since I got it.\nThe CZs are tiny, but very sparkly.\n\nFeatures:\n- Material: Stainless Steel, Nickel Free\n- Width: 3mm, Size available: 5,6,7,8,9,10\n- 4 Colors for your option\n- Unsiex Wedding Ring\n\nBest gift for:\nbirthday, promise, engagement, wedding, annivesary and other festivals\n\nI received this product at a discount or free in exchange for an honest review.

First, I based my expectation on how the model looks, not how the dress would realistically look on me. The dress on the model for this is not the same dress that they are selling. Before you buy it, make sure that you see it on the mannequin. It looks different than it does on the model. Second, the top is very stiff. It does not list this. The breast areas are also padded, which is not listed, and it is VERY low cut. With my bust, it is inappropriate to wear something this low cut. I am also now a size 8-10 with a 12 normally fitting me loosely, and this size 12 that I ordered is a bit tight, so the dress runs small. It also is NOT an empire waist....the skirt of the dress will cut you in half.

It's certainly attractive enough, even somewhat mysterious looking as light bounces off the seeming vast field of blackness within the bezel.\n\nThe four function buttons are arranged in a line along the left side of the watch body (rather than the usual 2 and 2 placement); this contributes to the sleek look because the bezel extends a bit past the main body, so that the buttons appear flush with the bezel - a nice little design touch. The buttons are large but, in keeping with the sleek design, are spaced right next to one another with no separation - smaller buttons spaced a bit apart would be more effective, especially if you use the various alarm/timer/chrono functions a lot. Fortunately, the Light button is topmost.\n\n(The bezel, by the way, is actually a ring that you can rotate counter-clockwise (making a little clicking noise as it moves); there are 4 little square indentations that seem to correspond with the four buttons so you can rotate the ring to position them next to the buttons. I'm not sure what purpose this serves and there's nothing in the instructions about it.)\n\nThe display is a bit of a mixed bag. First, there's an inner bezel that's slightly bigger than the outer bezel on the case; this means the actual face is smaller than you expect and the figures seem a bit spidery (in relation to the size of the watch); not a problem if you have the watch up near your face but could be when glancing down at your wrist for some people. The silvery-grey LCD against the black face is well-defined *provided* you can get the light to bounce off at the right angle; this may involve twisting your wrist around when the light is dim. The blue illumination is 'subtle', especially, again, at some distance from your face.\n\nThis watch is not only large but it's also quite thick so you may have problems buttoning a long-sleeve cuff over it.\n\nOverall, this a handsome watch, on a scale of S-M-L-XL-Huge-Massive, a solid XL. A few niggles but they're all fairly minor. Price was quite reasonable. You'll probably get some nice compliments on it.", "summary": "Handsome watch for beefy wrists", "unixReviewTime": 1486166400}

I've received several compliments on it recently.  I bought this watch primarily as a work watch and it has held up well.  I work in an industrial environment and so far there are no scratches on the crystal.  The rotating bevel is elevated sufficiently enough to provide pretty good protection to the crystal from glancing blows.  The bevel spins but serves no purpose really.  Honestly, I would prefer it not to spin at all and be in a fixed position.\nThe buttons are what I expected although I question how intuitive the operational functions are, like setting the time and date.  I figured it out but the sequence of buttons I had to press didn't seem logical to me.  I am not a watch expert.  Just to be clear.  This nuisance won't matter to most though.  Once the time is set, you really won't have to worry about it for at least 6 months for those living in time zones using day light savings.  The watch does not automatically adjust for DST so you will need to adjust it.\nApart from these minor things, the watch is cool.  Stylistically, it is cool enough to elicit the attentions of my colleagues, and it keeps times perfectly well.  It is also, as is advertised, waterproof.  I have had this watch in the shower and submerged in water without issue.  However, do not operate the buttons while in the water as the instructions indicate.\nFor $12.00, you can't beat it.

Along with it fitting how I want a shirt to fit, I enjoy watching people read the shirt and try to figure out the play on words. You can wear it out without feeling scummy for having an inappropriate shirt on.\nI recently had a chance to review several different sample t-shirts from Ann Arbor T-Shirt Co. Each shirt is a 100% cotton blend and has a soft and comfortable feel. I like a thicker t-shirt as a preference and usually the softer t-shirts do not offer the durable thick feel I look for. This blend for each of these shirts has found a nice balance in soft and thick. The shirts fit snug around the neck and shoulders and relax as it tapers down the arms. The tail of the shirt also tapers a small amount and creates a more fitted feel without getting tight. The screen printing is very pliable and held up to a first wash very well! That first wash also did not shrink any of the shirts in question.\nAgain, I did receive these samples at a discount (Not Free) in exchange for my opinion.

It is large enough to use as a shawl and the material is so light that using it as a collar wrap makes the nicest addition .  Beautiful design and so very, very soft.  I keep mine on the back of my computer chair at my station.  It takes up no room.  On really hot days, the a/c gets cranked up and the register blows in my direction.  My neck can cramp up so quickly.  Having the wrap within reach I can put it loosely around my shoulders.  The fabric is so light I hardly notice it at all, but when the a/c starts to blow I can wrap it loosely around my neck.  It's perfect for keeping the draft from my neck while keeping the rest of me cool.\n\nI ordered the blue and it does have a lot of blue in it but has a lot of autumn tones in it as well (reddish oranges)  This is not a \"cool\" blue shading, but a \"warm\" shading.  It's kind of difficult to see that in the picture ad.  There the blues look much lighter than they really are.\n\nThis would make a nice waist-hip wrap over a plain skirt in any of the many colors in the wrap.  Mine has a kind of \"gypsy\" look to it. It has the tassels.  Notice that some of the selections have fringe and some have tassels.  I like the tassels.\n\nBe careful in the laundering of it.  I would not use a washing machine, even on the gentle cycle.  I hand washed in mild detergent.  I would not wring it either.  I gently pushed rinse water out of it, folded once or twice, laid on large towel and rolled towel up to absorb moister.  Then I folded over a plastic hanger and air dried.  Came out really nice.  I washed mine in order to give an accurate review as I received the shawl as a gratis item in exchange for an honest review.  Really if you treat it nicely I would avoid washing until really necessary.  It washes nicely, but loses some of the original sizing properties that make it fluff up so nicely  when you first wear it.\n\nThis would be a really nice gift item for any woman or any age on any occasion.  It is one of the finest wraps I have ever seen.  Because it's made of cotton it breathes so nicely.  Most wraps are made of esters and they can make you too warm, so you're always putting them on and taking them off.  This one warms you but doesn't hold in body heat.

One of the issues that I run into with pajamas of this style is that they are usually too old for me to sleep in comfortable, even in the coldest months.  These satin pajamas were not so hot that I couldn't wear them comfortably, even when the house is warm.  Another issue that I run in to with pajamas of any sort is that they usually end up being too short.  I have a nicely rounded posterior that often pulls the legs of the pajamas up to a point that they are not long enough, which drives me crazy.  I like for the legs of my pajama pants to be long enough to touch the ground, so I was very happy when these pajama bottoms still reach the ground, in spite of the fact that the pajamas ended up being too small.  I typically wear a size 12, and the size large pajamas were listed as being a size 12-14.  Really, I would size these more as a 8-10; I could get them on, but they were too tight, especially around the arms.  I didn't have any issues buttoning the pajamas in spite of the smaller size, and other than the upper arms being tight and the slight bulge it created of my stomach, the fit wasn't terrible.  I am on a weight loss journey, so I have high hopes that these pajamas will fit more comfortably when I lose another 10-15 pounds.  All of the stitching is done well, with no loose seams or strings hanging anywhere and all of the buttons are securely attached to the pajamas.  The pocket on the front is also securely attached and adds a bit of unexpected elegance to the pajamas.  My overall impression of the pajamas is positive, but make sure you order a solid size up from what you normally wear.\n\n**I received these pajamas in exchange for product testing; the review above is a true representation of my experience with this product.  I have been in no way compensated for this review.**", "summary": "Comfortable and elegant; just make sure you order a size up.", "unixReviewTime": 1458518400}

Back of blouse hits right around mid-buttock like the one picture in red\n* My hips are slightly larger than most, but the top falls perfectly over them. Slide slits will accommodate most hips\n\nNow for the Quality:\n* Its a blouse worth $16.99, no more or less\n* The quality of the zipper is awful - it sticks, appears to be loosing teeth & barely works. It will break shortly. Since a return was difficult and would take more time/money, I elected to keep the blouse. Used a white crayon on the zipper to make it easier to move.

It wasn't really squeezing which is what I want it to do to train my waist.  So I returned it and ordered a Large which is for 24-26 inch natural waist.  I like it much better  It was tight on the biggest hook so it gives me room to shrink.  Some fat hangs out the top and bottom but is hidden by my bra and pants.  Since it stretches I could still breath easily.  After 3 days I could move it to the 2nd hook.  Now I don't know if the piece stretched or if I changed that allowed me to go to the 2nd hook.

If I got a 46 by mistake Id say my luck, because it fits like a glove. Maybe the company readjusted the sizes, I am sure at 57/ 170 cm and 153 lbs /69 kg I am nowhere close to a German size 46!\nMaterial is high quality if thin which is perfect for South Texas Fall temps. No problem with the zipper, seems super sturdy but I still have wiggle room in the dress. For women with bigger upper arms: you could take elastic band out and replace with longer one. Dress goes over knees by 3, which surprised me, I am not considered petite with 57 and long legs. Overall I really love it and for $30 its a bargain!

When I first went to set up the line I had a problem with the Representative understanding that it is NOT a \"WEARABLE DEVICE.\" Wearable devices are ex.. Apple Watch, Samsung Watch, LG G Watch, Pebble. This does not fall in that catagory. It needs a plain PHONE LINE with Talk, Text and Data. Sadly, its gonna cost, but that is another issue.\nOnce we got that straight, It was up and running perfectly.\n2) All DEVICES jump from Tower to Tower. So, all devices are irrelevant in that aspect, but it is your physical location to the towers that determine location. So, for me, it is accurate within 100 Feet of her actual location. But I am in NY amidst Hundreds of towers, so I am more accurate.\n3) As of 2017 Tmobile will be be carrying all of ATT's 2G customers. They plan on offering 2G for another year. Also, they carry tons of small wireless companies on their network, that rely on their 2G/ So, that is really not the biggest concern. I contacted QQ Tencent to see if they would be upgrading their product to 3G. They said they would. Only God knows when this will happen and you would have to purchase a new device.\n4) The operating instructions are not friendly.

I would bet that the only people who tested onboarding and wrote the installation manual were engineers and not \"normal\" parents...\n\nThe details...\n\nPros:\n- Feature galore: every feature a (slightly controlling) Parent would wish for such as see their accurate location from an app on your phone, chat, family chat cia voice recording, call your child, listen in on your child environment without them knowing, safe and danger geo zones with alerts, class mode, and more. AND you fully control your child's contacts and device from a far (only approve contacts can call/text or be called/texted)\n- Excellent hardware for the price: from packaging to plastic quality, wrist band, everything else feels great and I am usually very sensitive to that\n- 2G tech - contrary to the reviews below, the decision to go with the old 2G technology (think phones of the late 90s early 2000s = what the watch's manual refers to as GPRS enabled) is actually very smart because it keeps the price point down, the size of the watch is adequate even for a four-year-old and battery holds longer\n- The kids love it. We love it, we can easily reach them\n\nCons:\n- Awful onboarding: the instructions are just horrible and no troubleshooting anywhere!!!! You cannot even understand what the icons on the screen mean (short answer is if you see Xs it is not working) - solution is simple see below\n- Minor: must use military time, KG, KM - really minor considering all this watch offers and I am sure they can fix it in future app updates\n- Kids will call you non-stop for few days (remember when you got your first phone??), just threaten them with \"I will turn on class mode\" which you can do from your app\n- Support quality TBD but come on Tencent, a China support number for US customers, seriously??\n\nAnd finally most importantly - Onboarding... Caveat this might change by market:\n- Very easy: all you need is an AT&T or T-Mobile sim card that is not for wearables, I repeat: do not get the wearable line eventhough that is what they're going to tell you to get in the store and eventhough it is cheaper and costs only $10. It won't work - this watch needs to be treated as a phone. Pay a bit more ($15 per additional line if you are on AT&T or one of the prepaid plans on T mobile which will cost you $30-$40, maybe you can add a line on T mobile as well for cheaper? I do not know but do not add a wearable line),\n- A wearable line will show you reception bars and you will be able the see the associated network (click power then down menu button) but that \"X\" next to the bars won't go away\n- Ask the AT&T or t mobile tech support  to associate a real phone IMEI with your new line - it is very annoying that the watch does not come with such a number, believe me I've looked everywhere. But... the operator tech-support (ask for level two support) should be able to provide you with a fake number. Or... alternatively just take one off an old phone u have it is usually behind the battery (old prepaid phone works as well) and ask the tech support to associate your line with that IMEI number. Contrary to reviews below - any IMEI worked for me and it did not have to be a 2G Phone IMEI.\n- Now the \"X\" should turn into two up and down arrows next to each other, right to the reception bars and you r all set!\n\nLast note - yes AT&T is sun setting 2G support early 2017 so they can shift those radio waves to more advanced offering - in Atlanta, for now, it works great but at some point you may be forced to move to T mobile.\n\nHappy tracking!", "summary": "Great product, horrible onboarding/instructions", "unixReviewTime": 1463184000}

There are a few caveats that will hopefully be cleared up by a firmware update. Tencent is a not a well known name in the US, but they're a pretty big company in China; hopefully this means the watch will see a firmware update to fix some issues.\n\nMy use case may be a bit different than most, I'm not looking to track my child. I wanted to give them a limited use cellphone that they wouldn't forget to bring with them or leave behind.\n\nPros:\n* Activation was easy. I bought a T-Mobile SIM starter kit from the local big box retailer. followed the instructions and had it working in 20 minutes.\n* The screen is very bright indoors and easy to read.\n* Speaker is loud\n* App is easy to use.\n* Time, Date, and Weather are all set from the cell network. Once activated on the network, the watch adjusted to my local time.\n* Speakerphone is surprisingly good.\n* Ringtone is Loud.\n* Without calling, battery life is about 8 hours. (Considering what this thing does, I can't really ding it for a short battery life.)\n* GPS is pretty accurate outdoors.\n* I feel like I'm living in the future.\n* My child loves calling me from his watch.\n* Kid think its got Pokemon on it.\n\nCons:\n* The watch uses 2G, so in the US your only choice is T-Mobile. Check the coverage map! AT&T is shutting down their 2G network and Verizon doesn't support GSM, so you'll be stuck if you don't have decent T-Mobile coverage.\n* Needs a data plan to manage the watch.\n* The unit does not appear to be able to receive short code SMS messages, so if you're activating on T-Mobile, you won't be able to use the watch to login into the website to manage your account. I may have to add their short code number to the contact list to allow it.

My sister and I were excited about the features and it seemed the most aesthetically pleasing than other smartwatches we saw on Amazon. When it first came in the mail, we were please with the packaging and it looks just like it did online. That's pretty much where our satisfaction ended. It was a challenge to enter in contact group information and the photo of my nephew always seemed to disappear so it was pointless uploading it again after the third time. I live in the United States and it doesn't give you an option to change the settings from military time to standard time, Celsius to degrees, kilograms to pounds (child's weight), centimeters to feet and inches (for child's height) or meters to miles. But what's most disappointing is it's inability to give me the correct location of my child. Sometimes it's right, but most of the time it's wrong. I tested the SIM card in a cellphone to see if I could get an accurate location from Google Maps and it worked fine. I put the same SIM card back in the smartwatch and it shows me that my nephew is in a lake! Something this expensive shouldn't have this many issues.

The picture makes it look bluish, but the color is actually green. I am not a huge fan of the pattern or color. But... on sale it was $15!!! I am not going to argue with that.

It came packaged in a gift box with another item, and it was also wrapped in a plastic bag for protection.\n\nThis is really a cute little necklace, the chain is silver colored, 12 inches long.  At the end of the chain, theres a little round glass bulb that holds a few make a wish dandelion seeds in it.  At the top of the bulb is a matching silver colored dome covering the glass a little bit, and at the O ring that holds the bulb to the chain, there is a little silver charm that says Wish.\n\nI think everyone loves dandelions, even those of us who know they're just weeds.  Just the sheer joy of seeing a little kid blowing the fuzzy seeds away of a round lollypop dandelion while making a wish is always a delight.  With this necklace, the joy of that moment is with you around your neck all the time.\n\nIt looks dainty and delicate, but its fun and brings to mind summer filled days with loads of dandelions in the yard. The ability to see the dandelion seeds up close (we used a magnifying glass) made it even more special).\n\nGranted, this isn't the top of the jewelry line, but this necklace would make a great gift for anyone in your life that you want to encourage to dream and wish of good things to come!  I think it is really cute; I love how long the chain is and I think it would be an appropriate gift for a child or a grownup. I love the make a wish dandelion seeds inside, and I think it is really darling!\n\nRigorous honesty is a personal policy of mine so as a buyer and a reviewer, it is important to me first as a buyer to choose products that I am interested in to help serve myself and my family in some positive way.

LeCrone", "reviewText": "This particular pendant caught my eye because I enjoyed the look of the natural piece of dandelion encased in the clear bubble surrounding it. Unfortunately, the actual product I received wasn't quite like the ones in the product photos.\n\nThe pendant is a rounded shape and around 2 centimeters deep and across and around 2.25 centimeters high. But let's be clear: this is not an expensive, high-end necklace, and I wasn't expecting it to be one. While the exact materials aren't listed on the product page, it looks as if it's made out of some type of alloy metal with a silver-like appearance and plastic. The pendant comes on a thin chain with lobster clasp at the end. The chain included with the set matches the one shown in the photos, but the first one I received was broken.\n\nThe central core of the pendant appears to be clear plastic encased around two dandelion seeds. Unfortunately, the first one I received is quite dirty on the inside, and the outside is scuffed all the way around. The seller later sent a replacement that looks nicer than the first one (the chain wasn't broken and the inside wasn't dirty on the pendant), but there is only one seed inside so it's very difficult to see there's even anything inside, and definitely doesn't look as full inside as the product photos. The first six photos are from the original necklace, and the three ones after that are of the second necklace. Unfortunately for the second necklace the \"Wish\" part of the pendant was also put on backwards so you can't read it.\n\nWhile I appreciate the replacement and have updated my review to reflect my findings with the second necklace, I feel it's just \"okay.\"\n\nI am a longtime Amazon Prime customer who enjoys writing reviews in my free time. I was appreciative to be given an opportunity to test and review this pendant and necklace at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.

Included is a business card with instructions for use and washing on the back, as well as a box of 12 piece Crayola chalk in various colors.\nSize:\nIt seemed like it as going to be small, and I got the Large (10-12Y), figuring that it would fit one of my kids.  I tried it on my oldest, who is 13, but of smaller build (think 25th%)- it fit her perfectly, both in the shoulder and sleeve area, and length.\n I tried it on my 7 year old as well, who is is the size of an average sized 7 year old (think 50th%). My 7 year old can wear it, but it is is a bit big in the shoulders, and quite long.  She'll get plenty of wear out of it.  It is a fitted shirt, and if it were not, it would be too big on her.  Because it is fitted, it does not look odd.\nWriting surface:\nWe used the Crayola chalk that came with the shirt. The surface was smooth, and really fun to work with. The first photos which I will post, are pre-washing, and the latter ones are post-washing. Now I have a disclaimer:  the instructions on the shirt clearly state to wash and then tumble on low.  I forgot.  While this did not affect the size of the shirt- it's a really great quality- it DID affect the writing surface.  It was not as smooth as before.  I was still able to write on it, but it was not as smooth.  I think in future, to preserve the shirt, I will just hang it to dry, since I don't often have clothes that are dried on low.\nWhile I in my frugality would probably not want to spend as much on a shirt that will be outgrown, I DO think it would make an awesome, and unique gift for someone, and therefore worth the purchase.

I got the red color as my main purse is red and is a pretty good match in color.  Initially the credit card slots were very tight and it took some effort to pull out each credit cards but after about of week of daily use it got better as the leather stretched out.\n\nIts size is 3.75\" x 7.25\" (a little smaller than Amazon description).\nThe id compartment is 3 5/8\" long and 2 5/8\" wide.  It fits both the drivers license and the passport card (which is tiny bit large than the driver's license).\n\nDrivers license is 3 3/8\" X 2 1/8\"\nPassport card is 3 1/2\" x 2 1/4\"\n\nThere are two aspects to consider about this wallet. First, how does it fit all items one wants to carry in the wallet. Second, is RFID protection worth paying extra for.\n\nRFID\n~~~~\nWhen is RFID useful? There are three types of credit cards:\n1) Cards that have only magnetic strip do not emit any kind of data for the thieves to steal. RFID protection is not needed.\n\n2) RFID cards which are are identified by wavy lines on the card (see attached photo). These cards came into being a few years ago and has not became widely used. RFID chip cards produce radio waves which can be picked by thieves that are are a few feet away from the card and can be targets for electronic pick pockets. RFID protection is needed.\n\n3) The new EMV chipped cards they are now a requirement and are common. EMV cards work either by being inserted into a check out terminal or by Near Field Communication (NFC). NFC radio signals degrade very quickly, they can only be transmitted within a very short distance measured in centimeters. This need for proximity makes the risk of electronic pick pockets extremely low. In addition, the data transmitted by the card is encrypted which further minimizing the risk. Whether RFID protection is needed is more of a personal preference rather than yes or no purely based on the technology.\n\nSo what is the bottom line? For the old fashioned magnetic strip cards RFID protection is not needed at all. If you have the old RFID type credit card, the RFID wallets are useful. For the EMV credit cards they are not really needed but could provide peace of mind for those who worry.\n\nThis wallet is provided by Dante for evaluation and review. I hope my review was helpful to figure it if the wallet is match for your needs.  RFID protection is not a key feature for me, but I like the way it looks and the number of compartments it has.\n\nAli Julia review", "summary": "It is nice to have so many compartments", "unixReviewTime": 1456876800}

These socks are very comfortable and fit nicely.  The tops do not fall down while being active, the height of the upper part of the sock is nice.

Gives a bit of extra cushion in those areas that take the weight of being on your feet.  I have worn these socks running and they did not rub against my shoes, no blistering.\n\nThe color choices were fun to decide which ones to order.  I like the blended color.  Let's be realistic sometimes we go through mud or other things that turn our white socks dirty & grungy looking.  The mixture of colors in these socks the mud stains would not show up.  It is nice a smaller size pack of these socks is offered so someone can try them before they purchase a larger pack.  I am considering purchasing a larger pack of these socks for some friends that enjoy outdoor activities as well so they can try them.  I think they will enjoy them as well and the price is decent.\n\nI would absolutely recommend these cotton blend multi function socks.

You receive a ring, bracelet and necklace in each of the five colors.\n\nEach piece is made of a stretchy plastic that is double looped in a double wired style, so it is two pieces of the material run together. Also,each ring, bracelet and necklace are closed off at one end with a tiny black bead with the other end looped through before the bead is sealed on.\n\nThe bracelet is small enough to fit my 5 year old and stretches large enough to fit an adult wrist.  The ring fits my child also and stretches large enough to fit my size 9 finger.  The necklace stretches large enough for me to wear on my head as a headband.  I did notice that once the necklace was stretched out, it did not go back down to the tiny shape that it was before I took it off the card it was attached to, but not so stretched out that it wasn't useable.\n\nWith the elasticity of the pieces of jewelry and the strength of the material, I anticipate these lasting for quite some time for my girls to play with and enjoy.  If you are looking for a birthday gift for a little girl, this would be great.  And with the large set, you also could use it as party favors for goodie bags. The product recommendations are for 6 years and older, so you need to take that into consideration due to it being a possible choking hazard, but my 5 year old has never been a child to put non-food items in her mouth and she played with them under supervision.\n\nI did receive this product at a reduced rate for my honest and unbiased opinion based on my experience with the product.", "summary": "I anticipate these lasting for quite some time for my girls to play with and enjoy.

It had an awful fake carbon fiber print front, with a large submarine bubble cover.  But, it was affordable, small, and able to stack with other Boxy Winders, so I wound up getting more, especially since it performed flawlessly at the most important task -- silently keeping my watch wound.\n\nSince then, I see they have the \"Fancy Brick\" now, which is kind of an upgraded version of the original cube, plus this new series, the Castle Series, which I think is just about the best winder on the market and the fact that it's hundreds less than other winders that don't even look this good is just amazing, and my hat is off to Boxy on this winning design.\n\nI did not buy it here, because it wasn't on Amazon yet, but seeing it here now, I wanted to leave a review for other folks looking for a good winder.\n\nWith a small collection of various Swiss automatics, I have bought a number of winders over the years, and always I'd rather spend less where possible, so I have more money for more watches!  But a winder has to do the job.  I've had some good luck with Heiden, Belocia, even Chiyoba, and of course I love my Wolf Winder, but to date this really about the best winder I've purchased, and the price is really stunning for what you get.\n\nThis is a hardwood, matte finish, beautiful piece of furniture, with a glass cover that glides down on soft touch hinges.  The interior is finished in black and the clean, modern design is incredibly attractive.  They aren't trying to fancy it up, just keeping it simple and streamlined, and the result that it looks far more expensive than what you paid, and avoids the \"budget\" look of inexpensive winders that try to save money with plastic lids, fake stitched leather and overly glossed veneer finishes.  So, if you are looking for a winder you can be proud to display, this is the one, and your watches look great shining out from the dark interior (which very effectively highlights your watches as the main attraction).\n\nAnd, speaking of shining out -- this has LIGHTS!!!  Yup, two LED's inside light up your beautiful time pieces whenever it feels vibration, such as opening the cover.  And yes, you can turn those off, with a simple push of a button.\n\nIf there is any tiny drawback to this model, at all, it is probably that the controls are recessed into the front of the unit, and are a bit difficult to reach, for initial set up.  That's a very minor thing though, compared to everything that is so outstanding about this winder and it's not an area you need to access more than once anyway.\n\nMovement is absolutely silent, the watch holding mechanism is simple but effective, with a very firm foam pillow that fits snugly into the cradle, holding your watch very secure.\n\nAnother great feature?  Like other Boxy winders, it always returns your watch to an upright position, meaning the twelve faces to the top, so after each winding cycle, both of your watches face upright.\n\nWith a four pin switch system, there are a ton of variations for turns per day, in whatever direction you choose, so this also scores big points for being suitable for just about any watch on earth.\n\nFit and finish certainly matches or even beats winders four or five times more expensive and it excels where it matters most, in keeping your watches steadily and quietly wound.  Such is why I really do think it's one of the best winders on the market right now, considering you can spend far less without any compromise in performance or in appearance for that matter.\n\nI'm really impressed with this unit and will be buying a second one, once my collection expands.\n\nHighly recommend!!!", "summary": "Outstanding Purchase!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1472083200}

Do let me know if you have any questions!\n\nYou should know that I LOVE beanie hats. I do like it when they are not too tight or to loose.\nThis hat is a bit on a larger side, however, it's an easy fix. Wash on delicate/cold water cycle and dry it slightly for a little bit on delicate/easy care knits.\n\nAlternatively, you can just wash it on delicate cycle and line dry. Then, all you need to do is fold up the ends once or twice and your hat  becomes a bit smaller-this would fit perfectly. I tried it.\n\nI  really like the color and highly recommend it to everyone, 12-60 (and beyond). Light,  pastel (not neon!), neutral colors are always in style and work well with scarves/hats.  This particular color (light beige), goes with anything.\n\nI came home one day, tired after work, didn't exactly look all that great, and haven't taken a shower either (just got into the house). Well, I put on the hat (even before I washed it), and my face immediately lightened up. I  felt better!\n\n:=)\n\nKEEP IN MIND:\nIf you have sensitive, itchy, scratchy, allergy-prone skin like mine, I suggest finding a good quality soft scarf (cotton/silk, etc.), to wear underneath the funnel. It actually looks great as a scarf and it's an interesting concept.\n\nThis is a very nice outfit, however, it's not suitable for cold weather.  I can tell you that because I have a soft cashmere beanie and I wore a scarf on top of it on very cold days.\nTHIS outfit, however, is perfect, for low-mid 50's, even if it's windy, because it looks great and covers your  head and ears!\n\nFifties is actually my favorite temperature and I'm going to be wearing this  hat/scarf outfit!!\nThis color brightens up darker coats/outfits and complements lighter coats/clothing.  The hat is fairly soft and feels great on  my head.\n\nThank  you for asking me to test this product and share my thoughts.", "summary": "My favorite  hat/scarf combination!", "unixReviewTime": 1456012800}

My husband wears a belt everyday so that is good that it is quality and will last for him. The large belt size is for size 36 to 38 waist. I would say it runs a little large as my husband is a 36 and can wear it on the inner most hole on the belt. The suggestion was that it should be comfortable worn on the third hole of the belt, that is a little large for my husband. It also was suggested on the listing that you should buy bigger than your pant size which if I would have bought him a bigger size, we would have had to exchange it for a smaller size. I like that this belt has the ability to look nice with everything my husband wears without looking too fancy or not fancy enough. He wears it with his slacks for work and jeans on the weekends. I would definitely recommend this belt to others. It would make an excellent addition to your wardrobe or would make an excellent gift. I received a discount on this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "High Quality & Looks Very Nice", "unixReviewTime": 1456099200}

The material is light weight enough to drape beautifully. I was afraid it was going to look like a tent but it doesn't. I am 5' 6\" tall and a fairly fit 64 year old.  I generally like more fitted tops but this looks great with straight leg pants and I don't have to worry about any bulging around the back or around the waist. It is a very flattering cut for me but I will say that it would probably be best for taller women due to long length in the front. You will have to wear a bra with cut in straps if you don't want them to show.", "summary": "Very Flattering Top", "unixReviewTime": 1488412800}

This purse is not going to look gorgeous for even one season.  The little leather tongue that sits under the top clasp also is sticking out instead of lying down.  I have only worn the purse for a week as I write this review.  On the positive note, I adore the metal frame opening - it opens w i d e .  I can easily see everything inside.  The doctor bag shape is such a great design - everything is visible, not in some dark, black pit.  Also, the top fastener can be locked.  This is a huge bonus for extra security.
