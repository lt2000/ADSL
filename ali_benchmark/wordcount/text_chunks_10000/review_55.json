I was hoping for a darker colour - since we are running with a fruit theme let's say ...pomegranate?  blood orange?  But alas, it is raspmelon.  Waterberry.  It is not a bad looking ring, but I do have to admit the extent of the wear I've gotten out of  it so far is to put it on, hold it under different light sources and debate on the true colour.  (And I'm not saying that I did this, but if one were to take a sharpie to the coloured stone, one might alter the darkness of the colour.  But fair warning, it rubs off on skin and clothing, and when you decide to give the original colour another chance, it washes right off.

I'm 61, and it still looks old on me, so unless you're really young and don't care about how you 'appear' in age and you are somewhat 'big' in size (it does make me slender) then it's not a very flattering look on middle-age women.

Also, in my research on diamonds, I'd read very bad things about the clarity level of diamonds I purchased (I2 - I3).  Nevertheless, the 30-day return policy gave me the confidence to give Netaya a try.\n\nWell, I don't know if I just got lucky with these or what, but they are stunning.  Do they have inclusions?  Yes, but I had to go looking for them with a magnifying glass, and the only reason I did look for them was because I knew that with this type of diamond something had to be there.  The inclusions are black, but fortunately there is no cloudiness in these.  I'm not a diamond expert, but all I see when I look at them is sparkle, and I believe that is all any casual observer will see.\n\nThe price was absolutely amazing.  I am so happy with these that I had to put a review up.\n\nI will shop with Netaya again because, even if I did just happen to get lucky with these, their 30-day return policy makes shopping with them risk-free.

On first appearance they are very cute. We got these for my daughter's princess-tea-party themed birthday. Her decorations were all pink and gold and she wore a fluffy pink pettiskirt with a custom white pink and gold shirt. On the day of the party she looked adorable. They quickly became my daughter's favorite pair of shoes. She wanted to play dress-up everyday so she could wear these shoes. She has several princess costumes that they paired well with. They are beautiful and don't look cheap, but literally after only a month and a half of having them the straps tore off at the seam. My daughter was sorely disappointed. She didn't play outside in them cuz we didn't categorize them as \"play\" shoes. She primarily wore them inside and to church or other functions where she needed to dress appropriately. They were great while they lasted, they just didn't last long even with easy use. I'm glad we got them for her birthday because they went perfectly with the princess theme, but I wouldn't purchase them for wearing to school or for everyday wear. And if you do decide to purchase them I'd watch your little one closely in them, cuz when the strap broke on one of the shoes the other shoe got caught in them and my daughter got pretty banged up in the fall. And all she was doing was walking from our living room to her bedroom. Smh. So disappointed these didn't last longer.", "summary": "Cute but didn't last long...", "unixReviewTime": 1469577600}

Shipping was EXTREMELY fast coming from China. I ordered these from an individual vendor not Amazon. So for grid work or just some pretty stones these are great.

I ordered two sets of these, each in different letters, so I could use one of each for my first and last initials.  I know, I know, they offer these as singles as well as pairs, but since the single links aren't on Amazon Prime, the shipping makes the singles almost the same price as a pair. So (for only a couple dollars more) I purchased two pair, like I said, in case I ever lose one.  Now the problem: The letters aren't the same size.  Yes, each pair matches its mate (an \"A\" matches the other \"A\", for example), but doesn't necessarily match any other letter in size (letter \"A\" is different than letter \"B\"). The boxes they arrived in were even slightly different, leading me to believe they might be manufactured in different places for the same company.

I love this wallet, I've been using it for about a half of a year, I carry it in my front right with my pens and my car keys, so it sees a bit more abuse than if it was by itself. I got a light brown/tan version of it. It looks very very nice. Its clean, minimal. no real frills example a logo stamped into the leather on the inner left. there is a nice little outside pocket on the wallet which I use for my school ID. Easily able to pull from it and put back in without removing the entire wallet.\nIts very very nice. I love it. The leather is nice, and its held up very nicely. The only complaints I have are the fact it is very short height wise, so it can't hold a standard receipt in it without it sticking out. Another issue I have had is the inside of the bill pocket, the seam splitting a bit, so the leather that wraps around to the inside of the bill pocket was flapping around. It was mostly a nuisance so I super glued it back down. There is only three card slots on the left, and then a bit bigger bulk pocket on the inside of it. There is only an id pocket on the right side.\n\nSo in summary\n+Fits front pocket nicely\n+Very no-frills\n+Thin\n+Reasonably Priced\n+Durable, no real ripping. Only issue the bill pocket issue\n-Bill pocket flap issue\n-Not enough slots for cards\n-Can't handle too many bills in the bill pocket before being hard to fold in half (Example 14 twenties makes it harder to bend)", "summary": "Great wallet for your front pocket.", "unixReviewTime": 1429488000}

I performed the same tests with both wallets, using security badge proximity readers of different frequencies and manufacturers--HID systems and S2 systems.  They all went right through this wallet no matter what pouches I put the cards in.  It never blocked a single read attempt.  The old wallet blocked every read every time.\n\nThought I'm hanging onto this as it is a nice brown wallet, I want others to know that if RFID is a requirement, you should pick a different wallet.

So very well made and excellent quality.  Very flattering for my pudgy body.  I ordered the 1x/18W in tall, and it's simply perfect.  For reference, I am 5'10\", about 245 lbs, with a 38DDD-40DD bra size, and usually wear 1x or 18w sizes.  So it was definitely true to size.  The band sits right below the breast, and I measure about 43\" there (for reference).  I've ordered other talls from eshakti, and they were at the floor or even longer (I'll just have a seamstress hem them up for a few bucks), but this dress was just perfect--it just barely grazes my ankles. The adjustable sleeves are great.  The fabric is very soft and flowy--not stiff at all--but substantial enough that I won't need to wear a slip if I don't want to.  I washed this inside out in my washing machine on a gentle cycle, and then dried it on low, and it didn't shrink or anything--took all the shipping wrinkles out, so I didn't have to iron it.\n\nFYI, on eshakti's own website (not their site on amazon), they have zillions more gorgeous dresses, and you can customize each piece to suit you best.  For example, you can ask them to change the length of a knee-length dress to calf-length.  You can just a deep-v neckline to a more shallow neckline, and even change the v-neck to a square or round or such.  You can change the sleeves on many items as well--from sleeveless, to cap sleeves, or short sleeves, etc.  They charge just $8 to do this.\n\nI'm definitely keeping an eye on eshakti's offerings here on amazon as well as on their website.

With so many crystals and such detail, if the workmanship isn't first-rate, the bag could arrive with some \"jewels\" already missing; if the materials aren't excellent, then it could simply look cheap and tacky.  It was a gamble, but one that really paid off.  I was absolutely delighted to open the package and find such a lovely, elegant bag.  Every crystal was intact (and the manufacturer also provides a little plastic bag with some replacement crystals -- just in case.)  I am planning on pairing this bag with a black evening suit -- a little jolt of drama to raise the outfit to something special. And now, to practicalities.  With all the crystals, it is a bit heavier than many other evening bags, though not, in my opinion, to a negative degree.  Also, the interior is smallish.

Very few alterations were necessary but one thing I didn't understand and didn't see in the picture for Gorgeous Bridal (I did see it in the pictures of what appeared to be the same dress but from a different vendor) was a netting along the neckline.  Luckily it was something that my seamstress could do a little cutting and tucking and made it disappear.

This purse is not too rigid and it fits snugly and comfortably on the shoulder. My Fossil was rigid and I would constantly be 'bumped into', in a crowd. That has not happened with this soft nylon. The sides can be cinched--in, as needed, with the tassels as well. The color is a rich brown and goes with most anything.\nThe inside is amazing and just what I was hoping for. Two sides to the inside with the divider-zipped pocket in the middle. The middle pocket is large. To one side of the middle pocket is a large open area with a cell-phone pocket (fits an iphone 5 perfectly) and another zippered (albeit smaller) pocket on the outside wall. The other (interior) side also has a large open area with four open pockets along the outside wall with three spots (additionally) for pens, pencils or lip gloss. Enough room for sunglasses, reading glasses, coupons, gum, etc. The magnetic closer is strong and stays closed--even with a lot in the purse. At different times, I may carry a water bottle, ipad, papers to and from work, a large wallet--this purse handles it all.\nThis purse is well-designed and well-made. I expect to have it for a long time. The leather handles on my Fossil began to break down over the last year, which makes me question the quality of materials used. This is my fourth Dooney & Bourke and I don't know why I ever strayed with my last purchase--it won't happen again.\nThanks to Amazon, the authenticity is real and the delivery was as expected....no worries.", "summary": "This is a nice purse--you won't be disappointed.", "unixReviewTime": 1427155200}

I figured it would be a consistent match as they were titled the same Active Basic Long Camis in Large w/ Built-in Shelf Bra. Boy, was that a wrong assumption. They weren't even Active Basic brand but the sellers own & they didn't have a shelf bra but two foam pads sewn in a sling that after one washing was a wadded up mess.

They fit great & all was well until my back began to hurt from a scratching chaff. Turns out on comparing these to the first ones I bought, these have the elastic straps sewn in backwards so the scratchy heavy duty thread that binds the straps to the halter in back along with the tacked down material rubs against the shoulder blades. The first ones bought have the straps tacked down facing the halter away from the skin. I don't know why consistency is a problem but I cant seem to get proper Active Basic Camis.

It is not even symmetrical.) the middle is the item in I purchased most recently (and the item for this review), and the far right is my original.  (The blue soul gem was my first and favorite purchase, but the blue soul gem's metal is now turning green. [very very sad face]  )\n\nI'm not so fond of the default chain that comes with this item [green soul gem], but now that I've worn it a few times, I'm not seeing any signs of the metal turning green.  (All of the other cosplay soul gems I've had up until now ended up turning green, and there was not a whole lot I could do about it.)  This purchase (green soul gem) is the first necklace that is clearly not made out of cheap metal.  You can still see the casting lines where the metal came together.  (Actually, the top of the necklace doesn't really line up with the casting lines on the bottom.  So the green one isn't really 100% symmetrical, either.)\n\nI found another chain that compliments the necklace a bit more.  (The chain I replaced it with looks more ornate, I think.)\n\nThis green soul gem up for review comes off a bit more gaudy where it's so much larger.  I don't get as many compliments on this item as I did when I wore my original blue necklace.  (The smaller blue one is something I purchased at Colossalcon in Sandusky, Ohio back in 2012 in person.)\n\nTruthfully, even after my green soul gem was delivered, I still will opt to wear my blue soul gem sometimes.  It looks more delicate, and has a less subtle feel to it.\n\nThe coin in the photo is for scale, and it is a dime from the 1940s (Mercury dime).  It's the same size as a regular dime.\n\nThe box in the background came with the cheap yellow soul gem off of eBay.  The eBay one came with matching rings, and 4 other different color soul gems for about $20.00.\n\nI'm still trying to find a really wicked looking Grief Seed.  So far, no luck.

Granted, I have only tried them on and worn them around the house for a few hours, but it seems like these would sag in the crotch area if I were walking around any more than around my (small) apartment. The waist is pretty high, up to the bottom of my rib cage/2-3\" above my belly button, and I have a long torso. They have a nice, wide waistband that doesn't cut in at all, but also doesn't help keep them in place. I ended up folding the waistband over because they came up so high, and that sort of helped reduce crotch-sag.\n\nFor reference, I'm 5'8\"/125-130lbs with a 24\" waist and 38\" hips. I ordered the M/L because of my height, and because that was the range I definitely \"should\" be in.

However, when the orders came in, and I opened the package and saw my jewelry.....all of it......I was so pleasantly surprised.  All of it was beautiful, great quality, fit perfectly, and priced well.  I loved everything I received, over 100 jewelry pieces, rings, earrings, necklaces, bracelets.  I wear it too.  I get compliments on all of it.  Some of the pieces are for evening wear, so I can't wear it to work.  I did not have to return a thing.  Well, that's why I work.

The size of the waist looks like a CHILDRENS.  The sweatshirt can work if NOT to busty; seems like a small to med.  The jacket seems small to med also.\n\nIt isn't nearly as bulky as it looks.  The material isn't soft like some of the matierials today, but its substantial so it seems like it will be very warm.  The only other drawback is the jacket LINING (the orange shown in the pic) is opaque and weak.  It may RIP AWAY from grey fabric after a few washings.  No washing instructions.  No tags of any kind except one item that reads \"XXL,\" on another item it reads \"3,\" other item the tag is cut off.\n\nThe size of the model and her clothes size would have been very helpful.\n\nThe outfit is so cute with all three pieces together.  We would have ordered every color if the SIZING wasn't so far off and the jacket lining so thinly stiched to fabric.  There is no 3XL or 4XL to buy.  This may be good fit for kids.\n\nLastly, this review had nothing to do with the delivery time being lengthy because it read so before we ordered it.", "summary": "Way, way, way SMALL !", "unixReviewTime": 1443657600}

I was impressed with how substantial the material feels - not cheap or thin or flimsy feeling.  The waist comes a little higher than I am used to, but I think they actually look better/more slimming on me for that reason.  And they are truly comfortable.  I did feel the charcoal color was just a tad darker than I had expected, but the pants ended up being the perfect shade of gray to match a gray blazer I wanted to wear with them.  Finally, I am 5'6\", and at first I thought I was going to have to hem the length, but when I put the pants on with dress shoes, which have about a 1\" heel, I decided that they would be fine.  But anyone shorter than me might have to hem them; anyone a few inches shorter than me might want to order the \"short\" size.\n\nI do wish they had pockets (all the pockets are faux); I wore them to an all-day conference/networking event and had nowhere to stash my phone, card wallet, or business cards when I wasn't going far and didn't want to carry my purse.  I also find it a little bit difficult to tuck in a shirt without a zipper, but I guess that's part of why they are so comfortable.  I do recommend them overall though, and will probably buy them in more colors in the future.\n\nUpdate: I have changed my rating from four stars to three because of how high the waist is in addition to them not having pockets.  The high waist line is visible through slinky, loosely form-fitting shirts, and many of my shirts don't look good tucked in either.  The kind of shirt that looks best is the kind that's loose with an elastic bottom.  The point is these pants haven't turned out to be as versatile as I'd hoped. :/", "summary": "Wish they had pockets and a lower waistline", "unixReviewTime": 1471219200}

IT IS GORGEOUS!!! So much sparkle and shine, it looks very real. The stones are the perfect size. Not too small, but not so big they look fake. They have a lot of fire and catch your eye in the sunshine or indoors. The band is also very nice and well made. The only thing I could think that I would do differently if I could design a ring myself would be to add a little something on the side under the main setting, like a little bezel set sapphire. But I am very happy with this ring!\n\nUpdate....\nWithin a few days of wearing the ring I noticed that it had a loose stone. I didn't want to send it back to have it replaced because it already had sentimental value so I paid out of pocket to have it fixed. A few weeks later another stone was loose. I contacted the company about it and they were little to no help. So I ended up paying out of my pocket AGAIN to have it fixed and make sure that the last stone was in there tight. Very disappointed with the quality and customer service about this issue. Don't buy from them!", "summary": "Pretty ring but it had a loose stone", "unixReviewTime": 1481068800}

I did notice that, but when I looked at the button holes, I noticed some of them were stitched a little more than others.

It's what I'm bringing for a mountain getaway of 3 days and 2 nights in Taiwan. The main compartment was packed full with the clothing and the Bluetooth speaker. The back is where I put the tablet, though I wish there is actually a padded compartment for it.\n\nPro:\nExcellent built quality - the bag is as thick and well-built and beautiful in person as it is in the photo.\nThe various compartments were perfect for my organization of the trip.\nThe zippers seemed to be of good quality.\nPacking was easy because the sides of the main compartment was very sturdy and stout.\nIt's light-weight: 2 pounds! Even with the bag filled full, it did not feel heavy when I lifted it.\nThe paddings on the back are super comfortable, and the straps are very well-built!\n\nCon:\nI hate that I must undo the top handle buttons in order to access any of my larger compartments.\nThe weight of the packed bag pulls from my shoulder and back - chest and waist straps would solve that problem. If this bag had those, I'd keep it, hands down. Otherwise, I know it will be painful once I have to deal with it during long walks through the city and mountains.\n\nI could probably fit a foldable hairdryer in there but I don't have one right now - I plan on buying one soon.\n\nConclusion?

At only 1.1lbs., this is a well constructed, ultralight rectangular bag. In October I asked if they could be zipped together and another reviewer answered me \"yes\". Threes months after posting the question, I  purchased  two to zip together and use as a double bag in my 68 vw camper bus as bedding. However, the ends of the zipper feeds into the fabric and is not possible.  Although they do not, Aegis chose to not correct the wrong answer given, even after 3 months.  Hence the 4, rather than 5 star rating.\n  Even though I can not use them as I intended, I chose to keep them to use for backpacking. I have been using them in my hammock outside almost every day since they arrived. I absolutely love the versatility of having two bags. I can use one as an under quilt or stuff one inside the other for use as a colder weather bag, and they still feel roomy when used this way.  The fabric is soft and I just love the color- not army green or primary colors like most of the better bags out there. If you happen to let them hit the ground, the leaves and forest debris will not stick to the fabric- easy to keep clean on a hike. They fluff out with a simple shake. I am 6'0\", 145lbs and I fit completely inside- lying down straight the fabric reaches above my face, and I do not feel constricted at all.\n  So backpackers and hikers, if you're looking for a ultralight, rectangular, summer bag, you'll be a happy camper. But if you're shopping for\nrectangular bags you can combine for a double, keep looking.", "summary": "A Backpacker's Dream! But beware they DO NOT ZIP TOGETHER!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1460246400}

When we got on the cruise, I simply unrolled it, spritzed it with some wrinkle reducer and it was ready for dinner only a few hours later. While on our trip, I did wash the dress once while in the shower, squeezed it out good then rolled it in a towel and stepped on it a bit. Then I hung the dress out on the balcony for a nighttime drying (after all, you're usually sailing at night and in the middle of the ocean, so who's around to complain?), and it was COMPLETELY dry by morning.\n\nI will DEFINATELY buying another for later travels!", "summary": "Spectacular Travel Dress", "unixReviewTime": 1416009600}

However, they don't quite fit.  I ordered the regular small because I'm usually a 6.5-7 in shoes depending on the brand.  These are a bit large for me, like half a shoe size to even a shoe size too big.  I had my grandmother try it on to see how it fit (she's a 7.5) and she said it was tight.  Either I'm more of a 6.5 according to this shoe or it's just made not for my foot shape.\nFor the price I will keep them because I really love them; Rainbow Dash is my favorite pony and these shoes are comfortable.  I put a Dr. Scholl's in it to take up some space and am keeping the tissue that the shoe came with inside the shoes to fill up the end so that my feet don't fall out.  Without socks my feet are coming up and out of the shoe constantly, and with socks they still didn't fit so that has been my solution.\nI wish the sizes that were listed were more true to themselves and a little more detailed as to what shoe size they fit.  I chose the Small over the Small (7-8), but now I wonder if I should've gone with that size.  Only get this shoe size if you know you're a 7 or 7.5 in shoes normally, not someone who fluctuates solely based on brand between 7 and 6.5 because it didn't fit me.\n\nThe video in my review shoes me first trying on a shoe as is and showing that when I walk it comes off and doesn't fit.  Then I show the second shoe and the amendments I made to it to make it fit, and show me walking in it and it not slipping off.\n\nThe colors are great, the shoes came in great condition, but the sizing was too big for me without mending them myself.", "summary": "20% Cooler with 20% Amendments", "unixReviewTime": 1464912000}

I was hoping for kind of a casual no thought put into it kind of look and I find myself feeling rather \"large\" and uncomfortable in it. It's made of a softer yarn? And feels nice against the skin but I do recommend a tank or t-shirt b worn under it. Finally although nice it doesn't seem like it's nicely made (if that makes sense). I have only hand washed it (in cold water) and lay it out to dry and even with extreme care it seems to easily unravel and after maybe 3 washes it looks pretty shabby.

The fit was great, I ordered a medium which is my normal clothing size and it did fit me correctly. I also thought the material of everything was good- better than a many costumes I've bought in the past. Could see this being worn more than once, unlike some costumes- which was a big plus for me!\n\nThe things that did bother me were the size of the bandana. I definitely have a normal sized head but this bandana was not a full sized bandana, I couldn't use it because it was just too small. I sort of jerry-rigged it to barely function but just ended up taking it off before my day was over.\n\nBesides that, I did feel like the neckline was A LOT lower than pictured. I chalked it up to having a smaller chest than the model but double sided tape was definitely needed in order to conceal my bra. It just seemed like it sat a lot wider and deeper than what is pictured on the model.\n\nI was also tricked by the sleeves. I zoomed in multiple times mulling over my options before deciding to buy this costume and not once did I realize that the sleeves are rolled up in the picture. So, if you're expecting a 3/4 length sleeve like I was, be warned the sleeves are full, long sleeves. Not a big deal to me, but not what I was expecting. I honestly thought they were 3/4 length and cuffed.", "summary": "Not exactly as expected", "unixReviewTime": 1416528000}

Proportions of US women (meaning all our various genetic traits that we physically show) are no where close to those of asian culture peoples.  Our inseam is longer so most of these sweater tights will not fit most of us as intended.  If you are a petite US or asian culture woman then you will most likely be able to enjoy the fit of these types of tights.  For the rest of us who are not petite but a normal (meaning h/wt proportionate) for our heights will find these types of tights to be very short in the inseam/crotch area but fit in other respects.  some of these (for example; footless variations like the ones seen here) tights can be manipulated to be worn by pulling them up short to fit the crotch area but there are other trade-offs for doing so.  If you're like me and really like the idea of sweater tights; footless or footed you'll need to get over the idea of \"saving a ton of money\" when you see these listed in places like ebay or amazon for under $8  when you really want something like this to fit the way its designed to fit.  Instead, you'll need to \"suck it up\" and expect to pay a bit more for sweater tight that fit as advertised; brands like HUE etc.  the best thing you can do is go to your local dept store and try on some various brands as some fit better than others.  If pricing is still an issue after trying on you can often times go to the manufacturer website and order direct.  Otherwise you'll find yourself like me, wearing a pair like the ones seen here and ordered for less than $5 but pulled up so high they are no longer heeled/toe-less sweater tights but instead capris that do fit, snuggly and no doubt stretching this very durable material to what I estimate is its max threshold, with a hole where the heel would have sat had they fit as advertised for a US woman body.  I think if they didn't have that long-john underwear U on the seat they might actually fit as advertised for most US women.  in summation, if you are not a petite woman of any nationality avoid this product and others like it, instead buy what you know fits from having tried them on at a dept store near you.  you'll save yourself a lot of disappointment and frustration with overseas sellers who really don't understand why their product isn't working for US buyers.  If you purchased these tights and they don't fit consider making your own long sock or over the knee sock out of them as most of them do not roll down and if they do you're still trendy as slouchy socks are in too!  of course you can gift them but why when you can still use them as the re-purposed sock that is custom made to the length you need for your socks.\n\nif money is still a concern you can try buying off season like I did.  Most dept stores start season resets earlier and earlier so I was able to find several pairs of thermal tights that fit in addition to finding sweater tights that fit.  Also, there is a difference between sweater and knit tights.  knit tights are more of a thick nylon hosiery where sweater tights are indeed thicker than nylon but very stretchy and very much a textile instead of nylon hosiery.", "summary": "Buy sweater tight brands you know fit from having tried them on first.

When I first pulled it out of the bag I said to myself, nope, that's never going to fit me. Disappointed with the way it looked not to fit, I didn't try it on. After about an hour of sulking I decided what do I have to loose. Well, it fit...but it fit like it was tailored. Not that tailored is bad but with a coat you like a little wiggle room. Wearing this with a fine dress will look amazing. Now it was shorter than it looks in the picture. It comes to the middle of my shin and I am short...about 5'2 and about 107 pounds. The coat was a little thinner than I expected and the black trim is not solid like I thought. The black trim is lace like...not bad...just not what I was expecting. The biggest thing I can tell everyone about this coat is that if your not a small frame female...and I mean small frame...this coat will not fit you.

If I'm being honest I would probably wear this hat myself. But I'm never that cold. I live in a climate with 2 basic seasons, hot and scorching.  To my children that get up and leave the house bright and early for school, if it's not scorching it's cold. So I figured my girls would get some use out of this hat.  My six year old is very eccentric and likes to stand out so I figured this would be perfect for her. Besides she is my animal lover. So I gave it to her and she gasped with excitement, literally. She put on the hat and could not stop playing with the braided strings.  She was outside playing and the hat stayed in place. I can see it's a little big but it's not floppy or sloppy looking.\n\nThe hat i very well made and the material was thicker than I expected. The cool kitty on the front is not a sticker or something that will fall off over time. It's part of the material so it's there to stay. The braids have frayed bottoms but there is a knot to stop the frays from raveling up the braid.  Although the material is thick the hat is lightweight. The fact that the inside is lined with a soft felt material helps keep my daughter's head extra warm. Over all I'm very pleased with the look and quality of this hat. I love all the different styles available!\nI received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion but the opinion expressed is all my own.", "summary": "Super cute, well made, keeps you warm", "unixReviewTime": 1445472000}

As for the length, this jacket will not go past the waistline of your pants, which is strange considering it's meant to be worn on a motorcycle (you're in a prone position). Ah well. So let's get past the sizing topic and onto the quality of the jacket.\n\nIt's a bit noisy, like sitting on leather furniture. The zippers don't look the most durable, BUT, I'm sure they'll do the job just fine. I am a little curious about the pockets - they zip closed to keep with the slim shape, but they're very difficult to access. It's awkward for me because I'm so used to putting my hands in the two side pockets of my coat.

It is light and does not have a full zip-closure, but has a satin lining and the plaid is a soft fleece.

The length falls to my mid-thighs, so it will keep my entire torso covered and warm. The sleeves are a little short, which might be a problem for some people, especially if short-sleeves are a common issue for you. For me however I ALWAYS have the problem of too-long sleeves so these nice short ones are welcomed. I can move around in the jacket and the sleeves don't get in the way.

It was an evening wedding and past his bedtime, so we specifically wanted something that we could just put him straight to bed in when we got back to the hotel. It worked perfectly for what we wanted and looked quite cute. It's as comfortable as any onsie outfit but manages to look like a suit. Our son is right at the 50th percentile mark for height and weight, and it just barely fit to snap up at the crotch, so I strongly recommend buying a size up for an averaged sized kid. When he had his 15-month growth spurt he no longer fit in it, and I have seen others mention the size is small. The pants didn't go to the ankle, but I'm not sure if that's a style thing or just a sizing issue. He still received many \"cute\" and \"adorable\" comments, so that isn't a big issue to me. If you do buy a larger size, you'll likely have to roll the sleeves a bit, as they were almost long. The only real problem for us we had was keeping the bow in place. I'd recommend taking a needle and thread to it to quick-stitch it in place, as it slips out easily. It went through the washer and dryer a few times without problems or noticeable shrinking (he outgrew it pretty quickly, so we only washed it two or three times).  We ordered it a month in advance, as the possible shipping time was fairly long when we bought it. It came in plenty of time. The price was better than most outfits for kids this age.\n\nIs it fancy? No.\nIs it cute? In my opinion, absolutely!\nWill a person wanting something that looks expensive like it? No, you don't get expensive-looking at this price unless something is on sale.\nWould I buy it again? Yes, but in a larger size and early enough that I don't have to sweat the delivery time.\n\nOverall, I was quite pleased with it and am glad I didn't spend mountains of money on a suit for a wedding.", "summary": "Cute, very inexpensive, not fancy, just a bit small on sizing.", "unixReviewTime": 1470700800}

You could get a larger loop that would fit around the necklace,  and hook it through the pendant's existing loop. Or you could get a new chain to go through the pendant. However, this is exactly the sort of small thing that I personally won't do for months. I contacted seller about this, but they said the necklace was a free gift, so, no guarantees.

I don't often order clothes online because I like to see how they are going to fit, first. But this flowy circle blouse looked comfortable, so I decided to try it. It arrived much sooner than promised, so that was a bonus. But the fact that this blouse is absolutely one of the most perfect t-shirts/blouse pieces I've ever bought is what's best. First, it came true to size. I ordered an x-large and it fits perfectly. Next, the material is soft and ultra-comfortable, and it does flow, just like it says in the ad. Third, I like that it does this without showing your underwear under your arms. So many times you sacrifice your bodesty to get blouses like this. But with this top, modesty isn't a problem. It's really cool how your arms have freedom to move, the blouse is flowy, and it just feels beautiful. Last but not least, I like how it sits on my hips. It's not too short, and not too long, and the way it's made makes it look like it was fitted just for me. I like it.

The straps are about an inch wide, I think that they are the perfect width. The only thing that I didn't like is that you can slightly see through it.

Its great to layer with other tops as well. I really like the color that I picked out, I think that it is a very pretty and vibrant color.

I sleep in tank tops and I wear a tank top practically every day.  So I guess I would call myself a Tank Top Expert -- if there was such a thing.  I absolutely love this tank top. It is so soft and comfy -- I would wear it every day if I could.\n\nThere are several things that I really like about this tank top. It is super soft -- you can tell that it is ringspun cotton vs the standard cotton. Being ringspun makes it super soft.  I also really like that it is made with a little bit of spandex because I like my tanks to fit naturally. I also really like that this is a longer tank -- it drives me nuts when my tanks ride up over my belly -- really, who wants to see that? This really fits and feels great.\n\nThe only thing that I don't like is that the tag is a bit itchy and scratchy.  There are two sewn in tags on the neckline -- one for the brand and one for care instructions.  After reading the instructions on how to wash and care for this fabric I simply cut both tags out - problem solved.  I would prefer sewn in tags to be on the side seam but that is just my personal preference.  Overall this is a great tank and I would buy one in every color if I could.  Also, I don't know why the description states this is ribbed because the material is smooth and doesn't have a ribbed texture -- you can see how smooth the material is when you zoom in on the listing picture.\n\nI really like this tank top and would highly recommend it.

I chose the latter.  Each lightweight strap goes up where it splits into two separate straps like a \"y\" which each has a button slide on the end.  This is actually much easier than it sounds, I am just trying to paint a picture with words.  You slide the button out and then back in with the shirt over the slide button,--- it is very easy.  However, you must use a little pressure to slide the button all the way back in so that it won't slip back out.\nThe adjustable slide metal tab is certainly functional.  You flip it up, slide the strap to whatever length suits your leg length and flip it securely back into place.\nI also suggest attaching them to your shirt before putting it on.\nAt first, I was reluctant to purchase because of the other two reviews but decided to determine for myself.  I am glad that I did.\n$24.99 for the pair is a bit pricey but I like my shirt stays.

I absolutely love the idea and the design behind this hat, but there are a few flaws in this one that need to be pointed out. Do not get me wrong it is a great buy for the price, but it still does have a few issues. So this cap is made of denim. It has a distressed design to it with the tears in the bill of the hat, which are super cute. There is a red pattern underneath the tears, which makes it look really cute. The USA on the hat are actually iron on black patches of material that have the rhinestones hot glued on. You can see the glue trails on and around the stones and hat. The black material is lifting around some of the edges just a little, but that little bit can easily turn into a lot later when this happens. The stones are dull. I am not sure if this is on purpose or they are just worn. They are not stones either, sorry about that, they are plastic stone like pieces, which is fine with me. The hat does look super cute but those are items that you might want a little more detail on. The part that concerns me is the adjustable strap on the back of the hat. It is a thinner faux leather type material that really looks like it will tear or break easily. I have adjusted it to my head and do not plan on messing with that part in the future if I can help it. Overall is really is a super cute hat. Just be aware of those details before deciding to purchase. I only plan to wear this one a few times a year so it is perfect for me. I received this hat at a discounted price to give my honest review and this is my honest review of the Deer Mum Ladies Denim Jean Campagne Bling USA/Other Characters Pattern Adjustable Baseball Cap .", "summary": "I absolutely love the idea and the design behind this hat", "unixReviewTime": 1468368000}

Also, the nice draping in the front, shown in the picture, is damn near impossible to replicate in that there just isn't enough fabric.\nGood luck ladies.", "summary": "Interesting...", "unixReviewTime": 1414022400}

In no way is this a \"slim fit\" sweatshirt.  I've purchases some other similarly styled products and most aren't as extreme as this.  I'm 5'7\" and 180 lbs without any gut and have large arms so I went with the XL (US large) based on reviews of others, even though I usually wear a US medium.\n\nThe arm length was pretty much perfect, as was the shoulder width.  The length of the body was slightly longer than expected, but not by much.  Having larger than usual arms for someone my size, I expected them to fit a little on the tighter side.  They were a bit tighter than would normally be expected from a US medium, which means they were very small for a US large equivalent.  Despite the reasonable length of the body, the girth was ridiculously large.  Despite being a US large equivalent, the girth of the body would be on the large side for a US X-large.\n\nOverall fit is slim-fit US medium arms attached to a relaxed fit US X-large body with US medium sized shoulder width.\n\nConstruction\n-------------------------\nI've purchased other products with a similar fit and branding, but this is probably the shoddiest construction I've seen.  The material is warm but not very durable, and the zippers are cheap plastic.  Only the zipper pull is made of metal, the block at the bottom of the zipper is extra cheap plastic.  The shoulder seams are very terrible design, not being patterned like a normal shirt or sweatshirt but having a folded corner.  With the low quality shoulder seam design it looks forever like you're trying to hide small horns growing out of the top of your shoulders.\n\nMisc\n--------------------------\nThere are 3 zippers other than the main one on this sweatshirt, and two of them go to pockets (there's no breast pocket).  The pockets are pretty decent sized, and because the material is on the thinner side they don't really add additional bulk to the sweatshirt.  The zippers are made of the same zipper material as the main one (terrible low quality), but they do have stops on them so you can't completely unzip them accidentally and be unable to zip them closed again.  The problem is that while the pockets are rather large, the whole to get into them is really tiny.  I don't have particularly large hands for a 5'7\" guy, but I can only get 3 fingers into the pocket opening.  The pockets being large actually means they're useless to me since my three fingers can't reach anything I might have put in the pockets.  If you had miniscule hands you might be able to get your whole hand in one of these pockets, but that's it.", "summary": "Not slim-fit, gigantic fat-fit with tiny arms.

For me, I use a little tea tree stimulating growth oil and some jamaican black castor oil and Ganier Fructis Heal and Seal Treatment to help a bit, you only need a little if you want to use these that is, and I ran my fingers through the wig. I let it hang on the door for a few hours and, every now and then brush it and once fully dryed. Use flat irons on a safe setting lets say 350. You don't want it too too hot, it will melt. Then finish it off with light hair spray. I use to work at a beauty supply store, and dealt with a lot of wigs. You can use your own methods, this one worked for me. Also if your unsure, use Youtube.

I was worried that it might have been too bright and eye catching, which I didn't want particularly, but I can see now that it's actually printed on the fabric rather than a graphic transfer so I also don't have to worry about the pattern eventually peeling off. The only thing that I wasn't expecting, which you probably can't see in the photo, is that there is a mesh strip on either side of the pattern that extends up to the fabric for the arms and hood, and it's only on the front side.

This has the fingers cut and thought these would be a good touch to have the fingers out.

Unsuspecting, we drove miles back to our place, got ready for bed, half asleep I hear her question where her ring is after she left the bathroom. We searched the entire room, drains, hallway, lobby, car than thought, what if it is back in town somewhere?  We frantically drove into the rainy little town with the windshield wipers blazing. With a flash light I peered through the locked windows and doors of all the shops and restaurants we visited that night. No luck. After 30 mins,  I than said lets retrace the walk back to the car from earlier. There and behold, in the middle of the dark, wet side walk, half glimmering in the puddle of the cobble stone sidewalk...  My flash light picked up a sparkle just edging out of the crevice of rain water. I froze in relief. There it was, in the middle of the sidewalk, in a puddle at a little small town intersection! We still thank the powers to be...unreal!!!!  What are the odds.

The color will probably not outlast the shoe, especially since it is slightly big for her. She does seem very comfortable in them and will ask to wear her \"birks\".

The material feels great, and the cut is done nicely.  I'll be ordering more, for sure.\n\nWhen I do though, I'll pay more attention, and you should as well.  Some underwear sellers tell you to order your regular size and they will size-up for you.  (You order small and they will send you Medium, because it's labeled Asian size and their medium is our small).  Other sellers tell YOU to order one bigger.  That's the case here.  I wear small, so I ordered small.  I got SMALL.  And they kinda really are...!!  (Even for my 29\" waist)  *sigh*... Lol\nI can get them on without it feeling like I'm constricting anything, but I'm going to be ordering a couple more pairs in a size Medium.  :-)\n\n**second EDIT**  The size medium pair showed up a few weeks ago and they're perfect.

I searched and found these O-pouch low rise briefs, and OH! is right.\nThe photo displays a pack of 7, which is inexpensive and covers the whole week for not a lot of money. Each pair came wrapped in its own little pouch. The fabric is a breathable mesh that is airy without being drafty. I wear a 34\" inseam, and ordered the XL (US Large) and the fit is superb. Now, the OH. The front flap flips up to reveal a circle through which the whole team shines. I put these on, and I feel like I am wearing nothing. They are just what I wanted in an underwear to go quasi-commando. I don't even feel the elastic in the legs. They fit just below the navel, so that when I wear my Old Navy jeans, I don't have to worry about feeling my briefs (yeah, I'm still looking at you Hanes).\nI am happy with this purchase. I now have two favorites. The David Archy micromodal separate pouch, for when I am feeling a little bit naughty, and these, for when I wanna \"rock out with my...\" (you know the rest).

I planned to use this as an alternative to a handbag and wanted something semi-professional looking so I could take it into work. However, I have only had this bag for less than one month and have two issues with it. The first issue is that the leather has begun to tear down where the straps meet (see pic) on both sides. I typically carry a small wallet, two sets of keys, and a cell phone in it. I do not use this for heavy items, so I am disappointed that it is beginning to come apart so soon. The second issue is that the zipper is now beginning to fail. When I go to zip up the bag, I have noticed that sometimes the other side of it will split. This is obviously a big safety issue since you wear it on your back and cannot always tell when the zipper has split and your belongings are unprotected. I have managed to fix this problem at times by sliding the zippers back all the way to the other side and jamming them down with some force and then rezipping them again, but this is an issue that continues to happen.", "summary": "I loved this bag right when I got it", "unixReviewTime": 1420416000}

I tried to pull the hood back a little which worked for about 5 seconds until it fell forward and blocked my eyes again.  I am glad that the fur is detachable.", "summary": "Great winter coat!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1422835200}

However, this is quite the sweet little swimmer-stle, low slung jockstrap, and it is way more comfortable than I thought it would be when it arrived. Like the other Chinese \"fashion\" jockstraps I've purchased, it quite comfortably provides the support I need without leaving me feeling crowded. Amazon kindly and wisely automatically \"upsizes\" this particular style, and a Large fits my 32\" waist and other bits like a glove.\n\nThe most recent ones I ordered are a cool grey-green colour and, aside from the contrasting white stripes on the leg straps, there's also a white seam (piping?) that runs down the middle of the pouch, adding another nice visual effect. Made of an open-weave poly material, much like American football uniforms, this cute comfy jockstrap is both breathable and  stretchable and, like my classic style jocks, it holds up well to a day of work AND a hard workout at the end of the day. Just don't throw 'em in the \"sturdy dirty\" load with the rest of your workout gear, Guys.
