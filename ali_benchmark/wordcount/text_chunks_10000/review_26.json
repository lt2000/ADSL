I brought the exact same kind a few months ago and this one is by far a lot better quality.

This one though has the jersey material on the front, then the back it made up of stretchy elastic. When I first received this top I thought that it may be too small, but it stretches a lot and I could see it fitting someone who is a medium/large. The only thing though is that the elastic does get uncomfortable after wearing it all day, but I mean like morning to night all day, not just a couple of hours. Also, the padding in the bra is removable, which might make it more comfortable, but I haven't tried it without the padding yet. This top is also a lot more conservative then some of the same style. The neck line goes up higher then I expected and the shoulder straps are thicker then my other one. This gives the top really good support, and although I wouldn't trust it working out or hiking, for day to day use this is perfect and reliable.

The back of the bra offers up some great support so that's a plus. The fabric itself is not great. About something you'd expect to buy at Forever 21.\n\nThe front where the cups are--small. They covered about half of my breast. The padding DOES come out! Top right and left corner of the inside of the bra is where you can remove and insert the padding.\n\n I personally prefer no padding. I really do love this bra. This would go perfect underneath a large shirt. The design is super cute. In another life where I'm not big chested and nursing I'd wear this all the the time. In any case, it'll be a cute gift for my sister.\n\n***Please rate my review as \"Helpful\" if it helped you because it helps me too! :) Thanks!

I wanted this as a shoulder bag and thought I wouldn't like the handles, but I've found that the handles make it much easier to open the purse and don't detract from the purses looks at all.  Since this purse is fashionably understated, it can go with everything I have from casual to just short of full formal, which makes this a super-plus for me...and, since it is such a unique bag, I won't be seeing it coming and going off everyone's arm.

The one downside to that visor length is it invites the baby's flailing arms or swiveling head to knock the whole hat right off. But I still like it! Just understand usage scenarios: don't strap baby onto you facing TOWARDS you, and always be ready for little hands to pop the thing off at any random time (i.e. be ready to pick it up off the ground (i.e. no Lion King / Circle-of-Life holds while standing over a cliff, on a ship's bow, or riding a roller-coaster...but don't do any of those things anyway!!!)) Use it for what it's best at doing: this hat definitely takes the two prizes 1) for making baby look like a tiny adult, and 2) for maximizing protection from the sun to protect baby from UV...while it's still on the baby's head, at least! If you're looking for a hat with a more balanced visor (shorter and less rigid) that helps protect little eyes while allowing the hat to stay on longer, I highly recommend https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XCY2H1B intead...but still keep baby off roller-coasters :-)", "summary": "for professional-looking babies", "unixReviewTime": 1525132800}

Somehow I found myself with lots of beautiful earings, but no earring backs with which to keep them in place. This age-old dilemma is what set me on my quest to find the perfect pair of reliable earring backs that would fit any--or most--earrings. I first bought some earring backs that made the lofty claim that they would fit any pair of earrings, and were much cheaper, while purporting to do exactly what I needed: fit any pair of earrings without turning my ear green in the process with cheap, sliver-plating. But you get what you pay for, so, not only did my ear end up resembling Kermit the Frog's, I also lost an earring when the \"universal\" earring back slid right off my favorite turquoise earrings. So I decided to search a little harder on Amazon, read more reviews, and come to terms with paying more for something that seems so small and non-essential (to me, anyway). And I am so, so very happy I did!!! The \"World's Most Secure Earring Backs\" are just that--incredibly secure and reliable!! They have not hurt my sensitive ears, and I'm allergic to most metals (I swear I'm not just saying that--I am!). More importantly, they somehow manage to firmly stay put on any pair of earrings that I wear.\n\nI don't claim to understand how the technology works, but I do understand that these are the last replacement earring backs I will ever have to buy!!!

I find it perfect for wearing under tanks and loose/backless tops. I like that it doesn't cut very low in the front so it feels appropriate for layering. One thing to note -- the horizontal straps in the back are attached by a single stitch to the vertical straps, so they don't always lay perfectly flat as they sort of bunch/flip up.

The ones with the trees, cats, etc., have a different bottom edge--it's elasticized at the sides.\n\nThe hands of the models hide the cinching, but the closeups of the hems and rear shots do show it.  This helped me determine that cut of the the pattern that I like would not look flattering on me.

The coloring of the scarf is mostly reds and greens on a white background - floral pattern.\n\nPLEASE remember this is fashion jewelry.

Unfortunately, that's not very helpful or descriptive.  Of course it's shiny and sparkly....that's it's job.  What people really need to know is whether there is some characteristic that makes it difficult  or unenjoyable to wear.  So what I wish someone had made clear to me is how large this bangle is, because it's too large to be comfortable to wear, in my opinion.\n\nThe circumference of bracelet is 8 inches.  Unfortunately, the circumference of my wrist is less than 6 inches, and the size difference makes the bracelet seem clunky and ungraceful on my arm.  I suppose your mileage may vary based on how large your wrist is, and the aspect ratio of it.  In my case, I have slender wrists that also happen to be quite flat, but this bangle is almost as high as it is wide, which means that it stands quite far off my wrist, and gets in the way when I try to type.\n\nIf you're just judging the bracelet on looks, it's nice-looking, but not mind-blowing.  The channel set cubic zirconia do NOT have a lot of fire, so the reflected light is mostly white.  That tells me that they've used okay, but not great, quality CZs.  The bracelet doesn't look particularly real--so you can tell from a mile away that it's a piece of average quality costume jewelry.  To put it in perspective, I'd be okay wearing this with jeans, perhaps, but it's DEFINITELY not something that I would want to wear for a special occasion or gala event.  It's like.....prom jewelry: not very realistic, but fine if you want to glam things up a little.\n\nI'm sure many people will disagree with me---so if this bracelet floats your boat...great. Enjoy it.  But I'd rather read a review that gave me blunt details I can use, rather than overly effusive praise.\n\n---I accepted a sale price on this bracelet in exchange for evaluation and objective review, but it doesn't look anywhere near as good as I'd hoped, and I'm sending it back to Amazon.---", "summary": "Too big for my wrist", "unixReviewTime": 1471046400}

And I'm glad I did.  This is a sturdy leather purse with heavy duty zippers and two large compartments big enough to hold my BIG old leather wallet and diabetes test kit (with insulin and supplies).  These compartments are separated by a zipper compartment that holds my new iPhone (the large one) comfortable, easy to put away and get out when I need it.  There are also two pockets on the inside front (one will hold the small iPhone) and a zipper pocket on the inside back.  On the outside are two zipper compartments, front and back, again with the sturdy zippers.  I love this purse and will purchase another color in the near future.  You will enjoy this purse, too.\n\nNOTE:  I have purchased two more purses like this, one for a friend and one for myself, and love them.  Can't go wrong with this purse!\n\nNOTE:  Almost a year later and my black and brown purse in this style still going strong.  Not even a mark on the bottom.

Is that\nacceptable for you? Thank you so much for your kind understanding.\"\nI don't understand, so I told them they could keep their 30% refund and I would just write a bad review because I still will have to buy another purse.\nI have included a picture.  Other than this defect, the outside of the purse looks great!\n\nI like this purse, but am not overly thrilled about the way it closes.

It's hard to tell about the fit from all the pictures available, with the guy always covering his junk so it's showing how fitting the underwear would be if your hand was in your underwear? Haha, but it's necessary of course because your junk is so darn visible through the mesh. It's so nice to venture into a realm of underwear for play and not for utility, although the breathability of the mesh makes me feel like I'd wear it to work (especially because it gives that 'undercover bad boy' kind of feel that I think I need to get through the boring days). The stitching line in front can be distracting, as in, your junk should be the main focus but what you see is this line down the center. It's whatever, though. The stitching line in the back, however, is nice because it pulls the underwear in a bit between the cheeks, which adds to the separation and definition of your two halves (i.e. it makes your butt look nice). The waist and leg bands have a good feel to them , of a reasonably good quality for the price point. I'd recommend these to people looking for a nice pair of basic fun underwear, just expect to wait for them for like a month if you're ordering in the U.S. Of course, the Asian measurements are bit small, so order up a size.

Drew", "reviewText": "This is a very nice, albeit large, watch and pedometer. I've owned several pedometers over the past few years, and if you're used to all the bells, whistles, and customization that's available in higher-end models, you're not going to be very happy with the basic odometer in this watch. If you are just looking for a basic pedometer/watch combination that is very affordable and very well made, then this should fit the bill.\n\nSteps are only recorded while in pedometer mode, and these are only displayed as steps. There's no conversion to distance. The reason for this is that there's no way to adjust or customize your stride length. You have to remember to turn on pedometer mode when walking or running, or your steps will not be recorded.\n\nThe watch face is approximately 1.75\", the display area being just over 1 inch of that. This means you have a very large and easily readable display. There are four different buttons positioned around the watch. One just turns the light on and off (only the numbers glow, not the entire watch face.)

I have some standard hoop earrings but I wanted something with sparkle. It is actually fairly hard to find something with sparkle in the 2 inch hoop size. I am glad I found these.\n\nThese earrings are SUPER COMFORTABLE on. The backs have the loop closure, you slide them through the holes on your ears into the loop on the back. Then you pinch them closed and they are sort of clip style on the back of pierced ears. I actually really like this style of closure as its easy to put on and take off, taking me less than 3 seconds per ear to get them in. I also don't need a mirror to put them in which is nice.\n\nThe hoops are stunning plated white gold with an alloy base. I find they DO NOT irritate my ears and are very comfortable to wear for extended periods. The white gold SHINES and looks STUNNING. There is no color changing of the metal or itching. My earring holes are very sensitive and I can wear these with ease.\n\nThe crystals go around the whole outer perimeter of the hoops. They are slightly faceted and hit the light beautifully. Major wow-factor. I get a lot of compliments. Great dressy hoops for going out at night. 5/5 stars!\n\nIf you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer!

This is a beautiful bangle bracelet.  First off, the center CZ crystal is huge---I measured approximately 3/8 inch (8mm) edge to edge.  The channel mounted cz-are smaller, about 1/8 (3mm) edge to edge, so that the width of the bracelet is about 3/16 (4-5mm) wide.  The picture (amazon picture) does not do it justice as its much more beautiful when you actually see it.  The center stone, is surrounded on both sides by (I counted) 40 smaller stones (20 on each side).  All of the stones in this bracelet are princess cut--and are very sparkly.  The metal is a hypoallergenic base metal, that is rose colored and very shiny.  The snap lock clasp is very secure and closes flat--so it won't pinch or be uncomfortable in anyway.  I have bought a lot of jewelry and shopped for even more.  I think for the price, the Qianse products are very competitive---and I think based on what I have seen in department stores and Amazon--that for the price you won't find any better.  Its workmanship is superb, and its \"heft\"---its heavy--, finish, and \"eye appeal\" are excellent.  Its beautiful!

It is totally deceptive, does not appear to be a magnifying glass.  However, be aware that it is larger than I had thought it would be from the photos, and rather heavy.  The larger size will actually make it easier for reading, and the weight shows that it is really glass, not a cheap plastic disc, so for some people, these may not be objections at all.  It has a vintage look and will be great with dressier attire, but I had hoped that if a smaller size and less conspicuous, that I could wear it nearly all the time while traveling.  The price was great for such a handy and beautiful pendant so I certainly will find a use for it, though not as I had expected.  The chain is sufficiently long that the magnifying glass is easy to use. Think I'll still look for a smaller pendant for travel.\n\nIf you find this review helpful, please let me know by using the voting buttons.

They are unisex, and this becomes obvious when I put my toes into them. I wear a size 9.5 men's, so my feet aren't that big. It takes actual effort to put them on my toes because of how snugly they fit (which is not the case with my Injinji socks). I predict this is because of the line they had to walk to make them unisex. This is the reason for 4 stars. I feel like adding one more size to the lineup would allow them to adjust both sizes to better fit more people.\n\nOnce on they perform beautifully. They keep my feet dry and add no noticeable bulk inside my shoe. My toes are warmly and softly wrapped and separated (something I really appreciate due to chronic ingrown toenails).\nThey seem built to last about as long as you'd expect an average pair of socks to, so no quality issues to be seen.\n\nOverall, this is a good, fairly inexpensive, pair of socks.

The Triangl swimsuits have orange neoprene on the inside of the bottoms and the cups of the top, where these have black neoprene there but I love the material and in fact I don't see why there any bad reviews. All my friends thought that this swimsuit was a real triangle so it does look like it and it feels comfortable the clip is easy to use different, but easy to use so I hope this helps and right now I'm actually going back to eBuddy on Amazon to get another swimsuit. My only complaint would be that sometimes I do get a camel toe :-/", "summary": "LOVE IT I'm getting another one", "unixReviewTime": 1438128000}

It's easy to set and it gives you the option of 12 or 24 hour time. You can also set the date and watch the seconds. It also does not stay on all the time and you have to press a button to display the time but I think that is probably a great battery saver.\n\nI'm a female and this is a men's watch but it gave the illusion that it was adjustable. It is not and that's why I have given this product 4 stars instead of 5. It's one size fits all. It is about 2 notches too big for my wrist and I have a very small wrist. My friend has one as well and it fits his wrist perfectly but he also has a small wrist. So I'm warning all you large-wristed people out there, IT MIGHT BE TOO LITTLE FOR YOUR WRIST!

Both items lit brightly and beautifully.  I spritzed them with water no shorting out.  I pulled the hinge a little no bending so they seem pretty solid.

It arrived quickly. Due to the thickness of the metal band it takes a deliberate lifting to your face to see the time. A few people have commented how cool it was when they saw the LED's light up. They thought it was just a bracelet. I do have smaller wrists and had to have some links removed. I have done this before on watches but this one was much harder.

While I recognize that a review of a free product is fundamentally different from that of a product for which one has paid, I do take reviewing seriously, and so I am hopeful that my findings will prove helpful to you in your decision making. If you have questions about the watch, post them in the comments section and I'll do my best to answer based on my own experience with the product.\n\nWhat you're getting with this order:\n(1) Bracelet style watch\n(1) set written instructions\n\nWhat is this watch, and what makes it different from a regular watch?:\nThis is a bracelet style watch, done in black stainless steel.  The main difference in this watch from others is that there is no visible face when the lights are not activated. In other words, the entire watch looks like a watch band.  However, when a button is pushed to display the time, the letters glow out from the watchband and are easy to see. The watch can be toggled between time (hour and minute), date, and finally seconds. The display is large, taking up most of the dorsal side of your wrist.\n\nDoes it work?:\nYes, it works quite well. I've tested the watch and have the following observations to share:\n\nAppearance: The color is somewhere between black and gunmetal grey.  The entire watch, when the display is not activated appears to be bracelet made from a watch band.  It has two prominent buttons on the right side of the watch \"face\" itself.  These buttons are explained in the instructions that accompany the watch.  They are also listed here in the product description.\n\nBuild:  The watch is built from stainless steel and feel quite durable (I've owned it for a month now and have experienced no problems). The weakest point on the watch feels like its clasp as it is light weight and small, but I have yet to have any difficulty with it. Overall, build is solid for a sub $10 watch. The band will be small on larger wearers. I have a medium frame and I use up every last centimeter of this band.\n\nFunction: The watch is not easy to set initially.  You have to spend some time with the instructions, and even then it takes a little practice to move through each step.  But once you understand the process, it goes quite smoothly.  Once the watch is set, you just push the top button to see the time and then again to toggle through the other displays. The display itself is quite large and plenty bright, even in broad daylight.\n\nAnything else of note?:As of the posting of this review, the watch is eligible for free shipping to members of Amazon Prime; that's always a check in the plus column for me.\n\nAny negatives?:\n-The band itself is not very long, and at 8.35\", it may be too short for larger people.\n-Clasp mechanism is difficult to manipulate one handed so donning the watch independently is not simple.\n-The clasp is very difficult to undo one handed, especially if you wear the watch infrequently and don't remember exactly how it works.\n-The faceless design is very unique and not likely to please everybody.  It may be too odd for some.\n\nBottom line: This is a very interesting design concept that is being offered at the lower end of the budget price range. It displays time and date in a unique manner that is likely to please many younger shoppers who appreciate something modern and new. The build has proven to be sturdy so far and the watch has a moderate ease of use with most difficulty centering around donning/doffing via the tiny clasp.  Being unique and unusual, it is not likely to please users who prefer a more conservative watch style.  Enjoy!", "summary": "Unique, \"faceless\" design", "unixReviewTime": 1442707200}

They stand behind their product 100%.\nI had barely opened the Amazon box and Erin was already emailing me to make sure I had received the product and was pleased.

Another style I purchased very recently were lighter frames which I actually liked but two of the pairs snapped close to the hinge and broke. These are very sturdy and yet are not tight. The spring keep them on but not so tight they would hurt. Very comfortable! Nice looking. The red pair looks a bit pink in the picture but is a nice deep red. All are shiny and attractive.

I have a somewhat large and tall boy.  He was 9 months when he wore this to my sister's wedding.  We first ordered the 12-18 month size and that was too small.  It fit at around 6.5 months but I knew he'd need a larger size before the wedding. Just before the wedding I ordered the 18-24 month size and it fit on the wedding day with the following exception. The 18 month old size fit but it isn't a very stretchy material so it has an upper limit of size.  That said, the real problem was the snaps for diaper changes.  They easily unsnaped themselves with slight pressure because he was at the edge of the size and they are plastic snaps.  I like the idea of plastic rather than metal snaps but it means if your child is on the upper end of the size, they don't hold very well.  Still he looked wonderful and I'd purchase again.\n\nI don't think the sizing is really off.  Likely my son just grows fast and the material not being stretchy means it's less forgiving than your standard onesie.  Shipping was faster than they said on the 18-24 size and arrived 2 weeks earlier than the 4 week expected time (from China I suspect) which was good because the expected shipping time would have put the outfit arriving the day after my sister's wedding!", "summary": "Great product with one small flaw", "unixReviewTime": 1444694400}

The stretch is great and that's important for me because I'm a thick female and I had having a hard time when it comes to pulling them up and down. The jeggings tell the the truth so if you have curves they will be visible and if you don't have a shape that will help you look a little bit more thick. I love them and I plan on ordering all the colors. I hope that the seller gets more colors such as cobalt and green. The price is reasonable and the jeggings are comfortable.

Since it is to be worn at a dark club party, that is a bummer. The sleeves are actually bell shaped sleeves which you can't tell from the photo.

But the size Large fit perfect. I am a 36DD-38DD chest, 28 waist, 39 hip for reference. The fabric is that nice but cheap shiny faux vinyl, but a little on the thicker side, more subtle shine than the costumey glittery version. The other review says they only got 2 garters, mine has 4 as it is supposed to. It looks amazing on, very flattering. I want to wear the romper part as a bathing suit. Seriously.

We have been together for many years and I decided that we needed to spice up a sex life (same-old same-old) so I started to introduce my wife/lover to new sex toys and she LOVE them; the new sexual experience we are taking together, the experimentation, and the added attention really turned her on.  She has always had big beautiful breast with average size nipple, and she loved to having her nipples played with before and during sexual activities. Well we found that it was difficult to be playing with toys and paying the proper attention to the girls, so i decided to introduce my wife to the nipple ring and BOY did she love it. In fact I am finding that she is wearing them during the day when there is no sex involved. She tells me it is a reminder of how much fun we are having together these days and the rings keeps her motor purring, and she loves how they look on her. I have got to tell you how much of a turn on it is for me, knowing what is going on under all those cloths. Because my wife has what i would call average size nipples I had to adjust the rings a bit to keep them on. I used a pair of needle noise pliers and ever so gently working my way around the inter portion of the ring bending in downward. At the end you will have a ring with a bit smaller ID and OD, and a little more dished. Another trick is to put on and wear the rings with the opening facing down. At times we have been ever active during sex with the girls bouncing all over and these rings stay on. You have got to spend the couple of bucks and try these ring, it may introduce you to a whole new side of sex side. I would recommend these ring to those who want to give nipple rings a try.

This one was shipped from China and came about 2 weeks later. It fits perfectly in the bust and shoulder. but is not as form fitting in waist and hips.  I'm usually a small or medium, so I would say it's true to size, and it all depends on how you want it to fit. If you are large chested I would go up a size then alter the rest to fit as you like.

I have back trouble and for times when I needed to walk long distances (like an outdoor art show) and was unable to carry my regular purse, an added plus would be to find something that had just a little extra room for credit cards and money.  Another requirement for me, or at least a strong preference, was for genuine full grain leather.  I wanted something that would be attractive, easy to carry, durable and functional.  Of course, I also figured that  if I ever found this elusive product, it would cost me a small fortune.  So I looked in stores, I searched through leather booths at art shows, kept my eyes open for something that would work every time we traveled to other places, always on the lookout for my special phone bag.  Then one day I decided to look on Amazon and that is how I found this one.\n\nI couldn't believe the price for something that was suppose to be top grain leather.  But I read the description, read the reviews, viewed the pictures and decided to try it.  It seemed too perfect and I was prepared for disappointment.\n\nImagine my surprise and delight when my red beauty arrived and I realized it was everything it was advertised to be!  At least for me, this was the perfect solution to my dilemma.  I was immediately struck by the high quality exhibited in the craftsmanship of this bag.  The stitching was straight and even.  Even the hardware is heavy and beautifully finished and the bag is fully lined in a satiny material.  It is the perfect size for my phone in a wallet style case, plus it gives ample space for many cards, an inside zipper pocket and an open pocket for folding money, so that you don't even need a wallet!  There is also an outside zipper pocket that you can either wear out or next to your body for added security of the contents.  The color was much richer than the picture indicated and the leather is oh so soft and supple!  The shoulder strap is long and adjustable, and rather than the plastic edging on the strap that others use that cracks and quickly becomes unsightly, this is lined with a heavy woven tape that matches the color of the leather perfectly.  An added bonus is the removable wrist strap for those times when you do not want or need the shoulder strap.  In my last picture, you can see from the zipper tab what the thickness of the leather is and the suppleness is apparent.\n\nI am so glad that I took a chance on this bag.  It is everything they claimed it to be and I doubt that I could have designed anything more perfect for my specific need.  I would not hesitate to recommend this to anyone.  It is durable, functional and beautiful!  I also see more colors in my future  :-)", "summary": "Incredible quality for the price - Perfect for large phones!", "unixReviewTime": 1459468800}

What I love the most is the ability to use the side zipper easily for bills (like a man's wallet) & coins together. I know, I'm repeating myself, but it's so awesome, really! Most purses the bills have to be folded to fit where your coins go or put in a seperate compartment which is just dumb. I am so happy to have found this purse!

It is relatively light, so it would still serve my purposes, but is not what I wanted or expected - the photo with the phone inside of the purse shows the phone in the inner small side-pourch, but I thought it was in the main compartment, so I was under the impression the purse was smaller than it actually is.\n\nBecause the purse is a purse rather than a wallet, the shoulder strap would be more useful than the wriststrap (at least for me). The shoulder strap that it comes with is not impressive - while the metal details are nice and sturdy, the strap is made of ugly fabric on one side with a smaller strip of leather sewn to it. It actually makes me think of the strap that I used to carry my saxophone with in junior high.\n\nThe purse itself and the wriststrap are both soft leather, and the zipper is a nice accent (I ordered black, which comes with gold zippers). I just received this purse in the mail, so cannot yet speak to the durability of it, though I can see spots where the leather is already cracking along the seam.\n\nBecause of the leather's quality, the size, and the unappealing shoulder strap, this bag is going back.

I'm already using it at my job as a waitress which is very helpful with carrying change and bills. However I do use it in other ways as well. I'm a couponer. So to make my grocery trips easier and quicker sometimes I just want to pull out the coupons I need and take them with me to the grocery store instead of my big binder. I can do this with the Riverside wallet. I can easily organize my coupons in the different categories I would like and place them in the different compartments without wrinkling them since the sections are so wide and deep. Not only can i use the holster to hold the wallet but there's enough room to place grocery store ads and shopping list as well.\nThe whole assemble is very well made with great quality leather, the stitching,  the gold button closures, the chain link which secures the holster to the wallet, the gold snap closure which secures the wallet closed and the many compartments within the wallet.\nThe holster is about 5 inches wide and about 9 1/3 of an inch in length. It has a pouch, which is about 46 inches in measurement, in the front to place whatever you may like and a smaller pouch on the side which is about 25 inches in measurement to hold something small like a pen. The inside of the holster is lined with a nylon cloth which makes it easier to slide the wallet in and out.\nThe wallet is 73 1/2 inches in measurements when closed.  The wallet is lined with the same cloth as the holster and the compartments measures about 3 inches deep.  There is total of nine compartments inside and outside of the wallet including the zippered pouch on the inside. The snap closure which you press down to open the wallet has three adjustable notches to secure it when closed. The chain link is optional to be used since it has hooks on each to side. On both the holster and the wallet LEABAGS is embroidered on the front of each one.  I am really enjoying this whole ensemble because it has so much versatility and it will never go out of style. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review and all opinions are mine.", "summary": "Very versatile and i use it for my coupons", "unixReviewTime": 1432598400}

The bodice also leaves option for cami to show through, or to adjust amount of skin you're comfortable with showing. I ordered my normal size & it fit SO perfect!  Love the long flowing sleeves and the embroidery it's done tastefully, and  I ordered during Utah winter thinking of wearing with jeans or leggings, possibly as a cape or layering item, but it's definitely more of a dress, sewn together all around, I've been wearing it during winter as a dress with tall boots (as shown), as long as I know I won't be out in the cold long, and I'll still layer it for the winter because it's so versatile and I really do love it!

It was well packaged . I love the dress.  I ordered a Large. I did contact the seller after I placed my order (which I should have done before I ordered) I gave my measurements and they did confirm that Large was the size to go with.  I'm 5ft 3 inches  waist 29 inches\n chest 36DD and  I weigh 129lbs. The dress itself skims/drapes my body nicely. The chest area fits nicely not too loose nor too tight. It shows just the right amount of cleavage too look classy yet kinda sexy. (If that's the look u want) . If your measurements are similar to mine and you'd like a more \"flowy/boho look or would want to wear a tank or camisole underneath then I'd size up. For ladies who would want a more fitted look up top and similar chest measurements you could probably size down BUT I don't believe a padded /push-up bra would work the bra itself would need to be unpadded.  The material is nice and soft gauzy feeling. The embroidery was well done. The colors were different than what was shown in photos. They were more of a purple pinky pastels which I like better....(I ordered the Black dress). I noticed  areas like around the neckline and hem that some of the threading is slightly loose...which can easiy be fixed. I personally am not concered with it but maybe after a few washings i may have to tighten up threads with a few stitche. There is a nice light liner sewn into the dress so it is not see-thru. Maybe with the lighter colored dress's  but you can always wear nude colored Shapers of some sort underneath if there is a concern. So when trying to figure out a size to order you must look at the measurements that are shown by the seller NOT Amazons sizing chart. In other reviews I read there  is a small percentage of customers that said the measurements shown were way off by several cm  ....I did not find this to be an issue for me. 99% of the dress fit perfectly in the way I like my clothing to fit. The 1% is that the sleeves could of been a little longer but overall the dress is a fantastic buy and at a great price . I will be ordering the white one and the pinkish one as well. One more thing ...I tried a corset over top of the dress just for fun and it seems like the dress was made to to have a corset worn with it. I think it's a great idea especially with with Octoberfest  coming up...it would make for a great outfit.", "summary": "Fantastic Buy And Great Price", "unixReviewTime": 1472774400}

I figured at worst I could modify it into an open front jacket.\n\nWell, I got it and I fell in love with it. I discovered this very quickly; I ordered a Large and I went sans bra...and it fit. Sure...it looked a bit busty, but the dress provides natural support. It was comfortable and light. I got a TON of compliments and I watched as two separate people pulled our their phones and order the dress.\n\nMinor Cons:\n\nThe clasps at the front are not the most sturdy. In fact, one came off when I went to hook it (More than enough room to clasp it over my chest, the thread holding it looked like it had come loose at some point and it pulled free as I manipulated it) and the second one wasn't even secured on all the way. I have heavier hooks and it took all of 5 minutes to put new ones on and it's perfect, so check the threads before you go out or you could have a wardrobe malfunction.\n\nIt's definitely shorter than it looks in the pictures, but not horribly so. The model image makes it look longer and fuller than it is...but it's still wonderful. I wish it was about 6\" longer and just a bit more fabric to make a fuller skirt, but that's just personal preference.\n\nAll in all, it's beautiful. I'll be ordering another white one and two of the blues.\n\nBeautiful!", "summary": "Amazing!", "unixReviewTime": 1470441600}

The dress runs very small, tight chested, way shorter than shown in \"image\" poor quality stitching, dry and thin material that feels awful to touch. I have learned a valuable lesson.. Images of clothing on Amazon are of pretty and good quality clothing, however you will likely get cheap quality knock off only worth 1/8 of the actual price you pay for it clothing. Amazon needs to monitor their sellers to insure quality items are actually being sent to customers as shown and advertised in their images.. No more Amazon clothing purchases for this family.

I noticed the bust went up about 2\" for each size increase so based on this, I ordered size xxl guessing that would make the bust 41.5_42\" which should have fit. Boy was I wrong. The dress was big everywhere except the bust. It only measured 36.75\" at the bust on the actual dress. It was even tight on My sister who is a size 2 and A cup size. I don't know who designs these totally out of proportion clothes but they are way off on a woman's shape. I am so disappointed because the dress is so me and really cute and one I know I would wear often if only the bust was the proper size. I want this dress so bad so I returned the 2xl and purchased a 3xl which is 3-4 sizes bigger than I normally wear. The bust is still tight but at least I can breath. The bust according to the size chart should be 43.5\". The dress I received measured 40\" so a few inches smaller than the size chart.

I could not take an appropriate photo of me wearing it because of the size. The top fit but it was really right and kindve uncomfortable. It's stretchy but not stretchy enough for me. It also comes with removable padding!\n\nThe bottoms are cute also. I just love the pattern on this bathing suit and the colors, it goes great with my personality. The bottoms for perfectly, I usually fit into a medium bottom, but these were a large. Because they run smaller they fit like a medium. There are ties on both sides of the bathing suit which I love because it gives it an extra amount of cuteness rather than just the regular bottoms without any strings hanging.\n\nI would recommend this bathing suit for sure, just always consider the sizing chart and possibly go up a size from your normal one.

This beautiful wallet has two gold zipper closures; one compartment has 8 accordion folds that can hold up to 12 cards, and a pocket for cash or change. I opened my package and that wonderful leather scent wafted out. I really don't know how to test the RFID part but as a wallet this palm-sized pocketbook gets 5 stars. There is a light texture on the outside and the brand is stamped in one corner. The first zippered compartment that holds the card slots is beg enough for my credit cards, and coupons or rewards cards both to keep them together. When completely full, the wallet can double in width. The only thing I am used to having that this lacks is a clear slot for a driver's license or Identification Card. The other zippered  compartment has two sleeves for IDs or I used it for gift cards, and an opened pocket for cash or coins (or thin pad if that is what is needed!) I love that it takes up HALF the space in my already small purse than my previous wallet. Added security bonus- prevents scammers from scanning your wallet for personal information. AWESOME.

That got it 3 stars.  It would have been good enough for 5 stars if it weren't for the incredible frustration [like most everyone else had] of separating the backing from the foam.  ARGH!  Yes, ultimately the right knife worked.  The knife I used was a Swiss army knife with a very sharp, very clean, very thin 2\" blade.  It was still no cakewalk.  I wasted the better part of a foot of the tape with false starts.  Most times when I gently, carefully, steadily attempted to insert the blade between the foam and white backing a fine layer of foam remained on the tape. That fine layer made it impossible to pull the two layers apart.\nI have a suggestion if you decide to buy this product: Don't cut all the sections of the foam and tape that you'll need at the start.  Every piece will require another session with the knife.  Start with the beginning of the whole roll.  Try to get the corners or edge of the beginning separated with your knife.  If you end up trashing the the end without separating the layers, cut the end off so you have a new edge to work with.  Eventually if the hat gods are kind you'll free a tiny bit of the backing from the foam.  Now using your fingernail increase the separation until you can grasp the foam in one hand and the backing in the other.  Peel the layers apart til you have the right length.  Cut ONLY the foam piece off leaving the tape still attached to the roll.  Once you've placed that first piece in your hat it should be pretty easy to start peeling apart the next section you need.  When your hat is the right size leave a tape tail on the end of the roll so you have something to grab the next time.", "summary": "The product is a good one - does it's job and is easy to ...", "unixReviewTime": 1527292800}

I am so happy with the clothing from these companies! Not only are their garments wonderful, but my communication with them has been very prompt and courteous.\n\nI was really excited about this dress arriving. With the summer heat, I was looking for something that would be loose and flowing, nice on my skin, and look really pretty.  This dress is gorgeous!  The color is exactly what I saw online, if you look at the pictures of the dress on the model.  The close up shots of the fabric make it look darker than it really is.  I ordered the grey, although I would describe it as \"grey with a very subtle hint of purple\".  I really like that the overlay of the dress is a darker grey, and the under piece is a lighter grey.  The bottom hem is asymmetrical, which adds to the feminine flow of the dress.\n\nThe fabric is comfortable - it feels like a cotton.  It has a linen look to it, although I don't think it is actually linen - but I think another reviewer brought that up.  That being said, the fabric is still easy and cool to wear in the summer.  It looks very cute with sandals, flats, or Mary Janes.\n\nI am 5'3\" and 130 pounds.  I typically wear a US size 4, and am normally a small.  I was nervous about sizing (since it is an Asian company) and I ended up ordering a medium.  I was worried that it would end up being too form fit, when I really wanted something really loose.  I was also worried about shrink factor during laundering. I probably could have gotten away with the small, but I think the medium is pretty perfectly sized for me.  Because it is meant to be loose, I used the bust size as my primary consideration.  I feel as if it is true to size, if you use their size chart, not Amazon's. Their size chart is located in the product description section.\n\nI think I'll be able to wear this into the fall with a short-sleeved top layered underneath it.  I could probably even get away with this into the winter with  close-fitting long sleeved top and some boots!\n\n I absolutely love this dress, and will be purchasing more clothing from this line!
