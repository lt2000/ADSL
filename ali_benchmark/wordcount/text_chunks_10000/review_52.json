So maybe to you this fits true to size, but that's my story. I buy 30F bras and in this I need 30E. It's gorgeous, fully lined, with foam to shape the cups. Nice rounded shape and very flattering. The strap lays nicely, is removable, and provides no support. My only wish is that I could have gotten a little more secure fit in the band. It is snug, but I still feel a little low and saggy without straps that support. I think this is just the way a swim top like this is though.

I can live with that, but it's good to be aware of beforehand. Thus far I have been impressed with how well the bottom of the tankini stays put while swimming, even on a couple of long tubing trips. This impresses me, as most tankinis I've had have tended to float or ride up while I swam. I LOVE the fact that the built-in bra is well-padded (with padding that stays put), and adjustable, just like a real bra.\n\nI haven't had it long enough to be completely confident of durability, but my Panache bras have been durable, and it feels high-quality. I will try to come back and update after I've had it longer.\n\nUPDATE: After swimming in this all summer and into autumn (I live in Texas), I can confirm that I love it as much as before.\n\nDespite the deep plunge, which sometimes feels like it's catching the water (especially when swimming straight into a current), I haven't had any... ahem... exposure problems.

In this case I found the XXL to be wider than normal, but a normal length.  I could have gone with just an XL and I am normally very hesitant to do that.  The shirt itself is beautiful and has intricate embroidered flowers along the top front and sides and in the middle front of the shirt.  These are well done and you can tell the difference between these and others that are quickly sewn and not as detailed.  The detail around the neck and arms is another beautiful touch.\n\nI found the shirt to be fairly light weight and it felt very nice to wear on a hot day.  It breaths nicely, although you might need to wear a tank under it depending on how sheer you are comfortable with.  The colors of the flowers are bright and there are a variety of beautiful colors through the embroidery of the s***.  The sleeves flare out a bit at the ends and the feeling and movement of the shirt is nice.  It is cotton, so it does wrinkle, but I didn't find it to be horrible wrinkled as the day went on.\n\nI washed this and dried it on low heat. I didn't see any colors bleeding and the shirt did well in the gentle cycle.  I was very impressed with how well made the shirt is and how comfortable, also. It is one of my favorites and I'm so glad I found it.  It is not nearly as expensive as the detail suggests or as many of the shirts that embroidered in Mexico and by hand.  I would say order the size you would normally wear because it is over-size, especially on top.

He says he loves it, school doesn't start back up till next month so I'll have to wait to see if pinkie pie/rarity gets as much rare as rainbow dash.\n\nI know a lot of people have issues with these coats running small, we have not had that issue.  My son is 10, he has the rainbow dash coat in both size 12 and size 14 and he has the pinkie pie and rarity ones in size 16(so he has room to grow and room to layer underneath it in the winter).  He currently wears size 12 slim pants and size 14 shirts, a year ago when I bought him his first rainbow dash coat he was wearing 10 slim pants and size 12 shirts, all 4 hoodies have fit him true to size, exactly like his hoodies from other stores, in the same size, fit.  He is very skinny, and obviously is a boy so he doesn't have the same proportions as a typical 14 year old girl, so that might be part of why we haven't had issues when others have, but they also fit my 12 year old daughter true to size as well.", "summary": "exactly like his hoodies from other stores", "unixReviewTime": 1405468800}

Sometimes I want to try on shades before I buy them simply because I hate to wear sunglasses that pinch my temples and give me a headache. These were such a great bargain I figured if I'd try them.\nThe pink color exactly matches my pink and black swimsuit. I can't wait to get in the pool.\nThe style is great. Very festive!\n\nCons: Actually, they're too big! When someone with a head the size of mine says her sunglasses are too big, they're biiiig. They feel fine, but the top corners of the frame extends past the side of my face on both sides. Big, I'm telling you. If you've a wee little noggin, you're gonna look redic. I'm not sure I'd wear them out to a picnic or such because I think they're just too big. However, they're perfect to wear while lounging on a pool float.\n\nIn conclusion- great bargain, really fashionable, but the frame is big big.", "summary": "So cute!

They're tight fitting, not gonna slide down your butt when you're getting out of the water but very comfortable. They don't squeeze or cut into me anywhere. I possibly could have gotten a medium on the top but then the bottoms probably would have been a little too small. They should definitely give us the option of buying the top and bottom separately.

I am 5'6'', 125, with a slender athletic build and a 34B bra size (usually).  I thought that the small may be a good fit because I am not very large chested and do not have much of a backside or a lot of fat on my hips (I'm pretty bony), though I ordered the medium as well just in case.  It turns out that the medium was the better choice.\n\nThe bottoms are still a little snug, though secure feeling, and the back of the bottoms definitely shows a little cheek (although I wouldn't say too much as I was going for a sexy look when buying this).  If the bottoms stretch out at all as bathing suits tend to do, I think they will be a great fit.  The smalls definitely were too tight around my hips.\n\nThe top of the medium is also secure.  The portion that wraps around the back has a slightly adjustable clasp, although for me it was comfortable on the loosest setting.  The halter part ties around the back of the neck and is very adjustable.  The medium top gives me the cleavage I was looking for without being too uncomfortably tight.  The small top was on the verge of being too tight around my back, and seemed to squish my chest in too much as to not create cleavage.\n\nAs a side note, the three straps on the hips do not separate as much as the picture shows; on me it looked more like one solid hip band, but this wasn't the main reason I bought the suit anyway.  I'll be returning the small.\n\nOverall the suit feels very secure and durable.  I bought the white which is flattering on me because I have a tanned skin tone.

I ordered the last one of these dresses that was available for sale on Amazon. There was no size listed, but it was on sale for $20, so I decided to take a chance. Thanks to Amazon prime, it was delivered to my mailbox at about 9 on a Sunday morning. When I opened the package, I was thrilled to see that the dress was a size medium. I'm sure I could have easily won a large or extra large because of the stretchy fabric, but the medium fits well.\nIt's a beautiful bright red and a very pretty design. It's actually quite a bit more modest than I expected. The high neckline makes the dress tasteful, and the sheer lace sides and back aren't cut too low.\nThe slit in the front hits me mid-thigh, which is a bit high for my taste, but it doesn't look trashy. The slit isn't on a seam, so the top of it makes a \"u\" shape on your leg. I may decide to stitch the slit closed a little bit, but I'll pin it first to make sure that it will lay right.\nThe material is thin, but it's not see-through, and even though I have lots of lumps and bumps, you can't see them or a pantyline with only the smoothing powers of control top pantyhose. I can also wear my regular nude bra with this dress. No strapless is necessary!\nA few negatives besides the slit: the stitching on the sweetheart front is a bit crooked, but my necklace will cover that, and the dress is a tiny bit too short to be worn with much of a heel. A larger size might have been longer, but the medium fits well on my bust and waist.\nConsidering that I took a chance on a $20 dress with no listed size, I'm pretty happy! It fits, needs no special undergarments to look good on my 44 year old body, and it doesn't need to need to be altered. I'm excited for my husband to see me in this. ;)", "summary": "Right size and fit outweigh the few minor negatives", "unixReviewTime": 1512864000}

I ordered some of these orange kind and the Sky blue color, an the sky blue are about an 8th of an inch wider than the orange.  So when i go to checkerboard these they might not look as good as planned since they aren't quite the same size as I was expecting.  Of course, this may be due to the fact that the sky blue were 60Inches long, and the Orange are 45inches. I think you may get the same size is you order the same lengths, but i needed the sky blue to be a bit longer for my straight lace. I was expecting them to be closer to a neon orange, but they are a little darker than that, but they still look great.\n\nPros:\nQuick shipping.\nSweet orange is nice and vibrant.\nSky blue is almost teal like I was looking for.\nThe company shipping will promptly answer any questions you may have.\n\nCons:\nDifferent lengths of laces may have different widths. Not ideal for checkerboard lacing.\nNo idea if the colors you ordered are the ones you were looking for until you get them.\nMay be slightly wrinkled when you get them because they are kind of just tied loosely together in shipping.\nOne of the sweet orange laces is about a half an inch longer than the other one.\nOne of the sky blue laces is about an inch longer than the other.", "summary": "Sweet orange, not neon orange", "unixReviewTime": 1403136000}

The bottom fits snugly on my stomach but the lace is baggy. It's to much of a hassle to send it back and try for a smaller size that may not fit my belly so I'm just going to sew about an inch of the lace folded into the shoulders. When I hold it like that the back does look cool enough to almost make it worth the price. Just know what your getting and don't expect to much. I would suggest this shirt to someone petite with a B cup and tell them to order the small. It's very hit or miss on shirts like this but I do think someone with the right body type would look amazing in it and if you think that could be you, go for it. And trust me your going to want a flat stomach for this one. The lace is really super cool though so if my sewing attempt works I'm just going to suck it in. Beauty is painful, *sigh*...

These fit the bill perfectly!\n\nThe lenses on these sunglasses are rated to block BOTH UVA AND UVB rays.  Many people don't realize you need to be wearing glasses rated to block both of these, but that is imperative to the protection of your eyes!  Extended exposure to UV rays has been linked to several forms of eye damage including macular degeneration and cataracts.  So be sure to cover up those eyes, also don't forget you are getting UV rays from the sun even when it isn't shining bright! ;)\n\nI also love that these sunglasses come with an awesome zip up hard carry case!!! I can hook the case on my shorts, my tackle box, my seat, whatever and pop them in there if I'm putting on my goggles to go swimming!  No scratching or losing these this year!!! (I HOPE haha).

They don't wiggle or move while on and stay where they need to. I was afforded the opportunity to review these at no cost to provide everyone with my honest opinion. I like the leopard theme and the coloring. The frames have UV400 protective coating and blocks the harmful rays from the sun to your eyes. Safety is always best! The sides of the sunglasses are thin, but not weirdly looking thin. It also came with a nice case to protect them when you are not wearing them. The case is strong and is black with white/grey dot pattern. The zipper on it worked as it should and at the end of the zipper it has a clip so that you can clip it on backpack or wherever you want for easy access. It was stitched securely to the case as well.

This style of glasses is supposed to be a bit big so that has been taken into consideration.\nI am absolutely in love with these sunglasses. The look is stylish and attractive. I wasn't expecting such a good quality but I have been amazed. The plastic frame is strong and withstands external pressure. It's not one of those frames that you can imagine breaking just by touching them. The sidearms have also have the tortoise shell pattern on them and have some elasticity in them. I tried to open them up a bit farther than usual and I had no issues, neither did they come apart. But I would recommend not doing so a lot. The lenses are not polarized but they have a brown tint so they do the job. At this price, these are a steal. It also provides protection against harmful UVA (400) rays. Of course, I haven't tested that claim. I don't know how to. The glasses came in a strong black case including a microfiber cleaning cloth.

The price of the wallet may be expensive to some, but if you are looking for a stylish, luxurious , durable, high-grade leather wallet, then look no further this is the seller to go to for your next wallet.

Not too much but it is enough to fit my bag without making that weird shape! It also has different bag material it seems, a lot more strong looking and much better reinforced.\nThe cat paw hanging on the front pocket is also different from the last time I bought it, other time was made of this faux leather now it's made of a soft plastic! Now I don't have to worry about damaging or it falling off!\n\nI'm really happy how much different the two bags were even if I bought it from the same place, both made me really happy and if i were to buy another bag I think I'd come to this store again!!\nLots of my friends loved my bag too and I've gotten a lot of compliments on how it has cat ears haha\n\nAlso the side pockets are a lot bigger than last time as well, before it was strictly for phones but now I'm able to fit cans and bottles?!

Yes these are a pretty good price and all but it's one of those you get what you pay for things. I recently bought one as my first binder and have been wearing for around 3 months. I have stopped wearing this because and would not recommend it to anyone due to the poor fitting, quality, and design. Now I didn't have a problem with it fitting around, its's that the binding part is not long enough to cover my entire chest (As I have a rather large chest) it was obviously made for people with small chests even though I did get one that was two sizes over my actual size. That causes a lot of discomfort and as I have learned could cause actual problems. The material quality is also poor and not very stretchy at all which is one thing binders should always be. Not being stretchy can cause problems with breathing, and other injuries. As for the design please do you're research on binders before buying one. They are not supposed to have binding material all the way around, only in the front. (unless it made to correct back posture which this is definitely not) This is because it binds everything, not just your chest. That will cause a lot of problems with your back, ribs, and shoulders which could lead to injury and tissue damage. I did not realize all of this when buying this product and regret it a lot. So unless you have a small chest and don't plan to wear it often or for long periods of time I highly recommend looking for something of better quality that is safer to wear.", "summary": "Please be careful when ordering a binder.", "unixReviewTime": 1438473600}

If I had a 34-36 inch waist that would be fine but it does not look appropriate for my 29-30 inch waist.  Overall the fit is close enough to not be a deal breaker as I will still use it to play golf, but I was hoping the shirt would fit closer to a V framed torso.

Here is the review for that...\nAnother great Finn + Emma item... I try to cover my baby in as much 100% organic cotton clothes as much as possible. I have a lot of burt's bees and finn + emma. F+E has better material in my opinion and feels sturdier after several washes. (BB thins and wears out a little faster).\n\nThis convertible gown is great for babies and I use it for my son as pajamas. He wore the 3-6 months one for months 4 to 5. My baby has always been on the bigger side and this got a little tight for him in the crotch area around month 5 (he was 29in at his month 5 checkup).\n\nPros:\nThe gown is convertible so you can either have it footed or open (easier for diaper changes)\nNot many front buttons (my baby loved flipping from tummy to back and vice versa so he didn't like clothes with front buttons on it).\nSturdy fabric 100% Organic Cotton\nNice design and color\nFast shipping and great packaging!\n\nCons:\nThe head part was always a struggle to put on my son. It was a tight squeeze to get his head through (he was also 95th percentile for his age so it might be his fault ^_^)\nButtons were a little hard to button\n\nOverall, another great product from F+E. Looking forward to new designs and hope they come out with larger sizes.. I purchased this product at a discounted price in return for my testing & evaluation and honest, unbiased review. Like you, I rely on these reviews to select & ultimately purchase a product, so I give my opinion based on personal use. Hope my review helps!

This outfit was made with baby in mind because it's very soft and comfortable. The material is made from organic items which help ensure it won't irritate your baby's skin. The style of this outfit makes it easier to put on a squirmy baby. There are buttons near the collar of the top to widen the neck and snaps along the bottom which convert easily, you just criss cross and snap together the lining of a leg instead of turning it into a gown. This outfit was ordered according to sizing by age and it fits very accurately. I have not tried washing the outfit yet, but I am sure that it should be washed on a gentler cycle. I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Sweet Little Organic Gown", "unixReviewTime": 1464566400}

Flannel is nice and soft and will probably become more so over time.  Sleeves are open with no cuffs or elastic just a 1/2 inch hem on them.  As others have said, the neckline may be problematic.  It continues to slide down a bit because the shoulder seam doesn't sit up on the shoulder but slightly below it in the front.  This being the case it causes the already wide neckline to fall in a potentially most inconvenient place.  I have some lace I might consider adding around the front of the neckline to help close this up a bit.  I believe that will solve the problem.

There are so many colors to choose from and they come exactly as expected. So much cheaper than most name brand products and honestly they last much longer. I purchased these back in the summer of 2015 and I still wear them every day. They get washed constantly and I've yet to have one tear up on me. With brand names I'm always very skeptical of how they will fit some companies make their clothing smaller than others so what you expect is a large disappointment these I have no worries when it comes time to order more. They really are the perfect fit and are true to their size. No need to order larger or smaller just you're regular size. I'd much rather spend this any day for a good quality product that will last a year plus than order a top I'm unsure about from an overly expensive name brand company and it not fit well at all.

However the first one I purchased I bought in a western store where I was able to try them on first. The next two were purchased on Amazon. I ordered the same size as the first one because I figured it would fit as the first one did. The first one showed up and sat on my head like a thimble. It was over 1/4\" smaller compared to the first one when using a fabric measuring tape. I  had a hat stretcher but didn't think I could get one to stretch this far. I contacted the seller and  the manufacturer and neither one ever replied concerning my issue. Three emails were sent to each of them and no response. So I figured I might as well try and stretch it as far as I could. I applied heavy amount of steam and did it a little at a time. I can now at least wear the hat but anything longer than a few hours and I have a headache, so it is seldom worn. Why I bothered buying another one of their products is beyond me, but I did just that. The third hat was this black straw hat. I took it out of the box and placed on my head and the lights went out. I kid you not, it was so large it covered my eyes. These are not expensive hats by any means. I have hats that cost me 10 times what these do, but I don't want to wear them when working on the ranch. Resistol use to make good quality items and they had good customer service, not any longer. Once again three or four emails to the seller and Resistol and never received a reply from either one.  I have used the foam insulation trick but it is just to big for even this to be comfortable. I will never purchase another Resistol product or anything from this seller again.

First off, I LOVE the price, of course. I am thrilled that I can get pretty decent clothes for a good price.\n\nThis dress took about a month to arrive after I ordered it. I ordered it to wear to a wedding I'm going to, and it arrived the day before I am to leave for my trip. I guess that would have been perfect timing had the dress fit properly...\n\nI am 5'5\", weigh 135 pounds, have a tiny waist and 32DDD bra. Wide hips. I ordered this dress in medium. When I received the dress, I was excited because the quality seemed just fine at first glance. The fabric is soft and cotton-y, but somewhat sheer so that in bright light, you can see through the fabric and the outline of the legs is obvious. Otherwise it is opaque enough to wear without a slip underneath as long as your undergarments are nude and match your skin.\n\nThe dress is shorter than what I expected. It hits right at the top of my ugly knees. I always get dresses that are just long enough to hide my knees because I hate them, lol! So that was sad that it was shorter. The top is also much higher than how it looks in the photo. Or maybe just on me it seems higher. At any rate, the picture makes it look cleavage baring and sexy, but in real life it's not. It hides all my cleavage. Not sexy enough to wear around Vegas. Maybe I need a super duper push up bra for that effect ;)\n\nAlso, on me, with my smaller than average waist, there is a lot of fabric bagging and sagging on my lower back above my butt. It's just a lot of loose fabric that hangs there and makes me look really dumpy. From the front view, it's cute and fits well. From the side/back, the sagging droopy fabric in that one area annoys me. I will definitely need to spend some time altering this dress to fit my body perfectly.\n\nIf you're around my stats but have a nice bubble butt to fill the loose fabric and good looking knees, this dress would probably fit you well. It is stretchy and comfortable. Very cute, over all. I'm just bummed that it wasn't perfect off the rack, haha!\n\nI will most likely order from them again and simply alter the garments to fit my measurements.", "summary": "Electric Blue Color Block Pencil Shift Dress (Black with blue section down the front)", "unixReviewTime": 1412812800}

The material is light and airy and feels good on my skin. I also like the embellishments on the waistband, it really makes the dress look more elegant and sophisticated.

I think you could fit a quilted vest under it if you wanted. I have long arms, so it seems no matter what women's coat I buy, the sleeves end up short for me. I find this jacket to be tight in the upper arms, so multiple layers get a little tight there.\n\nBest features:\n- High collar, made of a thick, sweater like material that is good for hiding behind when the wind gets nasty, and you forget your scarf. This material is also around the cuffs, so wind can't sneak up your arm. Nice details.\n- Zipper that has two pulls, so you can unzip the bottom, for a little extra stride room.\n- Good sized flap with snaps that covers the zipper. This is good for keeping the wind out, and for buttoning up quick when you're in a hurry.\n\nNot so great features:\n- POCKETS. Disappointing pocket situation, for all the thought put into other features. Just two outside pockets, and they are chop pockets. I can fit my thin glove and my keys in one pocket, but it's not ideal, and it bulges out rather awfully. Yes, they do have zippers on them, but that's kind of scratchy when reaching in and out. No inside pockets. (I will admit that this is a general beef I have with A LOT of women's clothing. Get it together women's clothing industry.) Most people have a phone, and carrying it in a shallow chop pocket, with a zipper, is a good way for it to fall out when you bend over or sit, and scratch it on the way out. I know ladies have purses, but if you're already wearing a parka, in a blizzard, how much stuff do you want to juggle? (Rant over, sorry.)\n- It is not the most flattering of silhouettes, especially with gloves in your pockets (I couldn't help myself), but this is more of a necessity coat than a fashion statement.\n\nThis is not a coat for spending long periods of time in cold weather, but for walking the dog around the block, the walk into and out of work and the grocery store, it serves its purpose.

I usually ignore the size charts so this was my lesson to learn.  Size charts are there for a reason and can be very helpful when ordering from a company for the first time so duly noted.  That said, this coat is BIG.  So big in fact that it feels like you're wearing a tent.  I returned the first coat, consulted the size chart, realized the error of my ways and ordered another that was two sizes smaller than my original purchase.  It came today and guess what...STILL A TENT.  I'm not a small woman, in fact the first coat i ordered in a 1X because i wanted a comfortable fit with some room for thicker sweaters or layers and i thought that 1X would give me that.  I'm disappointed because i had high hopes for this coat to be my go-to choice in the closet but the second one is already boxed up and on its way back and i will not be ordering a third.  My other issue is less important and it's with the color.  I purchased the navy and it's a really dull and frumpy navy blue.  Could be the size issue affecting my overall opinion of the color but i just realized i didn't like anything about this coat enough to continue to play the what size should i really get game anymore.  My advice to anyone considering this coat, it looks NOTHING like the picture with the model wearing it with her cute little sweater and jeans.  The coat has no form or shape to it. No darts in the back to flatter the figure it just hangs.  On the plus side, It does seem kind of warm and if you could solve the size mystery seems like it would be a really comfortable weekend coat.  So if roominess takes priority over style then this coat will definitely give you the room.  Just don't be like me and ignore the size chart.", "summary": "Buyers Beware You're Buying a Tent...", "unixReviewTime": 1476230400}

This wallet has less embellishment on the front, so it's slimmer. And me, a self-professed card-and-movie-ticket hoarder, absolutely loves the space of Iron Fist wallets across the board. They all have basically identical interior card arrangement and no shortage of hidden pockets and slots. The ONLY complaint I have is the ID card window. it does NOT have a thumb hole, you know how there's usually a hole in the middle of the plastic window so you can put your thumb (or other preferred finger) there to shove the card up and out of the slot? none of the wallets seem to have that. no matter though, I simply fixed it by cutting one with an Exacto knife. paired with the Iron Fist Muerta Punk black and pink purse that has been out of production for years (I managed to hunt down a NWT one on eBay that someone has obviously bought and shoved into their closet), my accessories are a knockout.

It fits small but I expected that part since other reviews mentioned it.  If you order a couple of sizes higher than you normally wear it should be fine.\n\nAmazon description says that it is 95% cotton and 5% polyester and the tag on the shirt says it is 100% cotton.  I don't think either of these is correct.  I thought it would fit more like a cotton t-shirt with a little stretch.  I would guess after feeling the fabric that it is at least 50% synthetic if not more.  It is very stretchy and more like a biking or running shirt than a t-shirt.\n\nDelivery takes a very long time as others have said.  Don't count on it arriving by any particular set date no matter what is posted on tracking.  Other than the material and delivery it is an OK shirt and I like the look of this one and others they have.

We watched a video on you tube for how to properly lace the dress, which was very helpful, especially in keeping the ties flat when cinching it up. Dress bought for homecoming dance, coming up in October, it should look great. We also bought a thin sweater to cover her shoulders, etc. although school has approved of dress.
