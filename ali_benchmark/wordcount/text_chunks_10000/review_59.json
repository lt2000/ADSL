Plus the seller has great customer service --that alone made my 4 stars into 5! You can easily chat with them online --which I did.  Very helpful! Delivery was quick --and they have an office in southern California! Packaging, I must mention --is very good.  It wasn't fancy --just the usual plastic mailing envelope but what impressed me was the fact that they  have all the information you need if you need to exchange your dress for a bigger size or a different color! They want you to be totally happy with your purchase --how refreshing! Will definitely buy from this seller again.  If you're hesitant about ordering a dress online --don't be!  Go for it!", "summary": "Great Dress, Awesome Value", "unixReviewTime": 1473984000}

Still it is pretty forgiving a fits very well. The problem is the hooks. Normally there is a center wire in the hook that springs down and holds the hook in place. These hooks are defective, the detent wire doesn't latch. It took ten minutes to figure out how to get all of them hooked without the front hooks I just connected coming undone behind me. Wearing it the hooks come undone in fifteen minutes top to bottom just from turning, bending, bouncing and breathing. I guess I will try sqeezing them tighter with pliers.

First, they are definitely leggings - they are soft and comfortable.  I ordered a Navy and a Black pair.  The black is like a black denim wash; navy is like a dark denim wash.

Or, with leggings, the legs aren't long enough and the crotch never makes it to my, well, crotch.  I have a bubble butt and thick thighs.  The fit on these was PERFECT on my butt.  In fact, my 15yr old, who is a smaller size but has the same shape, insisted that I order her some bc she said they looked AMAZING!  And we all know the tough critics that teenage girls can be.  They are so soft and comfortable.  They are not high waisted on me, but I didn't expect them to be, as I am very long waisted I have a long inseam.  They do, however, fit comfortably on my stomach, and don't fold over when I sit, which is what normally happens.  They don't gape in the back either, as most bottoms of any kind do on a bubble-butted gal.  The pockets on the bum are very small, and set wide, which are flattering for my body shape.  I am very happy with my purchase!  My only concern is that the fabric is thin, and could fall apart with laundering.

If you are looking for heirloom quality pieces, look elsewhere.  This was my first \"Statement Necklace\", and  I got SO many compliments on it, I bought it in purple as well.

They are not trying to fool anyone into believing they are \"real\", they are tongue in cheek chic...I am Seventy one years old, and I was raised to wear \"Ladylike accessories\".  These Statement necklaces would have been considered \"Trashy\" and in poor taste.  However, times and styles change and I choose to wear what makes me happy.  This trend toward Statement necklaces gets people talking, and I have gotten NO negative feedback---in fact, several people have wanted to know where I bought hem.  Because styles come and go so quickly, I returned to Amazon to \"stock up\",  and have now purchased quite a selection of these Statement pieces so I will be enjoying them for a long while.  Unlike my \"real\" jewelry, these are so  Inexpensive I can afford them in all my favorite colors.  I now have over eighteen of them and they are great fun.  I wear them with plain, jewel neck sweaters in matching colors and they sit nicely at the base of the ribbing.  Then, I actually splurged on several inexpensive sheath dresses with sweetheart or V necklines in solid jewel tones to show off my new pieces.  Although many of them come in sets. With matching earrings, I find that to be \"too much statement\",  and so I usually wear small, co ordinating stud earrings and let the necklace speak for itself.

One problem is the 925 marking. It is not engraved on the bracelet, but rather it is on a small tag that is attached to the bracelet. This cannot help but make one wonder if that small attached piece is the only part of this bracelet that is actually sterling. I do know that if it were manufactured in this country it would have to be clearly marked 925 on the bracelet itself. It is a pretty piece and I do like it, but it is also almost too heavy to be sterling silver. I suspect, frankly, that it is sterling plated base metal with one tiny little attached disk that is sterling. Since I paid such a pittance for it I could recommend the purchase as it is a lovely bracelet, as long as the purchaser understands that the chances of the entire bracelet actually being sterling are pretty much slim to none. Also, I have had to repair this bracelet no less than five times now. The links that hold the bracelet together are not soldered, consequently with just the smallest amount of pressure they part and the bracelet breaks away from the link. I have twice had to replace the links myself as they were lost when the bracelet popped apart. Unless you have someone to fasten this bracelet for you each time you put it on and take it off, do not purchase it as it will soon break on you. It is a shame that this pretty bracelet is so poorly made, it truly is a lovely, unique piece, and it would be a five star bracelet if not for the myriad problems associated with it. I don't think I can honestly recommend this product for purchase. You get what you pay for truly applies here. Although I love the look, it has been one problem after another and a huge pain in the nether regions. I would like to add that I had not realized this bracelet was coming from a company called FACTORY DIRECT SALES. This company has lied to me several times, and misrepresented their products on every occasion I have dealt with them. I once purchased an office chair from them through another company, not Amazon. They took the funds from my account immediately, then sent me an email stating that the chair had been shipped. Seven days later, after being hung up on by their so called customer support team members not once but twice, I finally reached a supervisor who calls himself \"steve\". Steve admitted to me that not only was the chair not shipped, it was on back order. Steve promised me an upgrade, and apologized profusely for the \"misunderstanding.\" The chair arrived a couple weeks later. It was NOT an upgrade, but it was a terrible piece of workmanship. It permanently lists to the left because the screw holes were misaligned. The chair was not worth a quarter of what I paid for it. I have emailed the company several times in the six months since this happened. I received one email from them in which they begged me not to trash them until they had been given a chance to \"make things right\". Six months later, that is the ONLY email I have ever received from them. If you value quality for your money, do not ever bother to purchase any thing from FACTORY DIRECT SALES. They are liars, cheaters, and have no social redeeming qualities. GUARANTEED. That is the only guarantee they will ever live up to!", "summary": "I would like to add that I did not realize that this bracelet was manufctured and sold by a company called Factory Direct Sales.", "unixReviewTime": 1428969600}

I use these shirts for casual days; ranging from lounging around the house and hiking trails to observe land. I used to wear Fruit of the Loom (and I swear by them!) but they are sometimes on the expensive side- rightfully so. For a cheap, awesome shirt however, these work amazingly!!\n\nThey will certainly not hold up to much abuse as a thicker cotton shirt (or Carhartt). I anticipate them having a lot fewer wash cycles (lifespan) due to their thinness, but I just need something to cover over my manly parts (where I work, you can't work shirtless). Initially they are deep in color, but after the first wash they did not fade really at all.  At least I don't have to worry about my shirts as much- now that money spent on them is less of a hindrance. Cheap shirts feel liberating. And ones like this are amazing!

I purchased this keychain solely based on the print and the fact that I can clip it basically anywhere- my purse, my jeans, the dog leash, etc. I also love that it doesn't scream Vera Bradley. It might be a simple thing, but this keychain is awesome. My vehicle uses a smart key and the convenience of leaving this snapped on my purse great, but it's simple enough to remove when I get home and need to unlock the front door. The coated cotton material is easy to wipe if it gets soiled. It's well made and substantial and I hope to be able to use it for many years to come.

If you carry a lot of books, tech or layers, this might not be the bag for you. Stitching all seems to be holding up well. This is not made for someone without junk in the truck, stuff in the stomach or extra under the arms, however. The straps are very stiff and sometimes pinch under my arms. It does rest well on my back (doesn't sit on my tailbone). It has LOTS of lovely pockets. However I wish it had a dual zipper for the top pocket because I'm super lazy and having to zip the entire bag open just to get out something quick smacks of effort my elders would chide me for not having. Zippers stick a lot when you first get it but have eased up over time. Leather at the top of each of the front pockets is problematic as it makes it difficult to zip the pockets open and shut easily. But that might be a fault of poor design/stitching. But this isn't enough to make the bag a no go. Not waterproof even a little. But some canvas  and seam spray seal would help that.\n\nTLDR\nPros:\nNice size\nWell made straps (so far)\nLots of nice pockets.\nDidn't have horrible chem smell when I took it out of the packaging (it's a thing, really)\nDurable (so far)\nZippers are metal and are holding up well\n\nCons:\nDay pack with size limitations.\nZippers are stiff and take some tugging to use (but ease with use)\nNot water proof\nStraps are stiff and wide\nWish it had a side pocket for a water bottle or small folding umbrella\n\nI'll update if anything goes wrong in the coming months.", "summary": "Zipper died after 6 months", "unixReviewTime": 1461196800}

Only one bad thing was that there was a bad brown stain on the back of the chiffon - but a tide stick took out the stain and then a gentle hand wash to remove the watermark and it is just perfect for an $18 dress.

We didn't want to buy all 7 in case the dress wasn't the quality we were hoping for.  Thankfully, we made the right decision.  This dress is made from a material that is see through.  The top of the dress is basically see through lace.  Then there is some coverage from the bra line down to about 4 inches above the knee, where an underlay dress is sewn inside - that's gotta be the strangest thing and it makes you wonder WHAT were they thinking???  The exterior flowing portion of the dress is again all see through, but it goes all the way down to the ground.  Why wouldn't you sew the underlay down to the same level as the exterior, especially when it's going to be blatantly see through and you will be able to see only a short skirt underneath?  It looks absolutely ridiculous.  The fabric came apart slightly in the back just from her trying it on as the zipper is sticky, which makes it difficult to maneuver and easy to damage.  I'm not sure what we'll do with it.  I figure we'll try to be creative and see if we can purchase extra fabric or find a very long slip to wear beneath, but I'm not sure it will be something we'll be able to salvage.  We learned our lesson on this one!  Also, the shipping takes quite a while.  When they say it's going to take a while, it really will take a while to come in.

After spending several minutes to untie the knot, it gets so frayed that it may break after repeating the process 2 or 3 times.\n\nBecause these pants cost more than others Champion sells, I was expecting a slightly better product than others they sell. While I have some other Champion sweat pants I purchased several years ago, I can't fathom why they didn't simply continue selling those and changed their design...doing so was a very poor decision on Champion's part.

I went out to My Orders to check on a book I'd ordered for a friend only to find that I could look to be receiving this mala the next day! Well, knock me over with a feather -- I hadn't known  I'd ordered any mala, though I'd had malas on my mind and had been looking at them recently, and had put one I liked on my wish list. Still, I'm very familiar with ordering on line, and don't have the one touch activated.  I sat, chin in hand and thought, maybe this is one of those instances where you need to concede that the Universe is alive and well, and you might now come back to chanting mantras (used to, mala stolen in purse robbery 25 yrs. ago ) so I thought I'd see about this particular mala. It arrived as stated, and I looked it over, and decided yes, I will keep this, and I think I am meant to have it.  I probably would never have ordered a mala strung on elastic, but with careful and respectful use, I think they will hold up just fine. I got the Tree of Life bead marker by default, and like using that when I can't complete the full 108 beads at one sitting.  The green sandalwood is probably not from the sandalwood family, and the scent -- who knows? It certainly isn't real sandalwood scent --  my loved and stolen mala was real sandalwood so I know the difference.  The beads themselves are quite beautiful with a lot of variation in the grain, and the greenish tone is much appreciated by me. So that's my take on these.  Nothing like some mystery to life, I say.", "summary": "Don't Know How I Got 'Em But They're Here to Stay", "unixReviewTime": 1513036800}

The front of the dress is rather flat so it is not too forgiving if you have tummy bulge/mummy tummy. The fact that the back is a corset (no zipper) will allow this dress to be cinched up as loose or as tight as you need in the torso...but you MUST have someone to do it for you. This dress is unfortunately way too long - even for me- I'm 5'11. The fact that this dress is difficult to put on & that it is too long are what made me give 3 stars. I ordered 2 dresses (from different brands on Amazon) with the intention of keeping the one that fit better so this one is being returned. The other dress fits perfectly in a size 10, so I know sizing varies. If you have a good, inexpensive tailor or are going to wear super high heels, this dress may be for you.

The fur inside is only on the ear flaps and extends about 2\" up in the rear. Other than that there is no fur inside, but the inside is fully lined. One of the two straps can be shortened, but the other has a fixed length of 3\".\n\nI'm an average size man and I think my head is average size, but this hat is really too large for me. When I first put it on, fur was partially obscuring my vision. Trimming back the front edge of the fur to the stitching helped here. For good warmth you want the ear flaps to pull tight to the face, but in my case that means pulling the two flaps nearly together under the chin, and the 3\" fixed strap length prevents this. If I push the hat back so I can clearly see, it will stay for a while before it needs another push, so it's OK for a job like hand snow shoveling, but not for driving.", "summary": "Nice hat, but too large on me", "unixReviewTime": 1422576000}

Yes this is obviously to be worn under other clothes, but it could stand to be a little bit thicker especially if you want it for a little girl who is sprouting already. I do not have that issue with my daughter just yet but I would not use these in that case.\n\nI received this item for free from a discount code posted on the listing.", "summary": "perfect for a little girl.", "unixReviewTime": 1456012800}

He could only see a slight difference in the brightness of some colors, but it wasn't enough of a change for the price.  Our colorblind grandson also tried them on and did not notice anything either, but that may be because he is 7 years old.  HOWEVER, I did not want to give these glasses a low rating just because they did not work for us. They work for LOTS of other people so give them a try.  With their 60 day money back guarantee if the glasses are still in good condition you cannot go wrong.  My husband has a severe case of color blindness so he only had a small percentage of a chance they would work for him.  That's not a reason for a low rating for the company.

It was a little smaller than I expected, but I'm a pretty petite person, so for a 22-year old female college student it was ok. I ordered the lavender color, but it is more vivid and brighter in person, more of a orchid color rather than a pastel. What mattered the most to me in this backpack was water bottle pockets, a laptop sleeve, fashionable design, and something waterproof. This checks all those boxes. The water bottle pockets have velcro on the inside, and are pretty small, which is kind of a pain, and the laptop sleeve is in the back, so it can be tricky to get a laptop in and out if you pack it full, but other than those slight grievances, this is awesome. I have carried this in the rain and nothing has seeped through into the inside at all. I also like the big front pocket. My laptop fits perfectly (I have a 15 in. If you have anything bigger it won't fit). I have been able to stuff a laptop, a change or clothes, lunchbag, and textbooks. It was tight, but it worked. It also came with a cute little pencil case!

Purchase the black one.\nDelivery: Ordered 7/7 and was delivered 7/10.\nPackaging: Great, no complaints.\nSetup: Easy to use with English user guide.\nFunctions:\n- Date/Time/Temp: Updated via syncing with the app.\n- Steps: Accurate.\n- Calories: The app is able to calculate your idle calories and will then add up the burned calories to give you a total amount.\n- Distance moved: I guess this is calculated via how many steps youve taken.\n- Cycling: Only available after updating the firmware. Does not work with stationery cycling as nothing was registered after my spinning class.\n- Minutes: How many minutes youve moved, guess this is also calculated via how many steps youve taken.\n- Idle time: Ive set this to 1hr, and it will alert me if Ive been sitting for that long.\n- Sleep Mode: Before firmware update, sleep mode was accessible by 2 long presses. After firmware update, sleep mode is only accessible via the app.\n- Stop watch time: Before firmware update, the timer was only accessible via the app. After firmware update, the time is accessible by 2 long presses.\n- Alarm: This can be set via the app.\n- Caller alert: Need to have BT always ON on your phone, but Ive noticed the wristband only alerting me after the phone has rung a few seconds already.\n- Heartrate: The wristband itself cannot monitor your heartrate. The app does have this function and how it calculates your heartrate is by asking you to place your finger on your phones camera. Quite interesting, though I cant say how accurate this is.\n- SMS alert: Cannot comment as I haven't tested this function.\nBattery: Lasts about 8-9 days straight. Charging takes about 1hr.\nWaterproof: Ive only run it under the tap after the gym, no issues here. Have not tested it in the pool.\nSize: I have a very small wrist and the wristband is able to fit me well.\nDisadvantages:\n- As Ive mentioned above, it does not record my time from my spinning classes.\n- As I sit in the office all day typing on a keyboard, the paint has started to come off the clip that locks the wristband from scratching against the surface of my desk.\n- Before updating the firmware, I found that the wristband restarted on its own one night while it was in Sleep Mode, thus it lost some data. This has only happened once so far, not sure if the firmware update fixed it or not.\nQuestions: Ive found that sometimes the wristband will vibrate and a picture of a fist showing up.

This chart is completely accurate and if you wear one of these sizes, you should follow it:\n\nXL = UK 16 = US 12\n2X = UK 18 = US 14\n3X = UK 20 = US 16\n4X = UK 22 = US 18\n\nI would normally wear a 16, and the description did say to size up, so I ordered a 2X (which is sizing up from a 16 under normal circumstances).  But here, the 2X is equivalent to a US 14. Nowhere is this stated, which is ridiculous.  Why can't Amazon just PUT UK 18 (or US 14) instead of 2X in the drop down menu?  Otherwise, I have no idea if the 2X is according to UK sizing or if it has been converted to US sizing already.\n\nHad it been listed this way, I would have known that the 2X / 14 was a bit of a long shot for me as my bust measurement makes it difficult for me to wear below a dress size 16.  As it is, the dress won't quite zip on me and I will be sending back.  I'm ok with this, I just don't understand WHY the accurate size can't be listed in the drop down menu.

I received these as a free gift when I purchased my Vero Monte no show socks for my Tieks and I am in love! The no show socks were great, and so are these! The material is fantastic - very soft, which is a surprise because socks like this that I have had in the past have been sort of rough. No these - they are soft and the perfect thickness. They don't feel so thick that your shoes fit tighter, but I really like the way they feel under my boots.\nAnother pro - I am very picky about seams in my socks. I find that often the seam irritates my toes and I have to either turn them inside out or take them off altogether. The seams on these are perfect, I spent the entire day in them (12+ hours on my feet) with no irritation or even marks when I took them off! If you struggle with the seams hurting you, these are great!\nAlso, the packaging was so cute for these! They came nicely rolled and wrapped in a box with tissue paper, which actually gave me the idea to order some as gifts because who doesn't like socks?! I've already recommended them to my friends/coworkers, who also purchased the no show socks based on my recommendation.\n\nMy socks will definitely be coming from Vero Monte from now on.

I am typically between a US M and a L, depending on the cut of the shirt. In this case, I definitely should've got the XL/L, as this shirt is a bit clinger than I would like, possibly due to the cheap jet set/polyester lining.\n\nOverall, the design is super cute and I'm sure I would like it if it was a size larger and didn't cling to my belly. :/ Additionally, the quality is not great (but for the price, I suppose you're not expecting high quality). The lining is simply serged around the bottom--not folded and stitched like a well finished garment would be--and because of this, the lining tends to roll up, particularly in the back, which doesn't look great.

The fabric is soft and silky, lightweight yet sturdy, and not at all see-thru. My waist is 28\", my hips are 36\", and the small fits me perfectly. Since I need an inseam longer than average but shorter than \"tall\", I just love that these are made long and designed to be cut to your desired length - no sewing required! The length on the black pair I received measures 32\" and the printed pair measures 33\", but the weight and stretch of the fabric causes them to drape about 1 1/2\" longer when you have them on - so they are closer to 33 1/2\" and 34 1/2\".  Best of all: I have some tummy troubles, so I wear them with the fold-over not folded over, which brings it up to my bra. This gives me a smoother line through my midsection, helps control the jigglies (slightly), is still comfortable when I get bloated, and yet is not at all tight or binding like a compression garment. That, right there, is priceless! With repeated washings these do get looser, so to extend their lifespan I wash them in cold water and wouldn't dream of putting them in the dryer. If/when these do lose elasticity, I plan on getting more wear out of them by then wearing them as intended (folded over).

The price was so reasonable I thought it would not be what we really wanted quality wise but we were on a budget money and time wise and I wanted something more modest than most dresses I had been viewing.  We were thrilled when the package came with a beautifully made dress.  It looks great on her.  The color is a little more mint green than in the picture but we were prepared for a variation-- it is still lovely and no regrets. The buttons on the back make it look exquisite.  We were also worried it would not arrive in time (May 1) since I ordered it kind of late.  But once it shipped, it was here in no time.  Couldn't be more pleased.  We ordered according to the size chart to fit her waist since she is smaller on top.  We will have to have the top altered a bit to fit but it is better than the waist not being big enough.  So order to fit the largest area of your body size wise and alter the rest accordingly.

It makes my \"gals\" look nice and perky, which after having 2 kids, is no easy task! The straps are adjustable and do so easily. I was able to find a great fit with minimal work on the straps. It has 3 hook and eye closures in the back. They stay closed all day without any trouble. The plunging neck line makes this a great choice to wear with a low neck dress or blouse.\nI have washed and dried this bra several times already. It is holding up great! Each time I washed it in a laundry bag and hung to dry. The underwire is not poking through at all! I will say that this does run small. I would recommend carefully reading the sizing instructions and take that into consideration. I ordered a cup and one size bigger and it fits great.\nOverall, this super sexy bra is wonderful!

I was wrong. While I still rely on my phone's clock this watch is perfect for camping, hiking and similar activities.\n\nOne of the things that I love is the fact that it has the look of an analog watch, but is brimming with digital features as well. I mention the analog part because at 66 (at the time of this review) I grew up in an era where all watches were analog and there is an imprinted relationship between the position of the hands and the time of day. I suspect many folks in my age group can 'visualize' time better that way.\n\nOf course, the biggest draw for me is the price. If I were to break or lose this watch I am not going to have an anxiety attack. Lose it I may, but I doubt if this think will break easily. It's water and dust proof, and seems to be relatively shock proof as well.\n\nIt's a bit large, but not unduly uncomfortable to wear, especially for the short periods that I use it.

It's a shiny silver necklace with a dark black pawprint. However, whoever designed the \"fill kit\" (tiny funnel) for this doesn't understand how cremated remains work. They are not a uniform size. Sometimes there are slightly larger chunks, making it difficult to get the remains through the excessively long, tiny funnel end. Unless their goal was to add a lot of stress and pain to an already painful occurrence by forcing the owners of deceased pets to painstakingly cram their pet's remains into a tiny locket with their fingers, they have failed at their job. It took me a good 45 minutes to get this tiny chamber filled, and I had to use my fingers. I'm not squeamish, but I know that plenty of people would not be comfortable having their dead dog's ashes all over their fingers and work area. I also don't mind having lost a little bit of my girl, but I bet some people would.\n\nIF you have already purchased this, here is my suggestion for filling. Discard the funnel. It will clog and become a nuisance immediately and repeatedly. Prop the urn up so it sits (securely) vertically however you can. Get an index card. Scoop a *very* small amount of your pet's remains onto it. Sort through the remains looking for larger bits that won't make it through the opening of the charm. Move those elsewhere with tweezers or something. crease the card and gently pour the remains into the urn over a piece of paper (to catch what doesn't go into the opening). You will probably need a needle or similar tool to sort of coax the ashes to fall in. Repeat until full.", "summary": "\"Fill kit\" (tiny funnel) is awful!", "unixReviewTime": 1442102400}

I won't lie; when I received it, I contemplated sending it back. It ended up growing on me though. The leather is nice and it's an overall beautiful bag. And it's very roomy. It could actually be used as a weekender. For anyone wondering, the hardware is gunmetal. I like that; wasn't wanting goldtone.\n\nSo, why not 5 stars? Well:\n\n1. It doesn't have a top zipper. But the straps are actually functional where they pull in the \"wings\" and secure the bag just like the real phantom.\n\n2. The lining is a vinyl material. It isn't thin though.\n\n3. I wish it had more pockets. It only has one zipper pocket inside, and one on the outside.\n\n4. The bottom of the bag seems to bow a little bit when items are placed in it. Wish the bottom construction was more sturdy.\n\n5. The feet are black plastic. I hoped that they would be the same metal used for the hardware.\n\nI'm actually used to carrying brands such as MK and Coach normally, but this bag is proving that it can definitely stand on its own. I love the fact that I can throw everything in it and keep on going.\n\nJust a note: be careful of stretching out the zipper pockets. I can't get the inside pocket to zip normally right now; the teeth come apart after being zipped.", "summary": "Nice Phantom Dupe...", "unixReviewTime": 1453248000}

Since I am not at all chesty, I can wear it, and although it is not padded or push-up, it is slightly low and gives a little cleavage if you want. Or if it slips down, lol. I have a wee bit of \"back fat\" so I am not super slim, but compared to many women I am on the slimmer side, especially since I am middle aged. If you are at all busty, this is not the top for you!!!!!! I got the cherry colored one and it is very very pretty. I sometimes wear it with an open sweater or under something with the top popping out. At home I just wear it with nothing else. I'm happy with the purchase but it is definitely on the small side, so I'm glad I sort of am too.", "summary": "Would Not Fit A Chesty Woman", "unixReviewTime": 1430611200}

The setting does have some height to it, a little more than I expected but I still love it. My wedding bands I will wear with it are kinda thin but there's room for a chunkier band. This real gem is really quite a gem!

It was the right choice, there was NO extra room at all, so I would recommend going bigger than your normal size.\nI am 5,10 and surprisingly, it was the perfect length - no hills though. this is always an issue being tall and buying long dresses, they stop around my ankles and that looks awful.\nThe dress itself is nice and looks good, but mine had some essential flaws that made me return it!\n1 - the zipper - annoying and clearly something that would give me problems. Also, the description says \"Back: Zipper\". There is no back zipper, only one on the side.\n2 - I thought my boob was showing a bit too much. The cup would cover it when someone looked straight at me, but from my side, I thought people could see more than I wished to show.\n3 - the champagne lace thing (there are no stone application or anything, it is all fabric) works beautifully with the fabric, but mine was not properly centered in the dress, which made it look cheaply made - this was my biggest no-no of all of them. If I paid $40, I would get it, but for $100, not a chance!!! The applications were not straight and definitely not symmetric, which, again, made it look cheap (the ones around the hips, not the bottom)\nI do have a couple good things to say about it, which justify my three stars, even though I chose to return it\n1 - the color was very true to what the picture showed, which was nice\n2 - the fabric hugged my body and it made the silhouette really nice, curvy where it should be, but in a classy way\n3 - the bottom is beautiful. Sadly, not enough to compensate for the other flaws.\nBasically, I returned it because I thought that, for this price, it was not worth it. They have some options in most sizes with free returns. If, like me, you think it would look great and want to chance it, I would recommend trying one of those. The returning process takes a while, but I knew I would not stop thinking about it until I put it on :)\nI hope this helps you!", "summary": "Not worth $100, but not the worst dress ever", "unixReviewTime": 1439856000}

It fit perfectly in the waist and hips and the length was perfect, right under my knees.  I have another dress from this company that I love.  The material was not too thick and not too thin.  The color is a very nice teal as pictured.  I really liked the neckline, it's low but still classy, without being too revealing.  Sad that I have to return it due to sizing.", "summary": "Very cute, classy dress, but too big for my petite frame.", "unixReviewTime": 1453766400}

I would highly suggest paying attention to the size chart from the seller & not the amazon size chart. measurements are accurate  -the fabric is stretchy & clingy & it is also a nice weight not thin at all :) the only con i have about this dress is that if  you have some problem areas (bumps lumps rolls - i think we all have a few of those) i would recommend some good control undergarments to smooth out those areas as the clingy fabric might accentuate them however not too much it really just depends on your build. I have booty hips & thighs a slight tummy bulge & ample boosum so its in a lot of the right places the positive about the make of this dress is that the semi-peplum fold over near the waist an help to hide some of that tummy bulge but not alot. the way the top is cut really accentuates \"the girls\" (my cleavage) and it a looks awesome. the only thing is, it  isn't lined so some of the extra fabric shows a line underneath but its not horrible, if it bugs u too much u could always cut off the additional fabric in those areas.

For the price, its a good value.  However....the fabric is rather flimsy, I cannot see it holding together well over repeated uses. The bottoms were ok, but the fabric is so thin, I see these having a hard time staying up, especially if you are in the water or saying, walking around, etc.  The top was better made, it wasn't as thin as the bottom. To me, the biggest drawback on this suit was the fringe.  The way it hangs, it basically draws the entire focal point of the suit straight to your belly. And if you are like me, and don't have the super flattest belly in the whole world....then it just accentuates any problem areas you might have around your middle. For me, it was rather comical, almost like a big fringe-y arrow pointing right at my troublesome belly.  I have never had this problem with a suit before. Maybe cutting the fringe would help with that, but then the top would just look odd.\n\nSo its going back.  I wanted fun and sexy for my Vegas trip, and this did not deliver.\n\nAlso, another reason for the 3-stars... this suit did NOT come with a sanitary liner in the bottoms.

If I put it at my top rib its stops at the middle of my ankles.\nStyling: Even though most of the reviews say that the straps are too big, that is not the case for me. I have a 28' waist and it will only wrap around me twice maybe (depending on the style). They are really thick though but I like the coverage.\n\nI bought this dress as a test for my bridesmaids.

I find the interior of the pocket to be reasonable and it fits my Samsung S5 phone. However, I can't put my hands in my pockets if they get cold because the opening is small and the zipper scratches my hands. While I don't have tiny cabbage hands, I also do not have giant man hands. I would say I am average handed. I can get my hand in minus the thumb but if I squeeze in Mr. Thumbkin I really have to work to get my hands out and it becomes painful. I enjoy the hood and the snaps to keep my neck warm. The length is just right to cover my rather ample bottom. The sleeves have some kind of poly fabric lining while the body has faux shearling. This is pretty ingenious because it means your layers don't bunch when your putting this hoodie on. The sleeve lining is slippery and allows those pesky primary and secondary layers to remain unaffected by your need for yet a third layer. This is perfect for fall and moving into winter. Follow their size chart. I normally wear a large/xl and I ordered this in xxxl. I have room for layers but I wouldn't say this is an over sized fit having sized up so much.", "summary": "I want to love this hoodie.", "unixReviewTime": 1443657600}
