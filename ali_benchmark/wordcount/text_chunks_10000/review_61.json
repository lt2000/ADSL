Since the purse was stuffed tight in my mailbox (not the seller's fault, that's on my mail lady) the purse now won't sit up completely straight without like creasing. Other than those two complaints, I love it. The color is beautiful, the size is perfect, not to big not to small, and the quickness of the product.

Also, she had never worn a little heel before, so these made her feel very grown up.\nMy only complaint (which is why I docked a star) is that, as is often the case in beauty, they weren't very comfortable.  Once she arrived at the dance, she took them off after a few minutes of being on the dance floor and they mostly sat by her chair the rest of the night.  She tried to put them on a couple of times to dance in (because they were just so pretty!) but ended up taking them off after a minute or two.

This hat, however, does the trick just wonderfully. Thick material for protection. Material is some sort of nylon-ish blend, I think, and has held up for two months so far with getting pretty wet and having lots of sun exposure. Color has stayed fairly bright as well. An extra bonus was that its bendable/crushable, so i can stuff it in my swimming basket and not worry about ruining it that way either. It flattens back out fairly well.\n\nI might have to buy another color or two next summer to go with future new swimming suits.

They are super comfortable and I get so many compliments when I wear them I decided to get them in black as a gift to myself for Christmas.  I ordered them in a size 6 1/2 since I know that is my size.  I received the boots, box said size 6 1/2 and I wrapped them up and put them under the Christmas tree, did not try them on, why should I.  Opened them at Christmas, threw all the packaging away.  When I went to wear them a few days later I noticed that the right boot was a little tight.  My right foot is my larger one so I did not think much of it, plus when I purchased my original pair the sales woman total me that I might want to size down as they are real leather and stretch, which they did.  I figured that after wearing the new black ones a few times they would stretch some and would fit fine.  OH NO, they did not and I get a blister on my right heal when I wear them.  I even tried wearing thick socks and using a hot blow dryer to heat them up and walk around the house to stretch them to no avail.  So today, I just happened to cross my legs in a way that I could see the bottom of the boots, they both say size 6 on the bottom, not sizes 6 1/2.  I took both boots off and looked in side.  The left boot says 6 1/2, the right says 6.  Now I know why the right foot is so tight, WRONG SIZE!  And now it is to late to return them.

They are great for the beach or walking around, but if the surface is super smooth and wet then these shoes can be pretty slippery.

Second, when I tried to return it, the seller denied me because \"most people like this style\". I am NOT \"most people\". Then they offered to give me a $3 refund. $3??!! That's not even 30% of the original price! I was able to talk them up to giving me $8 back for the product that I was forced to keep, that I will never be able to wear unless I get back to my high school weight (which is just ridiculous - I actually love my womanly body). On top of all that, the order was misplaced, so amazon gave me a refund to reorder everything. Well, the original order was found, so now I have TWO of these bathing suits, of which I cannot return. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE! When I got the second bathing suit, I noticed that it was NOTHING like the first one. These are supposed to be the same bathing suit! They were two different colors, made out of two different materials, different designs (one had a hook back and the other was attached all the way - one didn't even come with padding!), and the sizing was inconsistent too!

We requested that the dress be made with no sequins, beading or trim. We, also, asked that the dress be made long with the addition of a short train.  We sent in her measurements and it was spot on!\nOnce we received the dress we added the Swarovski crystal trim around the neck and sleeves. Then we added the crystal appliqus to the front and back bodice. Finally, we attached a wide crystal belt/band to 2 1/2\" wide grosgrain ribbon to make the sash.  The dress was beautiful and the bride stunning. It was exactly what my daughter had pictured in her mind!!! Thank you Dressystar for contributing to my daughters special day!", "summary": "Perfectly pleased!", "unixReviewTime": 1469664000}

They'd need to be opened and re-stuffed to make them look like ears.\n\nDon't bother buying this.

My right shoe started making this loud clicking noise when I walked. It was embarrassing. I literally had to alter the way I stepped down so it didn't make the noise. Ridiculous. Also, these flops are made a bit small and cause my feet to swell if I'm in them too long. I don't even know if I can return them. It's so late in the season I'll just buy the other pair I was contemplating next Spring.\n\nUpdate: September 11th - a little more than a month (received these on Aug 4th) this happened (see photo).

My main concern with this dress was that the beading and fabric look a little on the cheap side.  I've certainly see worse, especially when it comes to beading, but I was hoping for something a bit nicer.  I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing this dress to a nice event - I think I would feel too cheap, even if the fit was stellar (which it was not...).\n\nI liked the back - the straps looked pretty - but the straps were a bit too spacious on me, so they ended up draping a bit.  That said, I'm quite slender and small-busted so this might not be a problem for everyone (or for all sizes of the dress).\n\nFloor-length gowns tend to look good on me because I am long and lean (5'8, 115 lbs), but this style was not flattering for my body types.  The lack of defined waist made me look shapeless.  Again, maybe not a problem for every body type though.  The dress does not flare out as in the photo.  It was more of a straight line with a subtle flare.  The model's stance makes it look like more of a mermaid style than it actually was.\n\nFit issues did not factor into my rating.

I felt compelled to write a review for this item because it is so impressive.\n\nI will say that this shirt may not fit everyone perfectly- The design of blouse's waistband may not lay at everyone's waistline and may fit more like an empire style depending on the length of your torso and also the size of your bust. On me it falls somewhere in between my underbust and waistline, but is much closer to my waistline.\n\nIf your build is not as petite as the model wearing it in the photo above, then I would advise ordering up at least two sizes. I actually purchased this blouse first in the size 4, which was a little tight. Then I purchased it is the size 8, which was definitely looser, yet not an undesirable look if that's how you like your clothing to fit. However I have re-ordered this blouse in the size 6 which, based on how the other two sizes fit, should be a perfect fit. After I receive the size 6 blouse, I will update my review to share the fit information.\n\nIn accordance with the other reviewers' opinions, it is an understatement to say that this blouse is high quality for the price. In my opinion, it is extremely high-quality compare to other blouses I've paid $100 or more. The shade of pink is an absolutely perfect 'petal' pink, in the material feels like silk! It's the perfect shirt  it can be worn for a casual/dressy look with jeans, or for a more dressy office or going out look- depending on how you accessorize it. I actually just ordered the green and white in addition to the pink in size 6 even though I've not tried the 6 on yet. Going by how the size 4 and size 8 fit, I'm pretty confident that the size 6 will fit just right. And if it doesn't I can just return them and wear the size 8 as a more loose, flowy style or take it to the tailor and have it taken in around the waist to look more fitted.\n\nI know how difficult it is to buy clothing online bad get the perfect fit- especially the first time you order something- but, if this style appeals to you at all I would suggest ordering up two sizes and if it's too large for you don't like the way it fits then take it to a seamstress or tailor and have it altered-- it's totally worth it the small fee of having a seamstress alter it because the blouse is a STEAL at this price! I swear The quality of this blouse feels like that of an Equipment blouse or another high end designer! Now I just wish they had it in black too!", "summary": "Perfectly Pink at a Price You Can't Beat!!", "unixReviewTime": 1461715200}

So far I've just used it in the summer around the house for my man. He loves it on me... But he wouldn't be thrilled if I ever left the house in it haha. I would recommend ordering like 2-3 sizes up. And to be honest it will show every flaw, so if you are insecure about cellulite or anything, this probably isn't the skirt for you.\n\nI don't think I would order this again, unless I could get the sizing right and even then it would probably be reserved for the poolside.

That't to be expected though, for some reason a shirt that actually fits in the chest is always too short on the arms.  But also, when I moved my arms the shirt is very tight around the arm holes and the shoulder area, which is odd because it's very baggy in the chest and stomach.  As an open, flowing shirt it works well, but it's uncomfortable to tuck in.  The material feels nice, which it had better for the price.

Out of the box, it looks good and the quality is obvious. However, you can never get away from the fit issue and I am not referring to the waist.\n\nNo matter what your waist size, the contour package is unusually designed and way too small. Take a look at the photo provided. The contour is a  vertical pocket that is very small.  It really feels that this product is not made to accommodate an American male. So while you can find a fit for your waist, the fit issue becomes even more dicey.\n\nIn this regard, even should your shaft fit into this very small pocket, you have two other things to worry about.  Where are they supposed to go?  Further, even on top of this issue, the photo doesn't reveal that the front of the suit is more of a male's micro thong. If it wasn't contoured for a \"shaft only\" man, it would probably fit an woman very well. For her it would probably be a relief from a small size of a micro thong especially if her slit  happens to rise above the top of a micro thong.\n\nSo the front is lower than the rear coverage contributing to the lack of room in the front. At best, the front sits just on top of the base of your shaft.  While at first that might appealing, but there is a price to pay. The fits causes a number of other issues that are unsolvable including the de minimus length of the vertically contoured product. (If you adjusted your shaft up, nothing would remain behind in the pocket).  Also, the one inch sides automatically roll into a string creating the additional potential for a difficult fit.  I am not talking about it rolling up because of belly fat. I have none but it just is not wide enough to hold its shape and seems to have a memory built in to roll up. Strings sink into any skin/fat you have unless pure muscle is under it. Women more easily get away with it because we appreciate a woman's body and know that a six pack is not to be expected. So for a firm woman, a slight sinking in of the string is to be admired as sexy. For a man, well you just look fat.  If you still want a true g-string, you would be better off buying one that was designed as such which hopefully takes into consideration the geometry of a male and his parts.\n\nIf they just raised the front about an inch or two it would still be a hot suit which would provide more front room. Also, unless you want a g-string cutting across a region that might be difficult for most American males, you will continue to have a problem. So, they also need to figure out what width \"string\" will hold its shape; if the front is raised, as I referred to, the string might cut in a better region as the angles will change with the redesign of the micro patch into a little larger one.", "summary": "Doesn't take into account a male's three part needs.", "unixReviewTime": 1428796800}

If you're typically a size small or medium you could try ordering the large or extra large.  While dimensions are listed in the description, I just assumed from the picture this item would fit loosely and drape in a loose way.  Never assume.  Next time I'll read the description dimensions more carefully.  If you wear a large or extra large this product isn't for you.  This product is clearly sized for a population other than the USA.  I'm afraid shipping costs make returns prohibitive.  In addition, the fabric is extremely light...almost like chiffon or super thin rayon, which matches the description title, but the picture led me to assume the fabric would be a bit heavier.  Definitely not outerwear, or an item you would layer over anything with sleeves.  Could be a light summer cardigan, but don't expect the draping shown in the picture.  In person it was shorter than I expected after looking at the picture.  The beige color was a very pretty pink/beige, but the fit made this a 1 star item for me.", "summary": "Way too small!  \"Plus\" should not be in the description.", "unixReviewTime": 1438819200}

Ordered on March 17th, 'twas delivered on the 23rd and my freight forwarder delivered it to me today (31st).\n\nBought a size 2, smallest size they had and if you check their size chart, that means 32.5\" bust, 25.5\" waist and 35.75\" hip. My measurements are 31\"-23.5\"-34.5\". So naturally I thought I would have to have it tailored somehow. However, it fits me exactly. Not like a glove and not slack. It just fits.\n\nRegarding material. It's quite thick as it has to be able to hold all the appliques. It's sturdy.\n\nRegarding the length. I'm 5'3.5\" and with a 5\" heel, the front of the dress skims a mere quarter of an inch from the floor. The train at the back extends out, I would say about 18\" from my feet.\n\nI bought this in dark black. I honestly don't know what the difference is compared to the regular black one besides the price difference and the photo used. I didn't want to chance it because the pictures of the dark black dress was what caught my eye. The gold beading is not very gold, but it's not as light as champagne.\n\nThe front is see through, from the waist up, but it's just as shown in the photos, so no surprises there. There are two padded circle bra cups on the inside. I'm a shy one sometimes, don't like feeling too exposed and these do an excellent job covering you without having to worry at all. I'm a small C cup. The see through part is a skin color see through material. Not black see through.\n\nLastly, be prepared to lose the stick on beads where ever you go. So please, no crimes in this dress, they'll easily know it was you lol\n\nPhotos were taken with flash and without. The ones without were taken in a room with warm white lighting.", "summary": "Prettiest Dress I own", "unixReviewTime": 1428105600}

I couldn't have picked a better dress for the ball that I attended.\nI strongly recommend ordering the size you're suppose to. I order 14/16 - 14 if I am trying to be cute or it runs big and 16 when I am being an adult, ordering my proper size. The gold trim is very elegant. It doesn't take over or overpower the dress. There is a built in section for your boobs. I would recommend having that section reinforced if you have a large bust. I attempted to wear a strapless bra under, but ended up not doing so because it didn't look right. Don't worry... the detail on the front covers your boobs, so you have some \"coverage\" should you pop out of the part intended for them. The train is LONG! I loved it. The material is kinda heavy. It gave some weight to the dress, which was reassuring.\nI strongly recommend doing the express shipping. For the price that you pay for the dress and the express shipping, you can't beat it.

Its design and workmanship are not first class. Its two shoulder belts are made of two layers of thick leather, which is good in terms of durability. But the metal loops at the bottom of the bag are too small for one of belts to go through . It took me a lot of efforts to push it through (The paint on leather is a bit sticky). Most worrisome is that the leather that holds these metal loops at the bottom are made of only one thin layer of leather (The thickness of the leather over the whole bag is not even). That makes the thick belts all unnecessary because the thin leather down there will break first when the weight in the bag exceeds certain level. A sensible design should double the layers of the leather holding the metal loops too.\n\nThe positions of holes on the strap of the top flap are too low. I have had to puncture three more holes myself. Overall the leather is thick and heavy. But I think it is too heavy for a backpack to carry around.

It is actually between the leg length of a trunk and a brief; very short.\n\nThe fabric is soft, comfortable, and stretchy. Allowing for plenty of flexibility to move without constriction. The leg holes are the perfect amount of tightness/looseness (against the skin without being tight) and there is plenty of room in the seat of this underwear (without having fabric sag on your behind).\nThe waistband is smooth, comfortable, and durable. I did not experience any roll over with this waistband.\nI would say there is no leg ride up with this underwear, but the legs are so short there is really no place to ride up.\nThe pouch is the best feature.  It offers plenty of room and stretch, while offering excellent support.\nThere is no seam running down the back middle of this pair of underwear, which is a nice change of pace from other N2N brand underwear (no wedgies from a seam).\nThis is really a great pair of underwear, but I am deducting a star as these are clearly not a boxer.\n\n-In Short-\nPros:\nComfortable, soft, and stretchy fabric\nComfortable, smooth, and durable waistband\nExcellent pouch with plenty of room and support\nlook good on\n\nCons:\nLeg length is way to short to be considered a boxer.\n\n*Please click \"Yes\" if you found this review helpful.

It keeps my hair fairly dry and keeps it from getting mussed up while in the water. It's not the kind of cap that keeps your hair perfectly dry; rather it's much like a watch that is water resistant, but not waterproof. It keeps my hair dry during water aerobics where there's splashing and a bit of dipping under water, but for swimming where your head is underwater most of the time, it would help from getting your hair wet, but it wouldn't keep it completely dry. It's a heavy cap made with thick material (I'm not sure, but I believe it is latex - that might be a drawback if you're allergic). It has a rim on the inside to keep the cap from slipping on your head.\nI received this swim cap at a discount in exchange for my fair and honest opinion and review.

Occasionally, he can get called into the field, delivering medical equipment, and his shirts sometimes catch a snag or get roughed up, etc.\n\nI scoured a ton of reviews here on Amazon, searching for the best polos I could find for under $20 a piece... The less the better, lol, they do add up! I purposely chose a different color in each of the best rated, good valued polos I found for him. This way, if there were any he cared less for, it wouldn't be a huge deal (he is pretty picky!), and if he especially loved any, then I'd order more in those brands and cuts...\n\nWell, good news, this polo was a winner!  Smile. Happy wife! This one was less his favorite in fit and more so mine. Not too tight but nicely snug around his broad shoulders! The arms are cut a bit longer and its not as wide overall, compared to others.  I took some photos that show care instructions, collar, side slit (to show if it has one or not) and fit on him. This polo being 100% cotton was the heaviest weight of those we purchased.\n\nFor reference, he is 6' tall and weighs about 240 lb. I ordered and received it in an XXL. We feel this was an excellent value and would recommend it to others. Ordered it in Ash Grey and it arrived as advertised, a nice light grey, and washes up nicely. (We wash as instructed but hang dry all of his polos.)\n\nIn case anyone else happens to be looking for some good inexpensive polos...  A few others we purchased, aside from this one, and are happy with are as follows (I'm posting reviews with photos for those also):\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Classroom-Men-s-Short-Sleeve-Pique-Polo-Shirt/dp/B004OVDKZS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Classroom Men's Short-Sleeve Pique Polo Shirt</a>\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Port-Authority-Men-s-Silk-Touch-Polo/dp/B00MFQKQ0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Port Authority Men's Silk Touch Polo</a>\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/054x-Hanes-Adult-Comfortblend-Ecosmart-Jersey-Polo-054X/dp/B00KQQI04G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">054x Hanes Adult Comfortblend Ecosmart Jersey Polo 054X</a>\n\nI will update this review down the road should any hold up better than others.

Both the fez and bow tie were good quality. My only reason for the three stars is I am tired of Amazon product pictures and descriptions NOT matching up with the product. The fez and bow tie pictured are both bright red. I specifically wanted them both bright red. However, when I received the product the fez was bright red as pictured, but the bow tie is not- it is maroon. Had the sellers picture shown a maroon bow tie with a bright red fez, I would have bought a different set. As it is, I had to order another bow tie to match the red fez. I realize the 11th Doctor wears a maroon bow tie, but his fez MATCHES it. I am having a jacket made and I could only find a bright red lining for it, so I wanted the bow tie and fez to match the lining- in other words, to be bright red!

He had surgery done and metal plates inserted, and a lot of watches do not fit him anymore.  I know that some reviewers have mentioned the size of the band comes large, but this has worked in our favor!\n\nThe Chronograph Military Sports Black Stainless Steel Wristwatch has 3 sub-dials for the chronograph minute, and second, and the 24 hour indicator.  It comes with a cleaning cloth, as well as a pin pusher to adjust the size of the band.\n\nThe large face is stunning, and it complements my husband's wrist pretty well.  I like that it can glow in the dark, and the fact that it is water resistant.  There are no numbers with the number indicators, which reminds me of a very known watch that is many more times expensive than this one.  The black colored band definitely makes this watch look fancy.  Because of the style, this watch can be worn during business meetings, weddings, and pretty much any occasion.  This watch looks more expensive than (currently at $26.99), and if you go to a retail store, a watch like this would price much higher than that.  I have attached some close up photos to see some more detailing on the watch face and the band itself.\n\nP.S.

I scour the reviews for every item prior to agreeing with myself that I should buy it too. However, now and then an extremely cute item will pop up - completely unreviewed, with no one to vouch for its comfort, durability or fit. Despite the lack of feedback, there is every temptation to buy that item. To risk or not to risk...?\n\nI did. I couldn't resist the sexy plunge line, the romper-like appearance that preserved a more flirtatious feel with a skirt instead of pants, and the soft colour that I was sure would compliment my skin. I ordered size medium, according to the guide. I was so excited when the package came in. Here is what I found:\n\nThe Good: the material is super soft and silky, and the colour was true to what was advertised\n\nThe Bad: I don't know who the designer intended to clothe, but it felt like I was trying to put on a child's dress. Although there is a zip on the side, this hardly does anything for helping the top of the item to pass over one's shoulders. I managed to squeeze into it, only to find - unsurprisingly - that the zip would not budge. The front of the dress also gaps quite a bit - some clothing tape is certainly needed to ensure that you're only showing what you want to be showing. Now, I do not have particularly broad shoulders, and my waist is quite average, so this was a total disappointment.\n\nOverall: this is a gorgeous dress, so it's quite unfortunate that it could not fit. I haven't decided whether to gift it to someone else for Christmas, or try to sell it. It may not make much sense to attempt returning it. I would advise anyone interested to order a size up, but I have no idea if that will change the situation with regard to the top of the dress being unable to pass over the shoulders.

I kept in touch the whole time via email and they replied almost right away each time. However it didn't fit as expected but that was because I had lost some weight prior to prom due to food poisoning so I'm not sure if it would have fit or not if I didn't have it. But nevertheless the straps stuck out a lot which didn't look all to well. Also the material was very thick which in turn made the dress thick so it was hard to sit and I ended up ripping one of the lace but you can hardly notice and it made to dance and sit a lot bearable! Also I added beading on the dress since I believed there to be beading on it on the first place only to realize by looking further in the picture that there wasn't and added the perfect touch!

The dude that lives on the couch is a 38 in nearly everything, and some things a 36 (so typically US Large- XL). I ordered the XXL size and it fit him near perfectly. There was just enough space for him to get a finger or so in the waist band and the rest wasn't too tight, except it really hugged his booty! I do love the color and the tree design. The color is almost as pictured a sort of canary yellow and black.\n\nAlthough the pockets are mesh, the actual shorts are not lined with anything. That means the ol' twig and berries just goes flippity flopping all around in there if you don't wear something to holster them in. Wearing something under them may be a good idea too, as the material is pretty thin and will hug ones junk when wet. Also, it seemed to go a little translucent so HELLO Frank and beans!\n\nThere were a few strings hanging off the bottom that needed cut off. Not a huge deal, but often more quality items will not have as many strings left on them. Could also be an off day for the person in charge of that (string cutting has to be a boring job).\n\nI am giving these a 4 star rating. The size chart is accurate go large, but there really needs to be about another 2 inches booty room, unless you like seeing the outline of the crevice of doom. Also a lining would be nice to hold Bradford and the pair a little more steady and protect them from being seen as easily.\n\nI received this item at a reduced price for my fair, honest, and I hope somewhat fun review.

The others came first and I was totally freaking out.  But these fit just right, while the others look like \"shrunken hammer pants in shorts form\" where the bottom hem is skin tight to the point of being uncomfortable.  Now, I ordered 1-2 sizes up due to reviews of the product for both.  I don't know if the other is just cut differently or if I just have that bad of luck?  But I would say this one is much better than the green striped with the same pattern.  It makes me nervous that two essentially identical swim trunks could be so different.

I thought the palm trees would be a great fit for a tropical destination.  Before ordering I did read other reviews to see about sizing.

I am not sure even the XL would fit any larger than a 34 waist with room to move.  My husband likes the design and feel of the shorts which is extremely soft.  The downfall of this item is that there is NO lining.  I read that and made the decision to get the yellow/green vs the white.  The white you would most definitely be able to see straight through.  He is not too concerned because the shorts won't really be worn out in public and if he does wear them out to a public place he can wear something under them.\n\nMy best advice to anyone looking at these shorts is to definitely take the time to read the reviews so you have an idea of the sizing and what size to order.  It can be tricky when it is Asian to US sizing.\n\nThis product was received at a discount for my honest and unbiased review", "summary": "PLEASE check reviews about sizing before ordering!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1460419200}

A few things to note:\nI am 28f,  even fullness, somewhat shallow.\nI chose this swim top primarily because it looked like a similar cut to my Freya Marvel bras,  (which fit me SO WELL) And whaddaya know, I was right! A little more closed in on top, but otherwise a very close match. Personally I would say the fit is accurate, the band is a touch tighter than my bras, but I prefer that because I find swimwear loosens a bit in the water.\nSecond thing I want to note, this shipped FAST.

They are spot on. Maybe they once ran small and the seller has tweaked the sizing since the initial offering but they are definitely not small like I expected based on some customer's reviews.  I measured my son's foot (barefoot) as 6 inches which equals 15.24 cm (after I plugged it into online conversion calculator) which would closest to a size 8 according to the size chart. The size chart included in the listing is pasted below. I should have ordered a size 9 (16 cm according to size chart) by the seller's advice to go up one size for wide/fat feet which would have allowed plenty of room but I heeded other customers' warnings and ordered a 9.5. I don't see a 9.5 marked on the shoe...the bottom states 27/185 (which I'm assuming is foreign sizing). The shoes are a good half size or more too big but they are wearable with a pair or socks. I would return them for a 9 but they are not currently offered through Amazon Prime and would take a couple of weeks to arrive.

After ordering, I started to really worry that it was a scam (have friends who have bought things for \"great deals\" in China and never received them). I emailed the company, just really hoping that they would email me back, which they did within 30 mins! They assured me the dress would come in the window of time that I requested in my email (which was 5 weeks prior to the estimated delivery date). Still being the skeptic, I had talked myself into this being too good to be true and was preparing to make an appointment with a local bridal shop. To my surprise (I ordered the dress on Dec. 9), the dress arrived at my house YESTERDAY (Dec. 29)!  Tried it on, and it fits perfectly!! Too long, but I'm short! Definitely take the advice on here and measure yourself, the order the dress in a size bigger than your measurements!! That's what I did and it is perfect!!! Very well made and fantastic quality!

I gave it 4 stars because I do like it overall. However, it does not fit me. I got a large and it says a large fits sizes 12-14. I am a size ten. I could barely get it over my shoulders. I'd say it's more of a size 4-8 ...because of the fabric I was able to pull it down but it is so very tight.\nUpdate: Tried it on again and I have to say I really like it. I am 5'8 1/2 and 160 lbs with a tummy. I should have got an XL but being my first time ordering from China, I didn't know about the sizes running small..so that's on me. The dress is VERY clingy, at least on me and doesn't have the swing it does on the model. It's also a lighter color, but very pretty!! I love the length, it's very short. The fabric I love...just enough stretch. I am a 36/B, maybe c. It's also pretty see through, but with the right color underwear and bra it works. I love that I can wear any bra and you can't see the straps. Like I said though, it is a clinger. lol I wouldn't suggest it for people with a lot of meat, and it is NOT FREE FLOWING. I kind of look like a sausage. Can see my belly button right through it. Ok, adding photos. This dress is made for someone with a tight, toned figure. Even with an XL I'm not sure I could pull it off in public. Keeping it, because I hope to lose the winter weight around midsection and wear it....I do love it. One loose thread on the tummy area that I can fix. Seems to have been made pretty well. Over all glad I bought it for the price. I see a lot of reviews on other dresses about sizing and how it's not made well, but for under ten bucks and a weird sizing system..it's a gamble. Oh, it also came in less than two weeks. I'm satisfied and will be ordering more...maybe this one in white. Thanks :)", "summary": "SIZE is SMALL...beware, but VERY cute!", "unixReviewTime": 1432166400}

Its wedged heal is great for not only Olympic weightlifting but powerlifting as well. Although the cost of this shoe may be slightly higher than a similar product, you receive the quality brand that is paid for. The heel of the Romaelos II is also much sturdier than other competitive brands, such as the Adidas Adipower.\n\nLightweight\n\nThe weight of this shoe is another large reason it is a top of the line product. When the athlete wears the Romaelos II, there is little to no difference in the weight compared to an average tennis shoe. This proves to be a huge advantage to those performing Olympic lifts while wearing the Romaelos II in comparison to the lifters who may be wearing something else.\n\nComfort\n\nThe comfort of this show is remarkable, as the Romaelos II can be worn even when not needed during the workout. Another luxury of this weightlifting shoe is that the athlete may forget they are still wearing the shoe due how they feel. Beyond that, the shoe was smooth and easy to break in. Contrary to similar products, you can expect little to no pain when attempting to break in the shoe.\n\nVelcro Straps\n\nThe two hook-and-loop Velcro straps are a large advantage on the Romaelos II as the lock in the foot of the competitor throughout the entire workout. The top strap, although long when tightened, plays a significant role in the effectiveness of the workout because it secures the heel so well. With other shoes, some people have had trouble with their heel slipping out while doing lunges or even while performing a jerk. This top strap allows the lifter to complete their workout worry free of slippage ever happening. The second strap near the toes of the shoe simply allows you to tighten beyond what the laces may provide.\n\nDurability\n\nLastly, the durability of the Nike Romaelos II is extraordinary. For nearly 1 year, the shoes have held up and look as new as the day they were purchased even though they have worn at least 3 times per week throughout that time.", "summary": "Best Shoe in the Game", "unixReviewTime": 1455062400}

Sadly shortly after, the very cheap buttons began to pop off one by one. So I had to remove the buttons and replace with nicer quality ones. I ended up taking a chance and buying another pair (blue, small). I received them in the mail today; a little over a month after the order was placed. As soon as I took them out of the bag, I noticed they looked too large. They sent me size medium. They are much too large for me to wear. I am 5'6\", 97lbs, measurements are 22\" waist, 36\" hips. As other reviews mentioned, the button holes are much too small to actually get the buttons through, even when forced. I believe these new shorts are also a different brand than the previous ones, so I feel this is (in a way) an almost deceptive item to buy now. They are not really worth the time, money, or effort to send them back... Very disappointing. They are OK quality other than these issues. They have very cheap buttons as well, but they may hold up better due to the different brand. They look similar enough to the photo. I believe these are a hit or miss (likely the latter) product, so buyer be cautious of sizing issues and being sent the wrong product.", "summary": "Two stars", "unixReviewTime": 1503532800}

I love to carry them while shopping because I can hold my purse AND have my hands free.

After airing out, it became much less noticeable.  The leather is soft and supple, and the color is a true black.  It's a very nice square patchwork pattern.  It has a row of black paillettes across the front for decoration.\n\nSome of the stitch settings could be smaller- on the inside of the bag, for instance, on the lining, and also where the paillettes are sewn on, the stitch setting is a bit looser than I would expect from a leather item in this price range.  This could cause an inside pocket or decorative item to come off in time with a bit of wear and tear.\n\nOther than a few areas of less than optimal stitching, the bag looks great, and it holds items securely and is comfortable to wear.

Poza", "reviewText": "When I lived in Japan, this style of bag was very popular among young women in Tokyo. Various elements of the design made it ideal for a culture in which people spent a lot of their days on public transportation or walking. The size is ideal to give it enough capacity to carry everything you need for the day - like a large purse and it can be slung over your shoulder or carried on your back. While it will not accommodate a full-size laptop, it will fit a tablet easily as well as whatever necessities you might want to put in it. The snap closure makes it easy to open and close and you can moderate the opening size using the drawstring at the top. The straps are easy to adjust and hold firm once you set them to the size that you'd like.\n\nThe leather on this is very soft. The construction feels very good, but mine had a very minor stitching error on the top flap (the line was stopped and restarted adjacent - there was also an errant thread loop). This was nothing big, but it's worth mentioning. The only problem for me is that the decorative edging makes a gentle tinkling noise every time you move the bag or walk with it. It's not super loud, but it can be distracting. This may be best used for someone who either doesn't mind the sound or who isn't walking a lot of the time.\n\nThis is a very attractive and nicely functional backpack which serves as an excellent large-size handbag as well as a backpack.\n\nNote: I received this product in exchange for my assessment.", "summary": "soft leather and a great design", "unixReviewTime": 1429920000}

This is a really nice-looking bag, with a cool patchwork look. It's also comfortable to wear. As far as using it as a school backpack, that's not appropriate. It says it can fit a notebook, but I didn't find that to be true. The only way you can get away with a standard 8.5\" x 11\" spiral notebook is if you leave the drawstring on top totally open, which looks weird and doesn't protect the notebook. As you can see from the product photo, it's meant to cinch in on top, which makes the top three inches or so too narrow for a notebook.\n\nWhat it IS appropriate for is a tablet, and/or regular pocketbook contents-- wallet, sunglasses, brush/comb, water bottle, etc. Could also be a good plane carry-on if you just need a few things. What I see it as perfect for are the outings I take with my daughter to the zoo, park, etc... I don't have to worry about carrying an extra bag that I'd need to put down every time I want to take a picture of her or do something active.\n\nIt has a strong scent; I'm hoping it will air out after I've had it longer.

I am usually a medium skirt if the skirt is tight throughout; if it's a skater dress or skirt where it only needs to be tight at the waist, I'm usually a small or a 4. So since the reviews said it ran small, I ordered a Medium and it's perfect. The material feels pretty good; it looks exactly like the picture.  It got 4 stars instead of 5 from me because it's not super great quality-- in the back there's a crooked seem that comes out and is a bit noticeable (I found it when I was ironing).  However, I think any shirt I wear with it will cover the weird seam, so it's not a big deal.  You will need to iron or steam this skirt though as the material came very wrinkled. It is lined to about 2/3 the length of the skirt. Here's a couple pictures of it when I first took it out of the box and tried it on (before ironing).

I ordered this infant aviator hat and the bumble bee infant knit and they seemed great at first glance. But after looking back at my order I started noticing little things that bugged me. We're getting ready for our newest addition to the family this August 2016 and being in the airline industry we want to have some cool aviation related pictures taken of our baby girl once she arrives. A few days after receiving this item it kept bugging me that I'd seen these knits elsewhere and then my wife chimed in and said \"yeah, they're on Etsy\".\n\nThe seller of these knits looks like they purchased a template that's for sale by another seller on that site and borrowed some of the pictures. The knit helmet runs a little big for an infant, although done very well as far as being soft and complete, the design doesn't quite match up with what you see in the images. One thing I liked was that the goggles looked deep due to the layering of the stitching between the red and grey rim for the goggles, but what I actually received looked less recreation and more cartoon like. If you look at the picture you'll notice the inner goggle is much smaller than what you expect to receive, which makes it look bug eyed. Like some other reviewers noted, it's just not what's pictured.\n\nFor $7.00 I can't really complain, but those infant pictures are a one in a lifetime opportunity to get just the right image, and I don't want to be staring at a picture thinking how I should've just ordered the right one.

Within two weeks of getting it, I've worn it three times and washed it twice and it's just as wonderful as when I got it.

Pacheco", "reviewText": "The reviews on here are accurate.\nThis wallet is good enough but is seriously under-engineered and awkward. I bought the bigger one, it is an original and not a fake. This wallet is poorly designed and cannot hold too much of anything without quickly reaching its capacity. I had to omit several cards and photos because the wallet could not hold them.\nThe clasp that holds the wallet closed is extremely fragile and will bend if the wallet is closed on a bill or coin. Kind of understandable considering that the clasp is very thin metal, but still. If you do not deliberately watch the mechanism as you close it, this could happen to you. And even then, the clasp itself, tasked with holding all your valuables together, is woefully frail.\nErgonomically speaking the compartments need to be switched so that the credit cards are on one side and the bill storage is on the other. If you put more than 5 bills into the compartment, it won't close because the cc holder gets in the way.\nThey seem like a good company though and offered to replace my wallet when I informed them of the clasp issue (which I fixed myself). Decided that I will get another wallet when this one fails again (which it will, I am afraid).", "summary": "Cool wallet but fragile", "unixReviewTime": 1479168000}

When it came in, he was so excited that he put it on himself and wore it around with just a t-shirt. His little fingers were able to manipulate the clasp himself to undo and then again to clasp. I could appreciate that as I know sometimes it's a battle to get him dressed while also trying to get his baby brother and myself ready to get out the door when we have someplace to be. The ease of use means he can at least put it on himself, then if need be, I can tighten and put under his collar while I get him in or out of the car.\nWhat I really like about this is that it IS NOT a clip on tie. Clip on ties tend to have a cheap plastic clip or a tough metal one that is a bear to get open. They then seem to weigh some collars down. That wasn't the case with this tie. This was lightweight but still had quality fabric and construction. I like that it has the wrap around fabric too, to complete the look and appear as if we have it together and managed to knot a full out tie on a busy preschooler.\nThe colors are true to the images in the listing. What I didn't notice before buying was that there is a small image of a plane at the end of the tie. I though this was a very nice and classy touch along with the orange inner lining of the tie that can be seen peeking out of the back of the face of the tie (wherre the tag is). My son immediately picked up on the little plane and pointed it out to anyone and everyone that commented on his tie. Admittedly, when we opened the package, he put it on and wore it with his t-shirt. Although not the fashion choice I would have made, the color in his shirt matched the tie so kudos to him. We let him wear it to the grocery store and running other errands. I couldn't believe how many folks noticed and complimented him and us on the tie. No fewer than a half dozen folks had pleasantries to give regarding this tie.\nMy husband and I were actually so impressed that we think we may pick up a few other in the other avilable colorways. Our son actually enjoys wearing the tie, and conveniently he loves his polo shirts the best...so he'll be one dapper little man heading back to preschool this fall.\n\n**We recieved this tie at a discounted price in exchange for our honest feedback and review. No other compensation was received and all thoughts and opinions expressed in this review are our own.**", "summary": "For The Little Man", "unixReviewTime": 1439251200}

Clip on ties come apart when grabby hands pull on them, and it is hard to center them on the dress shirt.  This, with the clip in the back, looks great and stays in place.

The necklace itself is rather delicate in my opinion with its lace cutouts, chains and pendants. It also quite literally is a choker; as I must admit that the necklace is rather snug. When my item arrived; I must admit that I was beyond ecstatic, for me the shipping was not prime available and had a good couple of weeks wait time; which was perfectly fine. Considering it arrived two weeks ahead of schedule, I couldn't have been happier.\nWhen I opened the package I found the necklace hanging/wrapped up around a piece of cardboard that showed it off wonderfully. At first glance there seems to be an extension chain hooked to a little hole at the bottom corner of the cardboard which couldn't have made me happier because I was worried about the necklace being too tight. Once I unwrapped the item, it became clear that there was no chain on the necklace itself to allow you to wear it as depicted in the item photos. What I thought was an extension chain turned out to be part of the necklace itself--unattached.\nOn closer inspection it also seemed that the chain was just clipped onto the cardboard because the connecting end was tightly closed, and the item was seemed highly protected in the package it came in; so any chance it was a shipping issue seems unlikely. Upon finding this issue I contacted the seller who was cordial enough to email me attachment instructions. To be honest, the attachment is straightforward and exactly what I expected it to be prior to a response. All that really needs to be done is twisting open the connecting chain just enough to slide it through the hook on the necklace, then closing it back up. Because I have strength issues in my hands, I required a pair of \"needle pliers\" to get the connecting chain closed again. To be safe I also clamped it with said pliers as tight as I could.\nThe necklace is to me, a bit on the delicate side so I use caution when handling it and the few times I've worn it (with absolutely no problems by the way). Because of this I also do not just let it hang from a necklace stand; instead I keep it pinned flat, or laying flat, or wrapped around the neck of the cardboard piece it came it so that the chains do not get tangled up or rip off. It is a rather stunning artsy piece to have especially considering just how hard it is to find such pieces.\n\nI received this item at discount in return for my honest and unbiased review of the product.", "summary": "Fits many occasions.", "unixReviewTime": 1448841600}
