I really like that this 3 pockets have their own isolated compartment, and don't lead into a secondary pocket. The first one is a small zipper pocket which would hold some small items. I think this zippered pouch would be great for holding a cell phone, and having easy quick access to it. Then there is another zippered pocket, which is slightly bigger, and could hold any miscellaneous items such as calculate, pens, pencils, etc. There is a third, larger compartment that is separate and independent of the first two. Once you open the large, main zippered compartment, it expands to hold books, notebooks, and any school related item. On the inside, there is also a separated, thicker pocket, where you could place a laptop or tablet. It is a padded sleeve, so it would protect your laptop or tablet from the books inside. I really like how expansive this backpack, and it really seems to have many uses (not just for school).

And one last pouch in the front for holding your phone and other personal belongings.\n\nThe backpack fits my 17 inch laptop which is quite hefty, and it holds up very well. Inside the backpack there are little pockets for organization, so you can put pencils inside the pocket, kind of like a pencil pouch. There really is a lot of room and space for you to put things. I don't think my son has that many school supplies to even use all of the space. It's a great backpack for me to use personally, but even then I don't fill all of the compartments up. In the biggest zipper compartment there is a pocket designed for your laptop, which I like a lot because it keeps my laptop very secure in the backpack when I move around.\n\nThe design is nice, it looks very geometrical and sciencey. I feel it is a good unisex backpack for boys and girls. I think that the backpack would be great for college students who have a lot books, binders, and a laptop to hold.

My daughter has a tendency to carry half the house in her backpack, so in order for a backpack to not fall apart it has to be well-made and it needs to hold quite a bit as well.\n\nThis backpack is fantastic.  I was really surprised at how large this bag actually is.  I don't think the product pictures fully show how much will actually fit in this bag.  It has one main large compartment, with a separate pouch for a laptop or tablet.  It has padding to keep your laptop protected as well.\n\nThere are several additional pockets on the exterior of the backpack.  This leaves plenty of room for everything you need, and its also a lot easier to stay organized. She can keep all of her pens and pencils in a separate pouch and they won't end up broken in the bottom of her backpack.  The small zippered pouch is the perfect size for her phone or Ipod too.\nThis backpack is made of a durable, canvas type material, so its going to hold up very well over time.  The colors, oh the colors. This backpack really is as vibrant and pretty in person as in the product pictures.  My daughter absolutely loves the design and the colors.  Overall, Im extremely pleased with this bag and the Cougera brand.\n\nI received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.", "summary": "Fantastic Backpack!

I am not a purse person but I've found myself taking it everywhere even if there's barely anything in it. It is smaller than I expected (the Amazon dimensions are slightly off - the dimensions in the description from the company are more accurate). My dimension are approximate but it's about 13 inches wide at the bottom, 11 inches wide at the top where it opens, 10 inches tall, 3 inches wide at the bottom and 2 inches wide at the top. I thought I could fit my MacBook Air in it based on the Amazon dimensions but the opening is not wide enough for it. However, it does fit plenty of stuff plus has big and small pockets to keep everything organized. The small front pockets are good for a Cliff bar, my keys, and lip gloss. The big front pocket can easily fit a Kindle. The back pocket is about the same size as the front. There's also an inside zipped pocket that can hold receipts, travel itineraries, and a small notebook. Opposite this pocket, there are two large open pockets that can hold a passport and five credit card pockets that can hold 3 or 4 cards in each one.\n\nThe only section that \"locks\" is the main compartment. There is a latch to lock the zipper on. It's pretty easy to lock and unlock. The zipper doesn't slide very smoothly so it can take some maneuvering which is a downside but not a huge hassle. There is also a flashlight and latch on the inside of the bag. The latch is great for hooking on a set of keys. I realized if I really need a second section that \"locks\", I can easily latch this hook onto the back zippered section. The little ribbon on it is long enough to do so. Granted, you can cut this ribbon easily with scissors but would still slow someone down if they are trying to get in that pocket.\n\nThe strap doesn't completely detach. Just one side of it is removable. The length of it can easily be adjusted and it ranges from about 28 to 50 inches in length. It has a locking mechanism on the side that detaches. It takes just a second to unlock this from the bag once you know how it unlatches. Seems somewhat easy for a thief to remove this part if they are familiar with this bag but otherwise it wouldn't be very easy. It took me some time to figure out how it worked so there's enough of a delay there to throw someone off. I also like that this strap can be looped around something then reattached. You can easily loop the strap around a chair or subway pole and then relatch it to help prevent someone from running off with it.\n\nThe wristlet is an added bonus. It fits the smaller iPhone 6, some cash, and a slim set of keys. There's a strap on it that can be detached or you can hook it on to something for added security when traveling.\n\nOther than being a little small, it's a great buy with lots of cool features and some style to it as well!", "summary": "Great features, fits lots of stuff, and plenty of pockets!", "unixReviewTime": 1454716800}

Me, I'm more of a shine gal myself.  But I thought maybe the Fenical Hooded Camouflage Raincoat/Poncho could help make those rainy days less gloomy.  Here's my two cents so far.\n\n-Awesome color: I'm not sure this will really hide me in the woods, but this so cute I want to be noticed!\n-Waterproof tested: Since we're having a drought, I tested this out with my lawn sprinkler (my neighbors must think I'm nuts).  My shoes got wet, but not my clothes.\n-Decent fit:  I'm over 6 feet tall, so this only came to about my knees.  But that's still tons longer than my current raincoat.  The width seems like it could accommodate a wide range of folks.\n-Interesting material: I have no idea what PU plaid with taffeta treatment is.  I can say it is much better than the cheap, throw-away plastic poncho I have.  Water really beads up well on this (see picture below) and then just rolls off.\n-Multiple uses: I like that I could unsnap the sides of this and flatten it out for other uses, especially given the grommet corners.  I had been thinking about using it to line the bed of my SUV when hauling stuff to the dump, but this is just too pretty for that.  When you are done using, this comes with a matching storage bag too.\n-Keeping it real: I got hot after wearing this for a few minutes (didn't seem the most breathable).  In fairness, it was 80 plus degrees out, so getting sweaty was probably inevitable.\n\nI was thrilled to receive this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review, and I hope this is a helpful one too.  I take this seriously, since just like you, I look at reviews so I can made informed purchases.  My bottom line: the Fenical Hooded Camouflage Raincoat/Poncho is even cuter in person, and fought my sprinkler off like a champ.

The second thing I noticed was the lovely design of the bag. Small, compact, versatile, it may be used as either a crossover or shoulder bag, as the strap is adjustable. The metal hardware is tasteful, attractive, and appears to be durable. This bag is a perfect travel companion.\n\nThis bag is evenly and sturdily stitched and has a saffiano finish that will help make it resistant to scratches, as well as more durable and easy to clean. The interior of the bag is fully lined and has a pocket sleeve  that can accommodate one's smartphone or smartphone accessories. The interior also has five credit card sized sleeves that can accommodate identification and credit cards. There is an interior zippered compartment that is perfect for small items. This interior zipper is expertly set and zips open and shut easily. There is also a small key ring on the outside of this interior zippered compartment to which one may attach one's keys, which is a nice touch. The interior of the bag is relatively spacious for a small, compact bag.\n\nThe exterior of the bag has a slip in pouch on the front and back of the bag. Each pouch is suitable for carrying a paperback book or even a smartphone for easy access. My Kindle, when inserted vertically, fits quite nicely in either of these pouches, though for security purposes, I prefer using the back pouch for this purpose.\n\nThe Achilles heel in this bag, which I received from the seller in exchange for an impartial review, is the exterior zipper to the main compartment. Although it zips open and shut all the way, it is not done without a struggle, as the zipper seems to get stuck at various points. I can understand the complaints that others have had with this bag in regard this zipper breaking. Upon close examination of the bag, it is easy to see why. The zipper is clumsily set. It is not evenly set in the bag, with more grosgrain of the zipper backing showing at different intervals than others. So, it fails in its execution.\n\nThis is strictly a quality control issue. Once a zipper is unevenly set, as it is with this bag, the zipper will get stuck and, ultimately, break. The seller needs to ensure that the zipper backing be inset and sewn into the bag evenly, so that the entire zipper is at all points equidistant from the edge of the bag. Once the zipper is evenly inset  into the bag, the zipper will open and shut evenly. Were it not for this quality control issue,  This would be a five star bag.", "summary": "A GORGEOUS BAG WITH QUALITY CONTROL ISSUES...", "unixReviewTime": 1466380800}

It looks just like the picture, honestly, and that's so rare. It's also quite flattering despite not being fitted through the waist. Also, the lace across the top obscures enough for most ladies to wear this without a bra (assuming that's comfortable for them). The one drawback is that the lace is only in front so if you do choose to wear a bra it will show in the back. I will probably wear this with a tank underneath just because I'm not very comfortable without a bra.\n\nAll in all its a very sexy top yet also manages to seem demure because of the high neck and Victorian vibe. I'm 5'2\" 160 pounds with a C chest and the Medium fit me very well (a bit tight in the shoulders but I have broad shoulders and its stretchy so it's all good). I will say that it's a bit short. It barely covers my waistband and I have a short torso. I imagine someone of a normal height might end up showing an inch or two of belly. If that isn't appealing it still looks great over a tank top.\n\nEDIT: I ended up returning this top. It's still awesome but the first time I went to actually wear it out (not just try it on) I noticed a kind of black mark on the front... It was hidden within the folds, maybe something from packing? Anyway, just check all the folds of the fabric before you wear it, this was probably a one-off but still.

The \"elastic\" of the waistband is not really that stretchy, and I would say that the true flat measurement is much closer to the \"B\" measurement of the size chart.\n\nAfter returning the XL, I ordered a L, and I am much happier with the fit of this size for me! It sits comfortably at my waist without slipping down or being too tight, and the thick fabric of the skirt itself is very comfortable and has the swing I was looking for.

I don't wear bikinis, and its hard to find swimsuits that fit well.\nFit\nIm 510, 145 pounds, and a 32D. I usually wear a 6, and ordered the 4/6 large. It fits, but its a tiny bit tight in the bum and across the back (where there is elastic). The top fits well and Im not falling out all over the place though, which is great!\nThe space between the cups on top and bikini lining is about eight inches. Some other reviewers have mentioned that they have tried it on and its bunched up in the torso, so I figured Id take a picture of just how much distance there is. (To see if that works for you, measure from the bottom of your bra to your hip bone)  It is not super full coverage in the bottom. (Please excuse how pasty I am!) In the picture I have included measuring the length of the bust to waist, you can see how there isn't a lot of difference between the seat of the suit and the crotch (front).\nConstruction/fabric\nIts well constructed, there aren't any loose seams. The lining fabric is a little bit thin. You cant see anything because there is another layer over it, but after seeing how thin the fabric is, I am glad I got the navy instead of the white.\nThe bottom lining is sewn down completely, so you don't have to worry about it shifting, and the cups are well padded.\nOne thing to remember is that because it is a crochet style swimsuit it needs even more gentle care than a normal suit because it can snag on things. Normal swimsuits shouldnt be washed in the washer so they last longer, this I would even be really careful washing by hand in some sinks.\nI received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest review.", "summary": "So pretty!", "unixReviewTime": 1457654400}

I am constantly wearing necklaces, I typically just choose a pendant and just keep it on for a week. I have been looking for ones with some color and flower looking ones and when I came across this one, I thought this might be really nice for work and everyday wear. It is pretty and simple, but very nice. It was a good price, so I figured, why not?\n\nThis necklace came in a nice beautiful box. The pendant itself was smaller than I thought it would be, but it is beautiful. I like how it looks and it impressed me. I do want say this though that while part of this is sterling silver, I believe the rest of it is not. I mean it won't fade and give anyone a rash or anything, but the sterling alive 925 stamp isn't on the pendant itself but just on the part where it hangs off the necklace. Either way, it is still a very nice piece. The necklace chain itself is sterling though, I believe.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this for anyone looking for an inexpensive, fun piece to wear to work or for causal purposes. It is nice and looks great!\n\nDisclaimer: I received this product at a discount or free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Smaller than I thought, but still a good size; may not be fully 925.", "unixReviewTime": 1463875200}

When I saw the pendant on-line, I was a bit underwhelmed by the photos, but I decided to take a chance on it, anyway.  Im very glad I did!  The necklace arrived in a stunning gift box.  The case has a velvety burgundy-colored octagonal box, with a dark rose colored ribbed ribbon trim around the sides that is made into a box on the top of the box.  The necklace is attached to a card covered with the velvety material.  I will keep this box in my personal collection because it is so special.  If you're looking for a necklace that would make a good presentation as a gift, this one will fit the bill nicely.\n\nThe necklace chain is extremely eye-catching.  The twisted chain design catches the light as you move and makes the silver sparkle and shine.  The pendant is a little bigger than my thumb nail.  Since you don't know how big my thumbnail is, Ive provided a photo with the pendant next to a dime.  It is well-designed, and it is a quality piece of jewelry, not just another piece of costume jewelry.\n\nIn summary, I love this necklace, and Im glad to have it in my jewelry collection.\n\nDo I recommend the product?  Yes, absolutely!\nWould I buy the product again?  Yes.\nWould I be willing to pay full price in the future?  Yes.\n\nDisclosure:  I received this product at discount, in exchange for offering an honest review.  I am not affiliated with the products company in any way, and hope you find this review helpful.

The red color and the design is what drew me to it.  It is a show stopper.\n\nWhen I opened the box I was struck by the beautiful presentation.  The scarf is in a lovely red box.  Inside theres an added surprise of a Chinese Knot and a gift box for it.  Ive used these before to hang off dresser pulls, doors and you can even put them on a Christmas tree.  Many uses for them.  The scarf is wrapped in tissue.  Also included is a pretty red gift bag.\n\nThe scarf is 100% silk and is very soft and supple.  I loved the feel of it.  It is super long.  I can wrap this several times around my neck.  A brochure is enclosed to show you different ways to wear the scarf.  It is also unisex so men and women can wear it.\n\nInstructions say to dry clean or wash by hand.  Use a medium temperature iron.  As far as I can tell it looks well made.\n\nThis is a beautiful accessory that youd be proud to wear out to dinner, to the theater or any event. FYI:  In my photo I didn't try to style the scarf.  I wanted to let you see the beautiful design and length.\n\nI received this free for my unbiased and honest opinion.\n\nFYI:  Modern Usage of Artistic Knots\n\nAlong with being symbolic gifts or messages, knots are still used if they wear traditional Chinese clothing or as good luck charms. They are a means of fastening traditional garments instead of buttons or wooden pegs. Now, silk is most widely used to make these clothing knots.\nThey are used as jewelry such as even rings, earrings, bracelets, and necklaces. They are sold as handicraft novelty items too.\n\nhttp://www.chinahighlights.com/travelguide/culture/knot.htm", "summary": "Showstopper!", "unixReviewTime": 1452470400}

Makes it very comfortable to wear\n The stone, while not real diamond, does not come off as costume. Its not as clear as an actual diamond but does give off some shine. It is a nice size, about the diameter or a pencil eraser.\n The stand is really attached to the ring, I don't expect to see it coming off anytime soon\n The ring is petite, not at all garish. It is extremely comfortable to wear. Ive slept in it with no issues, no marks on my fingers, no marks on my face, no scratches and the ring did not bend or lose any pieces (stones etc.)\n\nI've received tons of compliments; the ring is a totally unique design as well.

At first, I was concerned this might affect the comfort, but it doesn't. At first glance, one can't even tell it's adjustable. You have to give the ring a good look to see that it's adjustable.

I am a silver lover, definitely prefer it over  gold.

Makes it very comfortable to wear\n The stone, while not real diamond, does not come off as costume. Its not as clear as an actual diamond but does give off some shine. It is a nice size, about the diameter or a pencil eraser.\n The stand is really attached to the ring, I don't expect to see it coming off anytime soon\n The petals of this ring are darling, and the ring is petite, not at all garish. It is extremely comfortable to wear. Ive slept in it with no issues, no marks on my fingers, no marks on my face, no scratches and the ring did not bend or lose any pieces (stones etc. )\n\nFor those who are more bohemian  this ring actually really works as an engagement or promise ring.

I can see it tarnishing as time goes by, but it's a very girly clutch that is surprisingly not too girly. I was afraid it'll be too sparkly, but despite it being even more sparkly than the pictures, it's not too much. It also isn't too rough on the outside, it's like a fine crystal mesh laid over the hard case so it has slightly movement, catches the light but won't catch delicate fabrics. The clasp folds all the way over the side of the purse so it feels secure.\nIt comes with 2 straps, one that's meant for the arm and another that's a cross body length, and a small bag of replacement crystals.\nIt fit an iPhone 8 with the most basic case, but just barely. Anything larger would not fit. I could also fit a credit card, a small lip thing, some cash and my ID and hotel key card in a small cloth pouch with the phone. That's all it would fit.\nI just don't think I'll keep it because I don't have that many events to used a sparkly clutch and it'll tarnish by the time the next event rolls around. Also, a crystal fell off while I was inspecting it out of the packaging but I couldn't figure out where it fell off.

I will commence with the positive followed by the negative.\nOverall the sizing for the body portion was amazing. It fits around my midsection and is actually long enough. Items like this have a tendency of running short for me so I was pleasantly surprised. The lace appears to be a respectable quality, there are no loose strings visible, it had a nice stretch to it and the shiny gold thread is well done. I like that the straps tie around your neck so it would be easily adjustable.\nI have two negative things to say about the product, and to me they are large subjects.\nThe foremost being, there were no product tags attached. This makes the item feel used to me and I am not comfortable with that. The tags weren't even included in the package. I found this extremely odd considering the item photos clearly show tags. The second issue I have is the fit of the top. The photos have a rather busty woman modeling the top therefor I was convinced about the fit while purchasing. I am a large C cup and this didn't even come up to my nipples. I measured and the lace portion of the top is 4 inches tall. I would highly recommend you measure your body or bra to insure this will fit your chest. There is no way I could wear this item if I wanted it to cover my breasts even a little.\nMy overall opinion is that it would be a wonderful purchase for a smaller busted individual or someone who measures and is happy with where it will sit on their body. For me, the bottom of my nipples and feeling the item as used just wasn't cutting it.

It feels good on your skin. The stitching is done in a cared for manner and the execution of the lace overlay on the sleeves deserves and A+.  The lace itself really isn't lace as I know it.  When I think of lace, I think of a delicate fabric and this is not.  It's going to stand up through time, washer and dryer cycles. It's also soft, like the fabric and much thicker than you'd expect from lace.  It is a bit longer on me than the picture reflects.  It comes to the mid section of my thigh.  I can easily wear with tights, leggings, skirts anything. I have purchased three shirts in this style.  Two from Finejo and one from another.  The difference is as vast and dry as the desert.  The other seller's product was haphazardly sewn, fabric beneath lace was removed (rather than an overlay) and the sleeves were dripping with threads when it arrived and fell apart post haste. I recommend this product from this seller.", "summary": "Great Item - Buy here only", "unixReviewTime": 1487462400}

When I received it I ripped it open immediately and had to try it on. At first I didn't love it like I thought I would but after a looking at it a few minutes I fell in love! It was very different from a regular bikini swimsuit I was use to but I'm so glad I decided to step out of my box and get this swimsuit. The colors in person are just as beautiful and bright as in the stock photo and the quality is amazing. It also comes with a little card thanking you for your purchase, which I found to be that little extra oomph for the seller to keep me as a customer. The bottoms are scrunched so it's easy to hide and extra belly fat you may be wanting to hide. I will say that I found the very top of the bottoms to be a little small but I am a naturally small person anyways so I will not drop a star due to my body type being smaller than most. I highly recommend this swimsuit, especially if you've been considering a retro swimsuit! The price and quality are unmatchable!

I also really like the height of the sock, not too low or high, so it works fine with wearing pants.  Given how well it molds to my foot/ankle, it also doesn't shift while wearing.  It's a pretty perfect sock.\n\nI'm so thoroughly impressed with the great customer service of this fine American company.

They are flattering, and I love the design. You can see from the pics that they are mesh on the front of the leg below the knee, on the back, and a bit up the outer thigh. The other fabric is a spandex/lycra, with a bit of sheen. The leggings are not thick, but not see through, either, so they're perfect to wear for a long workout or even on a warmer day when you don't feel like wearing capris or shorts. They are high waisted, which is nice, and the waistband is wide so it does not twist or fold. My only problem with these is that they are quite large! I am 5'8\" 130lbs so I usually fit between a S and a M. I figured I would size up just in case on these, that that was the wrong decision. I definitely should have ordered a S or maybe even XS. As you can see from the pics they are not super form fitting, but they still look cute.\n\nPROS\ngreat design, good material, nice high waist\n\nCONS\nway too big! order at least a size down\n\n*I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review", "summary": "Cute leggings - order a size smaller!", "unixReviewTime": 1459555200}

It's very thin, but stretchy - no idea if I'd say it's cotton, but it's like a thin tee shirt and will show every lump and bump if it's too tight on the person.  I live in South Florida, so it will be comfortable all year long. And that's the only reason it's ok for me.  Luckily I ordered the x-large because the reviews say it runs small.  I'm only 5 ft. tall with measurements of 37 Bust, 33 Waist, 41 Hips.  The x-large actually fits good, except for the sleeves which come to the bottom of my fingertips.  They are described as being 3/4 length sleeves, so the fit of the sleeve length is off,  However, the the upper part of the sleeve has a little elastic so that when my arms are bent, the sleeves can be pulled up a little.  But some people like having long sleeves.  Just don't expect them to be 3/4 unless you're a tall person.  As for the length of the entire garment, it covers my bottom and will be ok with either leggings or regular pants.  I'm somewhat disappointed that the color is actually more of a soft green than bluish aqua.", "summary": "Wish the material wasn't so thin.", "unixReviewTime": 1509235200}

Reviews on some other Roots of Fight shirts say to get a size larger than what you typically need but I don't think you need to do that with this particular shirt.\n\nI typically wear a size large in graphic t-shirts, so I bought a size large in this and it fits like a large shirt. However I like a bit of room in my shirts so if you want your shirt to fit more snug I'd suggest buying a medium. The neck hole is slightly big on the large shirt that I bought. And by that I mean it is slightly looser around the neck than I would prefer, but overall the shirt fits pretty nicely.\n\nThe material feels fairly thin so I hope it holds up after multiple washes.

And even though I received a discount I will gladly buy more earrings from this seller because they have provided a beautiful product to me.\n\nI received this product at a discount in exchange for a review that is truthful and unbiased, which I have done.

Looks an awful lot like a popular Tag Heuer model. Wasn't expecting much. Got more than i expected.\n\nThe negatives first: There are 3 lies on the dial, and one truth. The 1st lie is \"Water Resistant 200 meters\". The fact is this watch isn't even a little bit water resistant. Water seeps in around the crystal and there are no rubber gaskets in the crown nor in the pry-off back. The 2nd lie is \"JAPAN MOVT\". The movement is Chinese (of course) and is marked as such.  The 3rd lie is that the hands have white paint on them. They are not luminous at all. The truth is in the name. You want a Soki watch, that is what you get, a sucky watch.\n\nNow here are the positives: This watch is really beautiful. The crystal appears to be glass and has a nice bevel around the edge. The Arabic numerals are raised and look as though they were either painted on or applied. The case is black and sturdy, with a protective notch for the crown. The 22mm strap is a leathery-looking synthetic material that stretches somewhat and is really comfortable, like a pair of crocs. Despite not being luminous, the white hands are easy to see in low light because of the contrast against the black dial. The watch disassembles easily, so even if you get some humidity inside the case, you can easily take it apart and dry it out. The movement, like most quartz movements, keeps time accurately. What more can you ask for from a cheap watch? It looks good and keeps time.", "summary": "Looks good and keeps time...", "unixReviewTime": 1460073600}

These are good for summer months and shoes that might be a bit snug, but I wouldn't use them when going to the gym as they wouldn't be very absorbent. My husband either requires socks for dress shoes or more absorbent socks for anytime he's wearing sneakers. That said like I mentioned the value is really good for 12 and it's always good to have extra socks!\n\nDisclaimer: Please note that I received this 12 pack of low cut no show ankle socks at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

When the package arrived and I gave him the socks to check out, he immediately didn't like them. He said they were way too thin and polyester, not cotton. He almost didn't try them at all. He took them home and texted me later that night telling me everything he said about the socks was wrong. He said they were incredibly comfortable (and he has size 13-14 feet), stretched great, and, although thin, protected his feet and, as promised, didn't show over his trainers.\n\nThe socks come 12 pairs to  a set for a very good retail price. They are made of 98% polyester and 2% Spandex. My son still would prefer cotton as they absorb perspiration better but these socks also seem to be fairly absorbent as well. They also don't shrink a lot when washed and dried. They aren't good for cold weather but fine for moderate to hot weather and for the gym anytime.\n\nThe one thing that would make them perfect is if they had some cotton for better absorption but, in all, these are very comfortable, well fitting socks and they are a good value as well.\n\nPlease note that I paid a discounted price for these socks in exchange for my evaluation and honest review. I not affiliated with the seller nor was I compensated in any way for my review. I am a real Amazon shopper who buys lots of things for full price and some for discounted ones. I base all my reviews on the same things - quality, value, personal experience, and preference.

I ordered another pair on July 5, 2016 and I loved them again, sure enough the new pair broke. I noticed it was missing a screw and fortunately I had the old pair laying around, so I took the screw I needed and used it to repair where the missing screw was.  The sunglasses broke again a week later.  These sunglasses have broken three times.  I contacted the seller and asked what they would offer to do since I purchased 2 pairs from them and they never responded so I decided to go ahead and post this review for anyone considering these sunglasses.

My boyfriend put his on first and asked if I was sure it was for guys. He wears about a size 13 ring and this was small, both in size and style. For him to wear it on his ring finger, the back of the ring had to be separated completely. I tried to pull mine to make it bigger but I couldn't budge it. He had to make it larger for me so I could wear it. I was about a size 8 on my ring finger and it works well. Sometimes it seems loose so I tighten it while it's on, but then have trouble taking it back off. The cubic Zirconia pieces are still in place. Those little pieces often fall off first. I wear mine on my ring finger mainly, my boyfriends taking to wearing his on his pinkie because he likes how it looks and almost finds it funny to have a ring there. Atleast for the Phoenix, the adjustable pieces slide together in the back so it's a smooth back, not like those ones from childhood that have two rough edges (like the color changer cheapo rings). I can't check the dragon because my boyfriend has it on and he isn't here but I would assume it's the same way.

They are buffed out and shiny, just like in the pictures. The lower areas, are more of a matte, or dull type of surface, which is good as it brings out the details of the ring much better. One thing that is misleading by the picture is the stone. On the picture, it shows the stone to be very clear, and shiny, where in person, it has more of a dull look to the stone. This was common for both rings, but more on the men's dragon, then then women's phoenix ring. The Woman's one, is a bit clearer then the men's.\n\nThis does have a Cubic Zirconia stone in it, as stated in the listing, but I have seen other Cubic Zirconia stones that were much clearer then these. So it is not because of the type of stone that they are not really shiny or clear. This is just a quality of a stone, or the cut of it, thing. This does in no way make it a poor ring, as you have to remember, these are not large stones, so it does not bring much attention to this fact when wearing it. The men's ring, with it being the largest of the stones, is only around an 1/8\" in diameter, maybe a hair more. Also, the way that the stone is set in the men's ring, is slightly off from the picture too., I have included a picture so you can see how mine looks with the setting of the stone.\n\nSince they are made out of silver, they are easy to bend too. If you look closely at the back of the band, you can see that these are made so that you can slide the band, or stretch it, by yourself, to make it the size that you need to fit you. This is good because you will not have to pay a jeweler to size the ring to fit you, which saves on cost. Just be careful not to over bend or kink it when adjusting it to the size that you need. after all, Like I said, it is made out of pure 925 silver, it is not just a coating of it, so it can bends somewhat easily,\n\nOn the sizing factor, it goes up to a pretty large size. I have larger hands. I wear an extra large in a men's glove, so that should tell you something about the size of my hands. And I had no problem with the dragon ring fitting my ring finger.\n\nThey came in a nice ring case too, not some kind of cheap bag or anything like that.\n\nOverall, they are very pretty rings and I am very happy with them.\n\nI did get these are a discount for giving a review. as for my rating, I dropped one star off, only because of the men's ring stone not being as clear as they show, or indicate that it is, in the listing. after all there is no clarity rating on them. The picture in the listing should be of the actual quality of the product that you get, where in this case, it pretty much is of everything but the stone. This does not make it a bad ring though, and it does not make me like it any less. You should just know what you are getting, and the picture here, is misleading. so -1 for that.\n\nalso, sorry for the pictures being a little out of focus, The glare from the rings was knocking the auto focus feature out of wack when trying to get the picture.", "summary": "Nice rings, slightly misleading picture.", "unixReviewTime": 1452556800}

I received my rings today. They were  properly packaged without any damages and described as per seller. They came in a beautiful little jewelry box. Positioned side by side. Beautiful presentation. These are quite neat. They are adjustable on the bottom of the rings. These rings you can slide the piece in and out per size needed. I wear a size 7 and my husband a size 11. I had no problems adjusting them for the sizes I needed. I retain water and I am also diabetic and my fingers often swell. These are great for me because of the ability to adjust. The womans ring has a beautiful heart with the word forever and the mens ring the shape is square and the word forever.  These can be used for any occasion. They can be used as an engagement ring, valentines or just a simple thinking of you. I also think they could  be used as a gift perhaps from mother to daughter. There are several possibilities and occasions these could be used. These rings are 925 sterling silver so I don't worry with my fingers turning green. This is a great metal and a good quality ring. This would be\n great for someone who doesn't have a lot to spend on a good quality ring or maybe your saving up for that one special ring. Remember this can indeed be adjusted and used on any finger. I am providing a few photos of the ring on my finger. The views are the top of the ring as well as the bottom where the piece slides in and out for adjusting.

The rings are a lovely matched set with the man's ring having a single solitaire stone and the woman's ring having a center stone surrounded by 6 smaller stones on each side of the solitaire.  The bands are adjustable as you can see if you look carefully at the back of the band in the picture.  The inside back of both rings just slides to a larger size, as needed.  I am sure you could take it to a jeweler and permanently set it to your correct size.  The rings are beautifully crafted and smooth polished to perfection.  I am enjoying the set of rings very much and my boyfriend loves his too.  I love the shape and flow of this ring and the nice modern look of the set.

Since the crystal is transparent it looks a little darker Blue toward the top and lighter Blue toward the wider bottom part. I love that effect. These drops are actually Swarovski Elements Pear shaped pendants. They are 22 X 13 mm. They have a hole at the top which is how they connect to the metal of the earring. This is a good design because that lets the crystal swing and move around.\n\nI like the medium length of these earrings. They are about 1.6 inches from top to bottom. I did not find them heavy at all and they are comfortable to wear. The ear hook in a straight line gives these earrings a clean and elegant look. I also like how they added those little clear crystals along the hook. Those add extra shine. These are easy to put on just by sliding into the ear. Since the back piece is long they stay on my ears and have not slipped out.\n\n*Tip: I recommend not pulling open these hooks and then pressing them tighter once you have them on your ears. Eventually that will weaken the metal along the top and they might break. Adjust the hook part to a comfortable width where you can put them on and where they won't be too open in the back once you have them on. Then just leave them like that.\n\nThe metal is Sterling Silver and I did find the 925 stamp on the back of the earring hook. They are also Rhodium Plated which helps keep the Silver from tarnishing and protects it. These came with a small silver polishing cloth and a Pink velvet pouch and a gift box. Also included is a little Swarovski Elements hang tag to prove authenticity.\n\nLove the design and they look beautiful. These are as described and I did not find any flaws. I highly recommend these earrings.\n\n*****DISCLOSURE: I received this item free of charge to evaluate and review.

After a day or two of sitting on a mannequin head on a shelf, I noticed it was starting to appear very frizzy and I could obviously not wear it that way. So I took up the tedious task of re-braiding. It is in slightly better condition than it was but still pretty frizzy and the end is still as brittle as it came. Also, it has the tendency to slip off my head, as it runs rather small...so needs to be pinned very well. I suppose as long as you are okay with it being frizzy, it is a good choice for you...I however needed it to dress up as Rapunzel to be a princess for kids' parties so it needed to be as authentic as possible. Hope this was helpful to those looking to purchase. Good luck!", "summary": "A bit frizzy", "unixReviewTime": 1517270400}

This store has a special card that accumulates points like so many stores have now. I have a small leather pouch that I keep my different cards in. I said to the gentleman that was helping me, let me get my card. He said no it's okay and asked for my little pouch. Knowing this person it didn't bother me to give him the whole pouch of cards. He took it, swiped the whole thing under the machine and it found and read the exact card he needed right through the stack of cards surrounding it. Like I said I was a bit surprised, but definitely not shocked. With all the technology increasing each and every day it wouldn't surprise me if in the near future a device is developed that will be able to bypass the RFID cases but in the meantime may as well take advantage of a case like this. I have heard before that some of RFID blocking cases actually only claim they work, when they don't. I wanted to get a chance to go to the store I mentioned and ask them to try one on their machine to see if these really do work. I don't have doubts in them, it's mostly to satisfy my curiosity. When I go back in there I plan on having them try. Until then, I will be assuming that they do. If they don't function as they should, I will come back and post an update. This set of cases contains six holders, each with a different design. They open and close very easily but not so easy that a case would fall open. The inside of these cases are all black and have eight slots for cards. You can add a few extra cards, if need be. These cases are durable and well made, I love all the different designs. I am very pleased with this purchase and as for the cost of this product you definitely can't go wrong in purchasing them. These days we need all the help we can get when it comes to protecting our personal information.\nI received this set of cases at a discounted price for my honest review. I assure you that every product I review, whether I pay full price or a reduced price will get an honest review.

According to the sizing chart listed in the product description, this should have fit, but unfortunately that was not the case.  This bathing suit was at best a size medium and I couldn't get it on at all, so I passed it on to my niece, who wears between a size small and a medium and it fit  her very well.  The quality of the overall bathing suit is great, so I only took off one star for the sizing issue.\n\nI do like the unique styling of the shoulders of this bathing suit.  The strings are easy to adjust to allow you to wear this bathing suit comfortably, and are open through the back (although they do create quite an interesting tan line).  The edges of the arm and leg holes of the bathing suit are nicely placed and don't dig while you are wearing the bathing suit.  There is enough material in the crotch area to completely cover everything that needs to be covered, and the neckline also comes up just high enough to cover what needs to be covered there, as well.  While there is a little stretch to the material of the bathing suit, there isn't very much; I think the material is tighter to create a slimmer line on your body.  There is no additional padding or underwire in the bra of the bathing suit.  The listing states to handwash and dry clean; I don't handwash anything, so we washed this in a cold cycle with our regular laundry and then hung it up to dry and didn't have any issues with shrinkage or wearing away of the material.  All of the elastic edging continues to hold firm after several washings.  All of the seams are securely stitched and I didn't notice any loose threads or unravelling seams.  I believe this bathing suit would definitely hold up through several seasons of wearing.\n\n**I received this bathing suit at a discount in exchange for product testing; the above review is a true reflection of my experience with this product and has not been influenced in any way.**", "summary": "Excellent quality bathing suit, but make sure you buy up a size.", "unixReviewTime": 1460332800}

We ordered five of these dresses for the bridesmaids in my daughter's wedding.  All of them are in college and on a very tight budget, so we \"took our chances\" ordering dresses from Amazon rather than a local bridal store.  Each woman customized her dress by submitting her measurements.  We coordinated all orders with the company so all dresses would be made at the same time with the same dye lot fabric.  Felaladress sent a color chart so we could pick our exact fabric color.  They combined all orders, confirmed everything before fabricating the dresses, and all dresses were made and in the mail within a few days.  We received them within a couple weeks from ordering...much quicker than Amazon's estimated delivery date.  All of our emails were promptly answered, often within minutes (during their business hours (America's evening and nighttime hours)).  The quality of these dresses is superb...excellent workmanship, great materials, attention to detail.  No shortcuts.  The bodice and all seams are expertly constructed, lace and beadwork sewn on securely, fantastic quality throughout.  Some of the dresses were too long, but otherwise the fit was very good.  We had a problem with a local seamstress who took up the hem on a couple dresses...they came back smelling like smoke, one had a spot on it, and one had the hem brought up too high.  It was heart breaking. Dry cleaning is very expensive, so I washed them in warm water on delicate in my front loading machine and hung them to dry, and they came out perfect...fresh and clean, as good as new.  The dresses withstood the washing well.  We had to reorder the one that was taken up too much.  Felaladress checked that they still had the same fabrics, confirmed all measurements with me again, and they had the dress in the mail the same day they received the order!  Recommend them and this dress HIGHLY. Be sure to customize your order..it is worth it and you will get exactly what you want.  Really one of the best values for our money that we have ever spent.", "summary": "Excellent Value!", "unixReviewTime": 1490659200}

I have attached several pictures, but they do not do it justice. Buying dresses online can be complicated, but I used the measuring tool provided and the dress fits pretty much as expected.

The back is corseted, so that makes the sizing a little more forgiving. The material is very soft, the beading is beautiful, and I love the neckline as well.\nWe ordered this dress for my daughter's senior prom. She is more hourglass shaped than I am, but the dress fits her as well as it does me. In the photos attached I have used a tape measure to show the waist, bust, and length measurements. I am standing on the first step of the staircase, so that you can see the entire dress. As you can tell, it is very long. To me, the dress is so beautiful I don't think the additional length warrants taking off a star. As with any formal dress you expect to need alterations. Because of the corseted back the only alteration that will need made is for the length. It fit my daughter and I both despite having completely different body types; we just had to lace the back differently. Overall, I am very pleased with this dress.

To me, this watch looks dramatically more expensive than it costs, has a large but not-too-large, easy-to-read dial and an elegant metal band that fit my arm perfectly without adjustment.  This watch comes with a link removal tool for those whose arms are smaller.\n\nMy past experience with watches that have self-winding, spring-wound movements has been that they have not been as accurate as quartz-regulated, battery powered watches.  This watch has delighted me with its accuracy.  I've been wearing this watch and comparing its accuracy with atomic clock time, and have observed that it has been gaining an average of slightly less than one second a day.  Though still not as accurate as most quartz watches, I found the time-keeping capabilities of this watch to be surprisingly good and certainly good enough for my needs.  I'm more than willing to sacrifice this small difference in accuracy for the handsome appearance of this watch.\n\nPeeking through the transparent window on the back of this watch's case enables me to see the precision movement of this watch in action.  It's a beautiful example of fine workmanship.  For anyone who seeks an expensive watch appearance at a very reasonable price, I can enthusiastically recommend this one, which I received in exchange for an honest evaluation and review.", "summary": "Accurate and Beautiful Inside and Outside", "unixReviewTime": 1456444800}

It is so pretty and unique. Not only is it a great Mother's Day gift it is great for saying \"I love you mom\" any time of the year. The inside of the locket says Best Mom in Purple color letters. The back is engraved with the phrase \"I love you\". This charm is also a floating charm locket. It opens up. The two sides are kept closed with a pair of magnets on both sides. It makes a pretty secure hold so the little charms inside don't fall out. This comes with 4 little flower shaped floating charms. You can always add more or replace them with different charms. I love all the little cute details on this. All around the front are tiny little shiny Cubic Zirconia crystals. They make this so shiny and sparkly. Hanging from the top is also a little cute heart charm. It has three tiny Purple crystals in the middle. This is a good medium size for a bracelet charm. About 15 X 15 mm in size.\n\nThe back of the charm is stamped S925 so it is Sterling Silver which I love. All the loops on top are soldered closed. That makes me feel more secure that it won't easily get lost. The charm fit easily onto my Pandora style bracelet. This charm is not very heavy but it does have some weight to it. I found it comfortable to wear but it does tend to hang toward the bottom of the bracelet because of the weight. You can even put this charm on a necklace instead of a bracelet if you would prefer because the loop on top is nice and wide.\n\nI love this charm. It says it is a limited edition so I am very happy I got it before it is gone. Very pretty for a special mom. It comes in a nice gift box and a small polishing /cleaning cloth included.\n\n*****DISCLOSURE: I received this item free of charge. This is my honest unbiased review.

I sized up for both and ordered larges because I knew they ran small. I'm 5'5\" and I don't think either would be flattering for anyone who is much taller. There isn't much room lengthwise in the crotch/butt area.\n\nThis one has a nude lining whereas Choies has a stark white lining. The lace is pleated under the bust like the picture whereas Choies is not.  In addition Choies is double lined in the chest area so you have the option of wearing without a bra whereas this one is not double lined. The one from Choies is significantly higher quality and made SO better. In comparison to Choies, this was sewn a lot sloppier, the fabric quality was poorer and thinner, and overall just does not seem like it will hold up as well. The end of the one strap was not sewn closed and was fraying along with another portion of the strap. The zipper is in the middle of the back whereas Choies has theirs on the side, but that doesn't make any difference in terms of wearability. However, you can see how much sloppier the zipper was put in compared to Choies. Also there's a lot more loose thread on this one, like on the sides where the lace was serged together.\n\nLike another reviewer mentioned, the right hemline is longer than the left and for me, it was more than two inches longer. This is the biggest reason why I am returning this. Perhaps, not all of them are like that but I cannot keep and wear something this lopsided and uneven. I give this item two stars because it seems unwearable and doesn't seem like it would last, even if it was wearable.

The black stones (onyx) are a matte finish rather than polished which I prefer.  However I did fear that the matte finish would be more susceptible to surface scratches or that it might show more wear, but after wearing it daily for a while I haven't noticed that to be a legitimate concern as there are zero scratches on any of the stones.  The blue stone in my bracelet has more color variation than the one in the photos, which is to be expected (because they are natural stones no two will be alike).  My stone is somewhat translucent and I can see the center \"cord\" inside the stone when viewed at certain angles, while from other angles it is more cloudy and the cord isn't visible.  Personally I prefer the color variation of my stone so I'm glad this isn't just a solid manmade piece of glass.\n\nI have smaller wrists so I was concerned this might be too big for me, but I'm happy to report the sizing is just right.  It is a little loose on my wrist just the way I would want it, but for someone with larger wrists this particular size might be too tight.  For even smaller wrists it would be possible to remove a stone if you were comfortable with cutting and re-tying the center cord but I haven't found the need to do so.  Either way I'd recommend measuring your wrist to ensure this will provide the proper fit.  The other aspect to note is the size of the stones.  They are a bit larger than some of the other options (10mm) each.  I feel like this is the right size for my wrist/hands and it is more of a bulky look than the smaller beads, so although I do agree this might be more of a traditional \"men's\" size or style, I also feel it would look great on a woman also.  Thus I'd consider this more of a unisex style rather than one just for guys.\n\nJust to note, the center elastic cord is a brown color.  So it really isn't' visible between any of the stones as it blends in, but as I mentioned previously I can see it through the blue stone at certain angles.  Had they used a white cord I suppose it would be less visible through the blue stone, but then I fear I might see little glimpses of white between each of the onyx stones, so it is a tradeoff.  I don't feel the visible cord is really a negative thing but rather a matter of personal preference.\n\nAs with my prior AmorWing purchases, it arrived in a very nice gift box which was enclosed in a second box for protection.  This makes it very convenient for gift giving since no further wrapping would be required.  I really have zero complaints about this one - it is exactly what I expected and I like the contrast between the onyx and blue stones.  The bracelet is also very comfortable.  I typically wear a watch but rarely wear other jewelry on my wrists so I wondered if I would be bothered by this... but after a few hours I forgot it was there and I've worn it daily since.  Overall I'm very pleased with this one.  This product was received at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased review.", "summary": "Nice Contrast - Unisex Sizing and Style", "unixReviewTime": 1461542400}

Finding a racerback bra in my size that actually looks cute and has cute details, and doesn't cost 80+ bucks?  That's a huge win.  Plus, this company is owned by Chantelle, who make great quality bras, and I believe the quality shows here.  It's comfortable, cute and (in the right size) provides great shape and support.\n\nI don't love everything about this bra.  I actually dislike molded cups, but beggars can't be choosers and I know many women prefer this type of cup.  I would also rather my size be available in more than just black and nude, but that's a typical complaint.

Sometimes finding things that are unique and also well made can be a little bit of a task.  I ended up stumbling across this gorgeous bracelet as I was on a search for jewelry that suits my taste, and could also be charmed or engraved and used for a medic alert piece.  I was absolutely thrilled for the opportunity to try this bracelet at a reduced price for my sincere opinion.  Immediately on getting this piece home I was in love with it.  On sight I could see that its very well made, the gold tone is beautiful, and I also appreciated the weight of it.  I don't tend to like jewelry that is super light as I would easily lose or break it, so I like things that can stand up to me.  The working cuffs are simply excellent, and really made for a very easy time at getting this bracelet on or off.  As an added plus, the cuffs can even represent an appreciation of an alternative lifestyle.  I am looking forward to adding a small charm or two in order to make this into the gold version of my first medical alert bracelet since I did not like the ones I found that were typically the standard boring ID bracelets.  I feel this bracelet will last, and will definitely serve perfectly for showing my individuality, interests, and even medical alert needs once charmed.

The skirt was packaged very nicely and professionally. On the packaging, they offer lots of assistance in the event that something goes wrong with the product which is comforting. The skirt is very versatile. It's very light so you could wear it in the summer, but the texture makes it look somewhat thicker so you could easily use it as a fall/winter skirt and wear tights underneath. With the right sizing, you could dress this skirt up to be very professional as well. The color is very bright and a beautiful royal blue color that works well for all seasons. Overall, it is a great skirt!\n\nHer only complaint was the sizing being off. The waistband is very, very skinny. This style shirt is supposed to be worn higher up so it is usually smaller than your typical hip size. When she tried it on she wore it above the hips as a high waisted skirt and it fit semi-comfortably, but was way too short to wear in public.  Because of the length of the skirt, she tried to wear it on the hips which looked awkward and felt uncomfortably tight. She is a size small and is only 5'3\", but this skirt is a bit tight and is way too short. If you are size extra small or small and not very curvy, this skirt would be perfect and I recommend it, but if you are tall or wear sizes bigger than small or are curvy, I don't think this product will fit very well. That being said, the fit is very flattering if you are small or short enough.

She commented that this dress will be something that she can wear for some time. She's losing weight and this dress will be able to be worn during that process. Comfortable to wear. Soft to the touch. It's just the right combination of black and white chevron against a black bodice. Versatile. Could be worn for every day. Add some jewelry and maybe a sweater or bolero top and you get something more dressy for special occasions. The price was awesome! High quality. Can be washed in the washing machine. She did hers on delicate in a large garment bag and then hung it to dry. Cons: My wife is all of 5 feet tall. The dress is very long on her and had to be hemmed. This was not a big deal. Additionally, the material snags easy so this is not the dress to wear with your cat or dog in your lap.\n\nI was provided this product at no cost to me in exchange for an honest unbiased evaluation.

She's a fan of the bright shine of the diamonds at a medium distance because it reminds her of her home in Kiruna, Sweden. The snow had a similar shine, she says. It took much laundering and fraud in order to earn enough money to grace Svetka with this jewelry and it was well worth it. The weight of it was a small issue seeing as how it weighs about, if not more, than Svetka, herself. I have her hooked up to the Wieldy Exoskeleton Camera Shoulder Load Vest with Double Handle Dual-Damping Arm for DSLR DV Camera that I also bought from Amazon so she has no issues with the heaviness and can easily bench press me which is another bonus. I'd say this is a great buy for any man who needs the perfect gift for his wife(s). The largest perk to this is that if the sun shines at a good angle, you can gain a flawless tan in about three and a half minutes. It's been a necessity since I'll be living in a mountain side with limited availability to the outside world.\n\nThank you very much for reading this review of this gorgeous Tennis bracelet and I bid you farewell!", "summary": "This was the perfect gift for my Swedish housewife", "unixReviewTime": 1464307200}

I pull it down under the waist, then back up to tie in the back.

It fits me well but if you have long arms it might come up short a bit.\nI took a star away because it's not as stuffed with as much down as I though and  for a nyc winter I would've wanted it a bit more thicker. Also the wide A bottom alowes for the wind to go under the coat up the the knees area or higher sometimes. Would have been nice to have an option like a draw string at the bottom so you can close it when it's windy.\nOther than that I love the incorporated scarf feature that comes up quite high and keeps me very warm.", "summary": "Quite nice coat", "unixReviewTime": 1483747200}

I bought the extra small, which is my regular size.  I absolutely loved this skirt from the moment I put it on.  It's fairly high-waisted, so no muffin top.  The denim is soft, with almost a brushed feel, and it's quite stretchy.  It goes with lots of different shirts and sweaters, and can be worn in any season.  I think it looks best with high heeled boots or sandals.\n\nIt fits like a glove - so much so that I was concerned that if it shrank at all it would be too small.  I washed it in cold water, dried it on extra low and removed it immediately.  Not only did it not shrink, it came out completely free of wrinkles, which made me love it even more.\n\nThe reason I rated this skirt four stars instead of five is that it came with the button holes stitched but uncut.  I have no idea what the proper way to cut them might be.  I  ended up just taking a paring knife and poking a hole through the material, widening it a bit, and finishing with scissors.  The first one I did came out messy, and I wish I had started at the bottom button, which would have been less noticeable.  But really, I doubt anyone's going to be looking very closely at my button holes!\n\nAll in all, a fantastic skirt for a very good price.\n\nAUGUST 6, 2016\nLITTLE \"FYI\" NOTE ON BUTTON HOLES:\n\nRecently, while shopping for pants, I came across a Chinese seller's warning that the button holes would be uncut.  The reason given was that, in China, uncut button holes indicate that the clothing is new and unworn.  An article of clothing with open button holes would be considered second hand.\n\nSo, if you're thinking about purchasing this skirt, it seems the button hole issue may be a result of cultural differences, not shoddy manufacturing.\n\nI'm not adding back a star because I think vendors should adapt to their market.  Items sold in the U.S. are expected to be ready to wear - so either cut the button holes or provide an explanation and directions.", "summary": "love it - EDITED AUGUST 6, 2016", "unixReviewTime": 1462060800}

I bought a large but medium would have worked a little better.  I usually wear a size 6/8 in dresses. I decided that the suit works better for me using the strap as it hold the suit up high, otherwise suit is a bit long in the torso.

I nurse my son and Ive been having trouble finding a sports bra that is comfortable and will actually do its job correctly and keep everything situated. I normally have to wear several sports bras including a regular nursing bra while working out. But I don't have to with this sports bra! I ordered the large and it is slightly small but I can still wear it and it is still super comfortable even though its a tad bit small. I chose the grey color and love it. I wore this while taking a 5-hour road trip to visit our friends in South Carolina. It felt like I wasn't wearing anything thats how comfortable it is.  The pads are removable, and straps are adjustable in the front which makes it easy to adjust rather than having to take the whole thing off to fit to your size. The only downside for me is I so wish they made and XL size or sizes for bigger busts. The description says this sports bra is for cup sizes C and under. Which is a bummer because Im definitely bigger than a C. I have been looking all over for a comfortable and supportive sports bra that fits my size. Maybe the company can consider making this bra in bigger sizes. Either way I highly recommend!\n\nPros\n-Comfortable\n-Breathable\n-Does its job by keeping everything situated\n-Supportive\n-Easily adjustable\n-Removable pads\n\nCons\n-Only for sizes C cup and under.

But this one truly justifies the  \"High Impact Support\" claim.  The first thing my teen said when she tried it on was, \"This is a GREAT running bra!\"\n\nIt's NOT one of the underwire, push-up sports bras. It has a wide, stretchy band and medium-thick pads that can be removed.  Yes, you get the \"uni-boob\" look,  but that's the price you pay for the kind of support that allows you to do strenuous, active exercise without flopping around.  (Remember Dolly Parton's famous remark that she was afraid to take up jogging for fear one of her bosoms would hit her in the head and cause a concussion?  She could have used one of these.)\n\nWhat sets this one apart is that the shoulder straps are adjustable,  a feature that we've never seen in a sports bra.  In addition to the \"t-back\" there's also a back strap with three hooks for getting a better fit.  The straps are lined with the special \"wicking\" fabric.  The back is porous nylon to prevent sweat build-up.  The hardware is good quality and every seam is neatly double-stitched.  It's a well-made bra.  Ours has been worn and washed (cold water/hung to dry) and we believe it will hold up to use.\n\nI DO think it runs small, but we've gotten used to that problem with on-line clothing purchases and learned to go up a size.  The sizing isn't WAY off, but you should go up a size if you're in doubt.  Again, this is not intended to be a comfy bra to lounge around in, but a support bra for strenuous activity.  If it doesn't fit snugly, it can't do the job.  Keep that in mind when you're considering fit.\n\nThis is a great bra for running or strenuous aerobics, especially for those ladies who are more amply endowed and need extra support.

With constant changes needed for size and support, trying to find one that fits, provides great coverage and support, and is also comfortable, has been hard. Also, buying sports bras online isn't the easiest thing to do. But any mom out there knows that online shopping is your best friend when you have a toddler!\n\nI work out 3-4 times a week, consisting of running on the elliptical and then using weight machines and free weights. After two workouts in this bra, I can say it works well for both types of workouts - both for running/cardio and also for using weights. It stays in place as I do different arm movements and such, and also gives adequate support for running. Note that I'm not a high endurance runner or a bodybuilder, so my experience could be different from yours.\n\nItem arrived in cute package, well branded in a plastic bag. Really helped me like the quality of the brand, unlike others which arrived with no special branding in flimsy plastic. Initial inspection showed a good quality material and a well sewn sports bra.\n\nThe PROS:\n- Smooth, comfortable, fabric\n- Breathable\n- Wide elastic band that doesn't bunch up\n- Supportive padding, not just a flimsy piece of foam\n- Adjustable straps\n\nThe CONS:\n- Wish it came in more colors\n- While the straps are adjustable, they aren't the easiest to adjust. I think it is the wide strap, but that is needed I guess for comfort - so not a huge deal breaker for me.\n\nMeasurements:\n- I purchased a medium size. In the past two years, with being pregnant and breastfeeding, I've been everything between a 32C-34D. At the moment, I'm closer to a 34C and feel like this medium would work for the entire range. So when I have my next baby, I'm glad this bra will work for the duration!\n\nI've tried everything from name brands to discount stores and plenty of online choices as well. I really believe I've found a brand that will work for my lifestyle. I look forward to making more FITTIN purchases.\n\nI received this product at a discount for my unbiased and honest review.

We paid for expedited shipping and got the dress in about a week.  We did need to have it shortened, but this was due to the style of the dress and not an error in measuring.  My daughter wanted to dance without holding it up so we had three inches taken from the length; it does have a slight train to the style which we removed as well.  She received many compliments and it was very pretty.  With shipping it was about $95 which is a bargain compared to the $200-300 other girls paid for their gowns bought locally.

I own a few sets of packing cubes from other brands in various colors and sizes. My observation is that there are premium ones and less quality ones (I own both kinds). This set is definitely premium.\n\nOne thing that sets premium ones apart is the zippers. Each cube in this set has sturdy zippers that have two pull tabs. They are not prone to coming off the tracks like the lower quality cubes. Another thing is the stitching, which on these is close and straight.  Note that the stitching is on the inside of the cubes, and along hem lines.\n\nA feature that I especially like is there are handles across the tops of each cube. To be honest, for their intended purpose I am not sure how useful their are, but for the way I use these cubes they are a nice feature. I organize and store cables and other odds and ends in all of the cube sets that I own. The open mesh allows me to see at a glance if a particular cube has instrument, microphone or speaker cables, or small electronic gizmos that I use on stage. And the construction of these cubes are why I rated them so highly, because cables in the larger cube weigh in at close to eight pounds. This particular brand is sturdy enough to hold them without splitting like lesser cubes are apt to do.\n\nFinally, for folks who are actually using these for their intended purpose, they are labeled with a graphic of what each cube is designed to hold: outer wear, underwear and the such. Not that it needs those since the open mesh reveals what is actually inside, but I thought it was a nice touch displaying attention to detail.\n\nIf you are a traveler these will allow you to pack neatly and actually maximize space in carry-on baggage. If you are a camper or just need bags to organize gear this set is excellent. If you are a musician, this is perfect for organizing cables.

The holes for the arms are wide enough for a toddler and the seamstress must've been embarrassed by my bust size or something because the V-neck goes all the way to my neck. I can't really tell if the bodice fits because I can't get my arms in it properly.\n\nAlso, be warned...it really laces up in the back - that's not just a decorative element that hides a zipper.

I was a little doubtful at first, because it looks very plasticy and cheap in the pictures, but I was pleasantly surprised at the overall quality of manufacture. It's true that the material is quite thin, but it's actually fairly sturdy (or so I assume, because I tend to be quite rough on my clothing, and it hasn't torn at all). The lacing well places and contours well, and the ribbing is a sturdy-yet-flexible plastic that allows this corset to shape correctly for just about any body (I'm very flat-chested, and fairly skinny, which is a body-type that doesn't fit most corsets well). The neck-strap at the top is very sexy and works well, although it took me a minute to figure out how to fold the collar when I first got the corset. Be aware, though, that the back-less design ends up putting a lot of pressure on your neck, so if you have any pre-existing neck issues, you'll want to wear the neck-strap extra loose. The clasps on the front are all steel posts-and-hooks connected to sturdy steel ribbing on each side. I *am* slightly concerned that the steel front-ribs will eventually pierce through the thin material, but so far so good. WARNING: the front ribs are long, and not very flexible, making it harder than normal to sit down in this corset. Even sitting straight up, the ribs will press into the material and risk tearing if you sit for too long.\n\nMy only major issue so far is that the top post from the front clasp broke away and went missing after only three uses of the corset. However, the large number of clasps and strong steel boning of the clasp means that I haven't noticed any adverse effect from having lost that top post. I'm going to request a replacement, due to this defect, but so far I haven't seen any detriment.\n\nOverall, I am thrilled with this product!", "summary": "Great Corset for Any Body Type.", "unixReviewTime": 1437004800}

You might consider sizing up, though, since it is 100% cotton, and we all know how that shrinks. Not the thickest t-shirt but certainly not the thinnest. I do not notice any problems with the stitching, so it seems well made. There are no washing instructions but I assume just regular 100% cotton care.

My initial impression of this 12mm dragon bead bracelet is that there was a good heft to it. The beads have a solidity that gives the impression that these beads are the real thing. But because Im neither a jeweler nor a gemstone expert, Im not certain these are really what they are advertised as.\n\nWhat I can say, however, is that this bead bracelet by fourlady looks to be of good quality. There are no discrepancies on any of the beads and the shine on the beads look very natural. The four red tinted beads have a nice effect very much like what tiger eye stones should look like, and they all have a different natural pattern.\n\nThe center bead of the bracelet is a dragon etched bead that is slightly larger than the rest of the beads. The silver figure is etched directly on the bead and not painted on, which is nice as it means the pattern will last longer. You can depict a serpentine eastern-style dragon on the bead although it took me a while to find the head and the ends of the tail. The dragon on my bead looks different from the dragon on the listing photo which means each of these beads are hand etched and not one of them are exactly the same as the other, which is a nice thought.\n\nI believe the quality of this bead bracelet is very nice and implies authenticity although I have no 100% way to be sure unless I take this directly to an expert to investigate. However, for the inexpensive price, I would say that the bead bracelet is well worth the price due to the feel and heft of the bracelet. The diameter of the bracelet is 12mm, which is slightly large on the average womens wrist, but this is the right size for a male wrist. Still, the bracelet does have a unisex design with a nice color combination. Black and red always look great together.\n\nThis would make a great present to those fashion-conscious friends of yours, both men and women. The elastic that holds the beads together seem to be relatively durable and gives some leeway in terms of wrist size. I received a sample of this dragon bead bracelet for testing and use and this is my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Good heft to a nice bracelet for an inexpensive price.", "unixReviewTime": 1463875200}

These were the perfect length for me, they fit like a glove and I got TWO of them!  What a bang for my buck!  I ordered size large and Im always a little worried with yoga pants. I tend to wear a size medium in most things, but with pants and being bottom heavy(thats where I carry most of my weight in my hips and thighs), I always take measurements and order a size large.  Im glad I did!  The fit was perfect.\n\nUpon inspection, these looked really nice, and when I pulled them on the waistband had some crackling. I immediately worried I had just stretched them out, but upon inspection they were fine. I think its just that material and the first time putting them on.\n\nIve worn both the pink and the gray pair this past week and both are great.  The only SMALL(and not enough to make them unwearable) issue was the fact that on the pink pair I could see my underwear through the side panels because they happened to be a darker pair.  Just something Ill be more cautious of when Im wearing the pink pair in case I plan on wearing those to the 5K Im doing next month.\n\nThese will definitely come in handy for my daily workouts and running like Im planning on doing.

On my monitor it looks like a light/bright turquoise color with a lemon yellow design.  In actuality it is a teal color with a mustard yellow design.

Wagoner", "reviewText": "I am brand new to wearing sleep masks.  I've been trying everything I can think of to stop the dry eye effects of the surgeries I've had to undergo to my lower left eyelid.  These surgeries resulted in losing most of the lower outside corner of my bottom eyelid, leaving more of my eye exposed and making that eye remain partially open as I sleep.\n\nMy granddaughter gave me the bright idea of the sleep mask, but I couldn't decide which type to get.  So I purchased this YUEDGE contoured mask and the Alaska Bear traditional style satin sleep mask with dual straps. I tried this YUEDGE first and liked it very much - except there is no adjusting the back strap.  I fall asleep on my side every night but switch back and forth to my back through the night, and the lack of ability to tighten this mask was the only complaint I could come up with.\n\nI love that my eyelids aren't touched by the mask.  It makes wearing it almost weightless, and it did help some with preventing the air from drying out my eye.  However, it wasn't 5-star perfect because I couldn't get a solid seal by tightening that strip...\n\n...until I used both masks together.  :-D\n\nSo glad I purchased both - the adjustable dual-strap traditional mask over this contoured mask fit the bill perfectly.\n\nA word for those concerned with the dye discoloring your bedclothes.  Soak your sleep mask in vinegar water and wash by hand after a couple of hours. Then hang to dry.

The dress arrived too small (oddly only the skirt lining was 2 sizes too small) and I didn't have the time to risk waiting for replacement that might not fit either. A local dressmaker was able to adjust it perfectly. I fell in love with the dress because of the lace train, but the way it is attached in the back caused it to bunch up and drag behind like a long scarf. My dressmaker was able to reattach it using a large barrette to fan it out a little bit, which worked like a charm. Finally, because there is [gorgeous] lace appliqu throughout the top, the cap sleeves do not stretch, so you just have to be careful raising your arms up too high. Otherwise a comfortable dress.

I'm a bit of a designer, myself, so I was thinking about attaching a hounds tooth hemline to give it more length.

To give some idea about sizing, I am 5'9\" and fairly thin, and I normally wear medium-sized clothes. For this jacket, I ordered one size larger, the US large (Asian XXL), because some people have stated that the jacket runs small. I also compared my own measurements to the ones on the jacket's sizing chart, and saw that the large was probably the the most appropriate size for me. The jacket fits me well and the sleeves are just the right length.\n\nThe jacket has a detachable hood, three outer pockets, an ornamental vertical zipper on the right breast, and one inside pocket. The two lower pockets have smaller pockets on top of them which I guess would be useful for sticking your hands in when you're cold; the openings are on the sides so items would probably fall out.  The inside lining is really smooth and comfortable, and the overall construction seems well done and durable.\n\nA minor but interesting note: There's some pretty amusing Engrish text embossed on the buttons. On my jacket, most of the buttons read \"CLASSIC\", but the one the left cuff reads \"PHYSICAL PLAYBOY\". As a bonus, the rivets on the lower pockets, which are smaller than the buttons, read \"HYSICAL LAYBOY\" due to a lack of space.

Here are things you should know before buying:**\n\n1) If you are between sizes go up a size.\n2) The print with the white background is slightly see-through\n3) The material feels like a textured polyester-- there is an actual zigzag texture to it, not just the print. It is also a little itchy.\n4) The collar and the back insert look like they were attached to change the original style-- the added pieces are VERY obvious and, though they do add a touch of modesty, it would have been cuter without them since they are added in a piecemeal way. (See 5)\n5) No attention to the pattern is paid when cutting the pieces, so your dress might have a big flower over one breast and not on the other creating a lopsided appearance.\n6) This dress looks like it will be a swing skirt in the photos, but it is not. There are large pleats all around the waistline, rather than a circle skirt or a-line, that creates fullness at the waist.\n7) It smelled strongly of chemicals when it arrived.\n\n**The sellers have since contacted me and offered a partial refund. I had already returned the item for all the reasons above, but they asked that I changed my rating so I wouldn't affect their overall rating. I won't change my rating as it is based on the product, not the seller.

I think it's therefore best-suited for people smaller than I am, but I think it looked decent on me (and will therefore look decent on other people of my size.)\n\nAppearance:\nThe color has a nice hue. Some of the ruching is nice, while in other areas it looks a bit like wrinkles (see in pictures.) I LOVE the little cape thing!! It's the detail that drew me to the dress.\n\nComfort:\nAs long as you're comfortable with how the dress looks on you, you should be comfortable in this dress. The fabric feels nice and the dress is long enough that you don't need to worry about flashing anyone.\n\nOverall, I think this is a great dress with some small flaws and it should work well for most people.\n\nDisclaimer: I received a discounted product in exchange for an honest review.", "summary": "Cute dress that should work well for you as long as it fits properly", "unixReviewTime": 1459209600}

They really are a lot like basic socks with the leg warmers attached but i was impressed with the weight of them. They aren't the light weight cheap cotton like you would find at your local Walmart. They are actually a surprising  heavy cotton but with the way its constructed, they actually breath pretty well too which makes these a pretty versatile product. Honestly I wonder why they have never been marketed in the US. Depending on the length of the pair you can scrunch them down pretty far so your not covering your legs to much but if it starts to get to chilli you can pull them WAY up, the longer versions can easily go all the way to the top of your thighs even if you happen to be a bit taller than average their should still be more than enough material for that. That said, they're not very practical for use with anything other than a skirt or dress simply because of the amount of material they have. For example if you tried wearing them with a pair of pants you'd probably just end up with a huge bulge at the bottom of your pants leg or it would look like you were trying to wear sweat pants under your pants. Still, I do really like them and would love to get a few more pairs but the high price makes it hard to justify getting more than the ones I already have.", "summary": "Like leg warmers but better", "unixReviewTime": 1518739200}

My fiance has now been wearing the ring since he popped the question (because he didn't want to wait), and noticed that there is a small ding in the black coating. He doesn't wear it to work, so it's nothing that could've happened there. He's ok w/it, and even said if it continues to happen he'll just re-coat it himself.

My daughter is very thin, so it works perfectly with her body style. The material has good stretch but has stayed form-fitting after several washings. The color also hasn't fadded, nor have any of the beads become loose or misplaced.\n\nThis is a great shirt for layering because of the slim fit, but since the design is so cute, my daughter usually likes to wear it without anything covering it :-)", "summary": "Great fit and price for a cute shirt!", "unixReviewTime": 1480118400}
