In fact I love this top so much it will make an appearance ON my blog in the near future!\nIt fit as expected - I ordered an XXL - I am five foot 3 inches, 140 pounds and have a 38DD chest and larger arms.\nAt first the arms were a tiny bit tight but I stretched them out a little which was easy to do and it looks great! Fit perfect in the chest area. LOVE the draping look and the black sleeves almost look like I have a shrug on top of the blouse due to the way it is stitched on - its like a visual effect.\nGood seaming - no unraveling.\nFabric is nice - the fabric on the black section feels different from that of the maroon section.\nThe maroon section is double layered so you do not need a cami underneath.\nIt breathes well which is important since I am pre-menopasual I get hot flashes and I am feeling cool and comfortable in this top.\nIt just is so complimentary to a larger frame too which I love. The billowing look from the rouching is a nice thing to cover a belly if you have one too.\nI love the color!\nLooks great with jeans, or can easily be dressed up which I will show when I do my blog article - I already have several ideas! Just change your bottoms and shoes and you can easily wear to office, casual or fancy dinner date, or just out and about running errands!\nI will update with better photos once I get the time to take them for my blog article.\nIn the mean time have uploaded a collage with some selfies.\nAs always IF I have any issues in the near future I will update this review.", "summary": "Gorgeous top that can be dressed up or down with ease!

The packaging left something to be desired, so if ordering it for a gift I would take it out of the bag and wrap it flat in tissue in a shirt box or gift bag.\nI like how the design on the outside is a little more stylish. This bag is very large and can hold quite a bit. Plan on taking it as my personal carry on bag on flights. Love the crossbody strap, and how versitile this bag is. The crossbody strap is thick with excellent  caribiner clips. There are two slip pockets inside for phone and keys, as well as two inside zip pockets. One for cash/ coins, and one a bit larger that my kindle voyage will fit inside (about 4x6\").\nOnly downside is that it is a floppy bag and will not stand up on its own. However hardware looks like good quality and the zipper is heavy duty with a thick quality pull.  The leather accents are very pretty. For the price, a great bag to take on a plane as it will go with any outfit, and can easily be squashed down under the seat. The large top zipper is definately a great feature.

According to the size chart, this should have fit for her size but unfortunately it was a bit small. With that being said, I am removing a star for the sizing issue. Now while she was able to get this on, it was too snug for her around her stomach and mid-section. Her breasts fit ok and the length was what I believe it was supposed to be even though she is a taller girl standing at 5 9 tall. We all know that us women are all different shapes and carry our weight differently. My daughter normally wears a size Large (or a 12-14) but this didn't work for her. On the hand, depending on someone else is proportioned, it may work for them. I however would personally recommend ordering a size up. With something like this, it couldn't hurt.\n\nAs for the material and the mini dress lingerie itself, its super pretty and the rose pattern in the lace is adorable. The straps even though this says strapless, are lace and can be worn as straps or worn down further on the arms and not on the shoulders. It just depends what you feel you like and looks nice. There is a little bit of elasticity in the straps. There is not much stretch in the lace to the dress part though. I also do want to mention, the color in the stock photo is more true to the color you get than what my video is showing. Im not sure why my video is making it look more like a light lavender/lilac color but it is almost more of a pinkish color like the stock photo.\n\nI checked this over very well and did not find any holes or flaws in the lace at all. I have purchased similar items before and sometimes there is a hole in the lace but nothing found with this one. This comes with a G-string/thong type panty also to wear underneath. Now that did fit my daughter as expected. There is a cute satin bow that is attached in the center of the breast area with an peep hole which I think really adds to this and makes it real sexy to see the cleavage there. Wearing this for your man will definitely grab his attention.\nI received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

The fit isn't incredibly flattering, at least on me. The jacket looks a little more shapely in the product photos. But.. maybe if you're a little more shapely, it will look the same on you- haha! Anyhow.. I usually wear around a size 4-6US and I ordered the small. I think this was the appropriate size for me. Any smaller and the arms and waist lengths would be too short and any larger and it would be too billowy.\n\nIf you just need a lightweight rain jacket with a hood, I think this is a great option. It rolls up super compactly, making it great for travel and storage. Either keep it in your purse, suitcase, backpack etc, or you could use a carabiner clip to attach it to the outside of your bag, or even a pantloop if you are going for a walk and not bringing a big bag.\n\nThe coat is cinched around the wrists and waist. I assume this helps keep the water out. The waist cinching is adjustable. The jacket zips up tall, which is great for rain protection. There is a hood as well that is adjustable. If you really cinch it up and pull up the front of the jacket as in the picture, very little will be exposed to the elements. Thumbs up for that. Don't want to forget that there are also pockets on each side of the jacket that zipper shut.\n\nThis is a really functional jacket and definitely looks better than a garbage back or a poncho if you get caught in the rain haha. It has some good features and for me the best 2 features are the hood and the packability of this. I am always on the go in day-to-day life and traveling, so this is an ideal way to cover the possibility of rain without taking up too much space.\n\nI received this jacket for free to test and review based on my personal opinion of it.\n\nShades are:&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Swell-Vision-Alani-Coffee-Brown-Bamboo-Sunglasses-with-Smoke-Lens/dp/B01CHDAVB0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Swell Vision Alani Coffee Brown Bamboo Sunglasses with Smoke Lens</a>", "summary": "Ideal For Travel and On-The-Go!", "unixReviewTime": 1464220800}

For reference, I am 5'3\", 130-135 pounds, 34E and wear a size 8 or medium. I bought a large in this dress since it's not a knit material and I wanted to make sure it fit my chest. It fits well but a medium may have worked too. I'm keeping the large though. You can cinch it under the bust as much or as little as you'd like to get the best fit. It creates a very flattering silhouette. The v-neck is low but not too low so I don't need to wear a cami underneath it. With flat shoes, the dress drags the floor about a half inch. With 3 inch heels the length is perfect maxi length. So if you are really tall and want a true maxi dress, this may be too short for you. I was worried that it would be too long for me because I wouldn't be able to get it hemmed because of the design at the bottom. But it works just fine with heels. The green and blue colors are much more vibrant than the picture shows and that's my only real complaint about it. I prefer the softer green that it looks like on screen but it is still very pretty. Overall, I really like it and wold highly recommend it!\n\nUpdate: just bought another dress in mint and it's my favorite so far! These are great dresses! I've got 3 of them now and the mint color is by far my favorite. Absolutely beautiful shades of mint/jade and the fit has improved. The back waistline is elastisized so moving my arms is easier now.

It got here fairly quickly and he was pretty happy with it. It fit just right and it was not itchy or irritate his face at all. In fact it was extremely soft and really comfortable. He even used it under his motorcycle helmet riding and it fit pretty well under his helmet and it kept his face warm. It is great material and we did not have any problems with it shrinking or anything like that once we put it in the wash and dryer. He is pretty happy with it and it is for a really good price. I would say to definitely give it a try. The packaging it came in was clearly from china but I mean what isn't nowadays. It is not super expensive and it really is a quality fleece face mask. I would highly suggest purchasing this one if you are looking for something like this. it is good to have and it would really come in handy during the winter season. You could even use it snowboarding and it would work perfectly. You have the fastens on the sides to make it tighter or even make it loose so that is a nice touch as well.

Once I finally got the entire mask off my skin felt absolutely incredible! Super soft and smooth. It definitely removed all the dead skin and a lot of whitehead/blackheads from my entire face. I will say this though, removing it felt a lot like removing a band aid that has been severely stuck to your arm or leg hair. I had to just rip it off eventually because doing it little by little was taking too long and it was kinda painful. So I tried the whole \"rip it off like a band aid\" and that wasn't the most pleasant experience. However, it was definitely worth it to get that amazingly smooth skin.

Famulily did a superb job with their women's vintage embroidery crocheted lace top, it is simply beautiful, classy, flattering , soft, and definitely good quality. This was such a great find!\n\nFit/ Style\nI was a little hesitant at first regarding the fit, as this is a one size fits all. Once my top arrived, I could not wait to try it on, and boom, it fit perfectly! This is an extremely flattering shape and shows off my shoulders nicely. The design is very classy and will not go out of style, with a very unique draping, it falls right in place. It design covers any flaws you may have without making you look pregnant.\nWhat's great about this style, is that you can wear this casually with jeans, semi dressy with a skirt, professional with dress pants, or dressy with skirt and high heels... very versatile!\nAround the neckline is embroidered area of flower detailing. It's very pretty and eye catching with sparkles. I cannot wear necklaces due to skin issues, but this is the next best thing!\n\nFabric/ Quality\nOne of the first things I noticed when I took the top out of the package, was how SOFT and silky it feels. There are two layers, the bottom being solid color while the overlay draping is sheer ,allowing the drape to have a flawless light flow movement.\nFamulily really put some thought and time into the top. The quality is there. All the seams are stitched well and even. There iare no holes or loose threads anywhere. This top will definitely not fall apart on you, if you care for it properly, it will last.\n\nThe only mistake in my transaction, was that I ordered the pink and recieved the black. To be honest, I am so happy with this top, I am completely fine with it and didn't even bother contacting the seller. It was a happy mistake. Also, I must say that shipping was much faster than I expected, it arrived about a week earlier than the promised date.\n\nOverall, by my review, I'm sure you can tell that I am in love with this top. I would HIGHLY recommend this top to anyone who is looking for a fabulous high quality classy look. Believe me, you will not regret it!\n\nI received this product at a discounted price for an honest and unbiased review.

But it turned out to be much better than I expected. I was pleasantly surprised to see such great quality for a for a fraction of the competitors. I read a lot of the reviews and many complained about the smell, but what I found is that it smells of quality leather. It's a pleasant smell to me. I also read that it can be a bit stiff. I bought both the black one and the brown one. The black was a touch stiff but after wearing it the first day the stiffness is all but gone. The brown was soft already. I think the black was probably a bit stiff from the dye. The snaps are okay. They are easily taken apart but not to a point that it would come open on its own. I have a bit of a thick wrist and was confused about the size. What I didn't realize ( but should have) is that it wraps around the wrist twice. I still have room and I could snap it tighter but I like it loose. It might be a bit big for a small wrist, but comfortable for a large wrist. I love this and wear it every day. Over all I am extremely satisfied with this product. I had thought high price meant quality, but in this case, I'm glad I was wrong.", "summary": "Highly recommend!!", "unixReviewTime": 1497657600}

It's a beautiful dress. But if your a size maybe 8 and order the XL it will be ok. I ordered the size XL 16 /18 and it doesn't even cover my boobs. I'm throughly angry to say the least.\nI don't think it will be worth it to send it back to Asia where it came from.\nI REALLY wish that amazon executives would put restrictions on the sellers and only allow them to sell clothing if it's according to the US size charts. This is the second time I've ordered something that was from over seas that although absolutely beautiful, is not according to the size charts listed. The skirt I ordered before was about a size too small and funny thing they included a US tape measure but the 1\"was actually 3/4 inches. Yeah, that added up. Lol\nIts really sad. They have such beautifully printed fabrics and I love the styles but when the size chart is wrong from the beginning and their measurements are off, your taking a chance when ordering.\nAs much as I adore Amazon, the shipping, choices, etc. I think they are not managing this portion of things correctly and need to get a handle on it so they can satisfy the customers. And even if the supplyers have to charge a bit more for more fabric use and come to code for the US sizing, I'd be happy to pay it so I don't end up having something I paid for but can't wear unless I starved myself for two years.

Watch Video!!\n\nThe bathing suit is really nice. It has a giraffe like a pattern on the top and bottom with the fringe covering the top. The top is strapless and padded but comes with tie straps that can be attached to the suit and tied around the neck. The bottoms are a thinner cut and are by no means full coverage in the back. Holding them up the front and back are cut the same. There are ties on the side to loosen and tighten up the bottoms. Overall I really like the quality and style of this bathing suit and the fit is what I would have expected for my wife. Another cool thing is the fringe on the top, it looks cool. I like that you can wear the top with or without the straps, perfect for sunbathing\n\nThe swimsuit looks just like in the picture, the sizing is spot on, I ordered a large, and it fits perfect. She usually wears a large in bottoms and her top size is 36C and this large bikini fits perfect on the bottom and a little snug on top! The color is just like in the picture. Plus I happened to have the opportunity to purchase this at a highly discounted price and the only thing required of me is leaving a review of the product on Amazon and I reserve the right to update my post in the future if my experience changes with time, either good or bad.\n\nIf you like detailed video and picture reviews PLEASE VOTE YES BELOW! and subscribe to my youtube channel\n/WKBFEAR\n\nThank you", "summary": "The bathing suit is really nice.

My underbust measurement is 25 inches/bust measurement 31 inches and I feel like it would easily billow out if I'm doing anything other than hanging out dry. I'll have to adjust it on the sewing machine since there are no ties and there aren't any adjustable clasps, either. And it might be because I'm very short, but the halter straps are much too long.

For reference, I'm 5'0\" and 90lbs, but my butt is rather big for my frame.

I have a small frame, so I'm a bit smaller in the chest and that was where I had a problem: the halter top design, while cute, went a little too low on the sides and so makes me feel that if I do any sort of running or exert any kind of exercise swimming, I might have a wardrobe malfunction. If the top came with adjustable straps instead of the elastic material, this would be a five-star suit for sure. I might have someone alter it because I want to give this bathing suit a try.\n\nAlso, I guess I assumed too much from the picture, but I assumed that the top design was going to be embroidered. I was mistaken; instead, it is part of the pattern of the bathing suit itself. Okay, that's not such a big deal--the colors are still bright and the pattern is there, but it is not quite what we see in the picture. The top comes with removable pads that you may or may not want in the suit, depending on your preference. For me, they didn't really make much of a difference, so I left them in.\n\nThe bottom, on the other hand, fit me perfectly and looks really cute! I love the side cutouts, they're sexy without being too vulgar. I might even change up the bikini tops with some others to go with this bottom; because it's black it's super versatile.\n\nI have not had a chance to field test this bikini at the beach or pool, but I plan on doing so soon. Overall, the fit is a little weird for my body type on top, but I still like the pattern and the style and think that it's a pretty good quality for a knockoff coming from China.\n\n** I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

The halter top is very cute and fashionable and keeps what I want covered, covered. The sides of the bottom are not so tight that it pulls on my skin and it fits just right. The overall quality of this product is more than I expected and nicer than most bathing suits I own.

I decided that was okay, it wasn't really noticeable. Then I tried to wear it, and found out that the clasp is so tiny that it's nearly impossible to re-hook. I had to hang the pendant on a spare chain just to be able to wear it. I wouldn't recommend this if you're looking for a really nice piece of jewelry, and I probably would have sent it back but it wasn't worth the trouble to ship.

I use the socks for yoga but I've found that they are also great \"around the house socks\". The grips on the bottom make sure that my feet don't slip on wood or tile. I even use them for \"sleeping socks\" because they cover my feet enough to keep them comfortable and having the open top and open toes means that my feet don't overheat in the night. No more sticking my feet out from under the covers to get cool!! They also keep their shape and don't overstretch. They also have the cutest inspirational yoga saying on the bottom.

I DO have a unique sense of style, and these adorable little socks play into that really well.\n\n What I learned from using it - If there's any doubt about the colors offered, the truth is that the seller picks three random colors to send when you purchase this item. I would have liked to choose my colors, personally, but in my case I ended up with my three favorite possible colors: Black, grey, and light purple. Now, I have somewhat large feet (size 10/11 women's, 9ish men's) so at first wear these are somewhat tight, but after wearing my black pair for a week or so, on and off, they are far more comfortable now.\n\n How good is it, really? Well they're adorable, I love the fingerless gloves concept and these play into that in a very unusual and quirky manner. I also find that I'm not usually fond of toe socks because they make my toes too warm, but the \"toeless\" socks are the perfect solution. The opening at the top is both cute and keeps my feet a little cooler, too (I tend to have hot feet) and there are rubbery dots underneath the feet that grip the floor well but also are substantial enough that I feel like I'm walking on very small and widely spaced pebbles. Also on the bottom in the middle of the foot are the words \"Enjoy Yoga,\" which doesn't exactly apply to me but is cute nonetheless. It bothered me at first, but I got used to it. Either way, I absolutely love them.\n\nIn summary, these socks are unique and quirky and adorable. I'm not honestly sure how they would be for yoga or dancing, since I do neither of these things, but I can tell you that they are comfy and fun for wearing around the house and relaxing on chilly days. I'm super happy I bought them, and would happily recommend them to anyone looking for some cute workout/dance/yoga/chill-around-the-house socks!\n\nFor disclosure purposes, I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. HOWEVER, with that said, I purchased this item because it's something I would have purchased anyway, discount or no, and my review is composed 100% of my own thoughts and opinions.

The material is substantial and the dress is well-made. The front buttons up with pearl-shaped white plastic buttons, which was a nice touch. The cut is very flattering, and the arms were just right. I'm not a small person, and my upper arms are pretty big, but this dress's sleeves didn't squeeze my arms, nor were they baggy.

If you're average height or taller, however, I wouldn't hesitate to get this dress.

It's a mesh and lace combination with adjustable shoulder straps.  There is a nice,  thick band of lace that wraps around the body,  just below the bust.  I found that it was at my slimest point of my torso,  which made for a very flattering fit.  The bust consists of a very deep V cut with some sheer lace and mesh covering the breasts, but leaving very little to the imagination.  I am a large C and had no issues with being covered or fit.  There is absolutely no support in the bust,  but if you shorten the shoulder strap,  the lace will sit close to the body and give a little hold for some decent cleavage.  The 4 star rating is because of the slit running so far up in the front.  The bottom of this bodysuit is a see through mesh that seperates to fit around each leg, giving it an open crotch.  The slit for the open crotch extends up to the belly button (which is the weird part) and leaves the butt  exposed as well.  Think running shorts with an open crotch.  The legs are flowy,  but still very short.  I'm usually a 14/16 and wear XL tops and L bottoms.  I used their size guide and ordered the XXL and was pleased with the fit.

I ordered a US size medium, i'm a 32C, 29 waist and 44 hips so obviously a little bit of a triangle shape.  The product came very fast and looked like the picture when i laid it out and i was really excited for it, until i put it on that is.  It looked terrible on and wasn't flattering at all like it is on the model.  The bottom of the boob section actually went down to my belly button and i couldn't tighten it, even thought that is an option, but the tighter i did the straps the worse it got.  The area on the models belly button was at the top of my hips and then the shorts started and ended about where they do in the picture.  Now since i have wider hips i knew it wouldn't be flowy like it is on the model and that didn't bother me.  Maybe this product is just not made for my body idk. The open crotch tho is not really and open crotch more so open bottom it goes from the top of the short all way around the back to the top of the back of the short.  Which i think is really awkward because its almost like a hospital gown in the back so instead of it being like a surprise peek a boo it was an oh this is \"crotchless\" When i turned around to see the back or turned to the side to see the back, the back is not fitted at all and it pulls weird and leaves about a 3\" gap between my back and the fabric so it kid of makes you look bigger than you are.  Now my bf loves almost anything fitted i wear for lingerie but he hated this one i showed it to him and he said yeah no i don't like it either i don't think you should ever wear that.  I would not recommend this to anyone.  I received this product at a discount for my honest opinon.", "summary": "Would not recommend this it looked bad on me", "unixReviewTime": 1469664000}

(Nevermind that they have the sizes reversed, so that the 34 inch bust is listed as a \"Small\", and the 32.7 bust is listed as the Large (which I pointed out to them but they still haven't changed).  Anyways, in what world is a 34 inch bust *large*?)  But because I looked at the size measurements before ordering, I knew to order a medium;  if I'd ordered a small (which ordinarily would be the right size) it would definitely have been too small.\n\nBut that's not even the reason that this dress is getting a one star review.\n\nTo start, the zipper bunches up, rather than laying flat, and mind you this is on a woman with a very tall, slender frame (not me, my son's girlfriend - it should *not* have bunched up  - it isn't a matter of not having the length to lay flat, it's a matter of poor craftsmanship).\n\nThen, the stripes aren't even lined up at all.  In the picture, now that I look closely, not all of them are lined up along the seam (although some are).  But in the dress I received, they aren't lined up anywhere, at all.\n\nFinally, the material.  Note how *nowhere* does it say what this dress is made of.  Well, here's what it feels like:  a shower curtain.  It looks like soft, slinky material in the picture, but it is actually slippery, and does not feel good on the skin.\n\nOverall, a very disappointing experience. :-(\n\nIn full disclosure, this company sent me this to review, however I am not bashful about giving my true opinion of a product (clearly).", "summary": "Too Small, Not Well-Made, Very Disappointing", "unixReviewTime": 1461542400}

The top fits extremely well and was by far the most comfortable swimsuit I've reviewed this season. Most plus size swimsuits have built in cups that are way too big for me or the swimsuit is made for people shorter than me. This top actually fits my chest size and height perfectly. I'm 5'6 and a large B or small C cup. This top does have a small pad in it that is non-removable. You could easily cut a small slit in the back to remove the pad if you wish. The only thing I don't like about the top is that it floats up while swimming. I had to tuck it into my bottoms to get it to stay put. I would probably only wear this top for splash pads, waterparks, or water gun fights. I don't like swimming in it.\n\nThe swimsuit bottoms though they don't fit at all. I feel like they are two sizes smaller than the top. The tag in it says it's a size 58 just like the top but it's way too small. I ordered size Size: 4XL(US 18-20W) to get bottoms that fit I would need the 6XL. If I ordered the 6XL the top would be too large for me. I'm saving the bottoms for when I loose some more weight.\n\nRatings (Out of five stars):\nMaterial Quality: \nStitch Quality: \nCup Size & Removability: \nStyle: \nValue: \n\nOverall rating: 23 out of 25 stars / 4.6 Star Average\n\n SUMMARY: This is a well made comfortable swimsuit. The cup pads aren't removable but could be easily removed. This swimsuit is perfect for smaller cup sizes A-C I'd say would be perfect fit for this one. Larger sizes might not like this due to the lack of support. I found the bottoms to be two sizes smaller than the top. This suit has straight stitching, no loose threads or seams. Quality wise, this is a very well made swimsuit.\n__________________________________________________________\n\nI received this product complimentary from M&Z for quality testing purposes.

I substituted the brief style bottoms with a pair of navy spandex bike shorts that are longer and those worked perfectly for me. These brief bottoms fit better than another suit from the same seller that came with boy shorts. I tend to run larger in the bottom than the top so I'm not surprised.\n\nThe top has wider straps than most suits and that makes the suit much more comfortable. The straps are also adjustable with metal fittings. The skirted suit is very generous with the fabric and it drapes beautifully like a babydoll. The ruffling on the front is a bit more out there than the picture portrays, but it is nice to have decorative details added, that is rare for plus size suits. The open back adds some interest to the top without baring too much. The colors are bright and vivid, the fit is true. The construction is very good and this suit seems like it was really made with a larger woman in mind. It fits and flatters.\n\nI'm about to go on vacation with my new suits & will post a picture of the suit in action when I get back.\n\nDisclosure:  I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

I have broad shoulders and a full bust - while I wear medium in standard shirts, most button-up shirts I have to order a large, but for this shirt I needed to order an XTRA Large.\n\nNow with that being said, once you order the correct size, it really is a fantastic shirt. I like that the sleeves come halfway down the upper arm instead of cap up near the shoulder. With my wider shoulders, capped sleeves always made my arms look huge, but this shirt keeps things balanced.\n\nThe material seems well put together and the fabric isn't thin or sheer at all.

I love lingerie but hate the price tag, especially considering that they usually don't last much past the 3rd wash or so. What impresses me so much about Singlelady's sets is quality of the material and how affordable they are compared to store prices. Even though the material is sheer, it isn't so paper thin that I have to worry that it will snag or tear with use. It actually feels like I could have this for a couple years and will last fine. The cut and design of this set is so sexy. I ordered mine in a powder/sky blue color and I think it helps soften the look. Its definitely risque, the breasts and crotch are uncovered and on display, if you know what I mean, but I think the softness of the blue changes it from \"va va vixen\" to \"unexpectedly freaky girl next door\".  I really like it and my  boyfriend seemed incredibly happy with it lol. I'll continue to order lingerie from Singlelady because so far, it's the first brand of lingerie I own that doesn't feel so overly delicate and they are super affordable.  I would (and have already) recommend them to friends and others as well.\n\nI did receive my lingerie at a discounted promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes.

The best way to measure is to have the exact measurements of your body on hand. You will be able to choose the size that fits you best. The size I ordered worked perfectly. I only had issues with the length of the fabric on my legs, it is much shorter than the photo. It does not depend on what size you get you can clearly tell by looking at it that its short. I would have liked for it to be longer. It does have lace on the fringe part which makes this look more attractive than some of the others I've seen. These are stretchy and breathable.

The charms are shiny silver and the blue accent beads give it a pop of color.\n\nI have another, much more expensive, name brand cheap bracelet in this style that I love as well. Unfortunately, because of the cost, it is a very slow process to add charms to the bracelet. It's nice to be able to purchase a bracelet that is already full of charms so there is no waiting to fill it up.\n\nThe bracelet has five silver charms, eight turquoise colored accent charms, and one dangle charm. There is also plenty of room to add a handful of additional charms if you would like. The bracelet is set up almost asymmetrically. There is one silver owl charm and one silver charm with a turquoise crystal dangle ball charm in the center. Working your waypoint from the those two center charms, the charms are identical in both sides. Starting in the center, you have a multi crystal blue charm, a silver charm, a blue faceted charm, a blue inlaid charm, another blue faceted charm, and finally a silver charm decorated with tiny flowers. The bonus owl charm is super cute, but the dangle ball charm is my absolute favorite. The charms are easy to remove and rearrange, but I like the balanced look of the way it came.\n\nI had no trouble opening or closing the clasp. I simply slip my thumb nail into the slit on the clasp and it pops right open. The opposite end has a little nun in the end that lays in the open clasp and then the clasp snaps shut over it secure the lock. The clasp stays securely shut and I have had no problems with it popping open accidentally. It can be slightly tricky to put on by yourself, but no more so than any other bracelet. The bracelet is comfortable and fits perfectly - not so big that it slips off, but not too tight. None of the charms are scratchy or catch on the fine hairs in my arm or on my clothing.\n\nThe bracelet is not solid sterling silver like some of the more expensive name brands but it's a great option for someone who can't afford or doesn't want to spend a lot of money on a solid sterling bracelet. It's also perfect for a young girl who may not properly care for or possibly even lose a more expensive bracelet.\n\nThere is an identical pink option if that is  more your style. Both are equally pretty.\n\nThe bracelet comes packaged in a black velvet pouch and then inside a little black box. It is perfect for gift giving.\n\nI have included two photos of the bracelet on my wrist. I took one photo with a flash and one without in an effort to catch the truest color of the bracelet.\n\nI received this ice blue charm bracelet at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review of the product.", "summary": "Cute, affordable alternative to more expensive charm bracelets with the same look.", "unixReviewTime": 1460332800}

There's a little bit of a learning curve to program it and the instructions won't tell you that the top and the bottom of the watch (with respect to the center part that tells time) are what's used used to adjust the numbers time and date. The watch tells time when you touch the surface but easily picks up smudges which is only a minor inconvenience. The red LED display is bright in total darkness and in direct sunlight you'll need to cup your hand over it for enough shade to see the numbers. There are no knobs or dials so all the programming is through the touchscreen display. You can also program the date and a short message (example \"do great things\") for inspiration or whatever you prefer. If you touch it to tell time, swipe upwards for the date, alarm, and 1 or 2 other features that I don't use. The time also has a 24 hour military format if you choose. I had to resize the watch but it was worth the hassle. Don't expect a $100 watch when you get this. I also wouldn't recommend swimming with this or using this in heavy rain. The surface picks up scratches if you're not careful and the coating that protects the metal will discolor over time. I think the watch is dollar for dollar one of the best I've recently purchased.

Therefore, between my daily and nightly uses I could have about half a dozen handbags to clean out by the end of the week.\n\nWhen I shop for a handbag, it must meet my four personal requirements.\n\nI definitely look for something unique, and not the same type that I see in the department stores, as they all start looking the same to me.\n\nI want a handbag that will last and therefore, I choose a bag that has a good construction as well as a unique design.\n\nAffordable is another requirement, as I am no longer willing to pay hundreds of dollars for a handbag. In addition, that includes the handbags with the fancy designers label name.\n\nI purchased this handbag in the middle of July and this was my favorite handbag that I used throughout the last few months of summer and until the end of September.  I loved this handbag when I first received it, and now at the end of the season, I love it even more.\n\nThis handbag is custom-made for my personal style, it has the distinctive vintage appearance and it makes an eye-catching and bold statement. The synthetic leather exterior is as realistic as my real leather handbags, and the flawless workmanship offers impeccable attention to all of the design details.\n\nI bought the white handbag with the three-dimensional flower that is subtly outlined in a darker color. An interesting feature is the dark perimeter that seems almost looks navy when I wear blue, charcoal when I wear grey, and black when I am wearing black. The handles, kiss type of closure and the rest of the hardware has a shiny gold-tone finish, with a subtle geometric design along the handles and the top perimeter frame.\n\nThe handbag offers two assorted methods of wear, an adjustable shoulder strap with a sliding brass buckle that attaches with large brass clips to the side brass rings. The large clips are easy to fasten and I don't chip my fingernails when I need to either attach or remove the shoulder strap.\n\nThere a one long zippered compartment along the back exterior of this bag and this easily fits my large Samsung Galaxy Note 3 cell phone, or my over-sized sunglasses that I always bring with me. I like this one long outside pocket in the back, as it keeps the things I need conveniently accessible without having to dig inside the bag.\n\nThe interior fabric lining is strong and durable, its washable, and it will NOT rip or tear easily. I like that this lining is stitched down securely, rather than loose and flowing because when a handbag has the extra loose material, I cant see where things are, and any extra and loose material makes it harder to take things out. The interior of this handbag features 6 spacious sections and compartments. There are two open sections stitched into the side lining that are reinforced and strong. If I choose to use the outside back compartment for my large sunglasses, then one of these compartments will accommodate my large Galaxy Note 3, standing upward and within its case. The other open side section is the same, only a bit smaller.\n\nThere are two large and deep zippered pockets on the other side, with another wide-open section. Any of these three areas are large enough to hold my blush compact, lipstick, eyeliner, mascara and more, everything that I might need to refresh my cosmetic appearance during the day. This also has enough room for my full-size brush and comb. In addition, any of these areas provides a place for anything that needs quick accessibility that would otherwise be lost down deep in the bag.\n\nThe last section is the largest one and this is spacious for a full size wallet, or even a paperback book, and on a rainy day, I can include a compact fold-up umbrella.\n\nI love the size of handbag, its large but not ridiculously over-sized, and I love the big bold three-dimensional flower with all the details. The workmanship is as precise and as faultless as I would expect for any expensive designer handbag. As a fashion statement, this handbag would be the fashion focal point when wearing either a pattern or solid colors. The deep color along the perimeter of the flower petals seem to pick up and enhance different hues of blue or navy, black or charcoal grey, and whatever dark color Im wearing.\n\nThis is my all-time favorite warm weather handbag, and if/when, we go somewhere warm for our winter vacation I will bring this one with me. It makes a perfect transition from casual daytime to evening wear and it has an elegant, chic and stylish appearance that sets it apart from the ordinary.", "summary": "My Favorite Warm Weather Handbag  Excellent Design and Construction  Unique and Trendy Appearance - Goes with All My Outfits", "unixReviewTime": 1475625600}

Cards", "reviewText": "I ordered the black bag with the red rose and green braided handles.  It is a very pretty purse.\nThe colors are pretty true to the picture: the black is a matte shade; the green is a kind of forest green which complements the red and black very nicely.  I like the green handles which are easier to carry than the handles in the other choices/styles offered.  Also green handles make it a little more unique than black handles.  The size of the bag works for me, but it is larger than what is described.  At the top across its widest part, the bag is about 17, and the bottom is 12.5.  It measures 11 in height, and about 6  in depth.  This gives you ample space to fit all your stuff in.  There are metal feet which protect the bottom of the bag. There is an exterior zip pocket, and a zip closure on top.  Inside, there is a middle zip compartment.  On one interior back wall are two slip pockets; the other side has a zip pocket. These pockets make access and organization easy. As mentioned, there is a removable shoulder strap.  There are many details about the\nbag that I really like.\nUpdate:  I have been using this bag now for a few months, and it still looks like new.  It is very well made, and every part of it is holding up well. I have gotten many compliments about it.  It is apparently similar to a style made by Pijulski, a far more expensive brand.  This Realer bag may not be real leather, but frankly, who cares?  It looks and feels like leather, and most importantly, it is apparently durable. By the time it wears out, I'll probably want something else anyway.", "summary": "Nice looking bag with good organization", "unixReviewTime": 1466553600}

I had never even thought about them before until I started seeing ads everywhere.  I must say they are such a great help when it comes to travel and I highly recommend them to EVERYONE who travels on even a semi-regular basis.\n\nThat being said there are many levels of quality of packing cubes.  So far I own two different sets.  This is the second set I purchased.  At first I was a little disappointed because straight out of the bag they look and felt a little 'cheaper' than my other set.  However, once I started to use them I realized that they had some benefits that more than made up for it.  My first set, though nicer looking and feeling, is flimsy once packed.  For example, if I was to pack it pull of underwear and swimsuits and take one out, the rest might fall out with it.  This one has more strength to the sides of it that keep it upright.  So if I only half it half full it will still have some of the boxy shape to it to hold the contents in place.  This benefit is far superior to the 'pretty' factor.\n\nThe color was a lot lighter than the picture, which I wasn't a huge fan of.. but as I mentioned, function over looks at this point.  I'm also not sure why someone really needed the three different laundry bags but no big deal.  I decided that I'm going to use the small one to put medicines in for an additional level or organization.  The other two I'll split for various different items.\n\nOne thing you may not realize until you run into it, is that when TSA picks your bag to go thru, they can leave you with quite a mess.  This way they can go thru your luggage and assuming they don't dump your zippered bags out, leave you with a somewhat organized bag still afterwards.\n\nSo overall:\nPros:  Sturdy, functional, hold quite a bit more than my other set even though they look as if they are smaller, GREAT help in packing/organizing.\n\nCons: Not as fancy looking as others, I wouldn't call it waterproof as only the sides would prevent water from getting it.  The top is mesh and if you spilled something wouldn't prevent it from getting on your items.\n\nAlthough I did receive these items at a discount my review in order to review, the review is my honest experience with the product and will be updated based on long term use of the items.", "summary": "Much sturdier than other cubes I own!", "unixReviewTime": 1462147200}

Packing cubes, in general, are true travel must-haves.  It is amazing how much more you can pack and how well-organized you will be.  They simply make your vacation or business travel MUCH better.\n\nThese Alex Studio bags are the Bomb!  First, there are a total of six bags in different sizes.  That is a lot of bags.  For my next trip I will be able to have a bag for each destination since there are four hotels in my journey.  They are well-constructed with the mesh sides (on the non-waterproof bags), which serves two purposes:  Customs people can examine your bag without a mess and At one glance you know what the cube holds.\n\nThere are my first cubes for my wet or dirty clothes and I am very pumped about these.  My travels keep me on the go sometimes changing cities or even countries daily.  I plan to use one for my bathing suits, one for my undergarments (which I will wash myself since my trip is 3 weeks).  The 3rd, which is quite large, will hold my laundry garments that I will have the hotels wash. If you travel at all never blow off hotel laundry - it will make your load lighter in your suitcase and I have never been disappointed.\n\nOh and the color is very pretty.  The cubes arrive in a storage bag which is pretty hand to keep them compacted and ready for the next trip.\n\nI received this item at a discount for my personal evaluation.  As a long-time user of cubes, I can highly recommend AlexStudio - a great bang for your buck.", "summary": "Great selection of different sizes", "unixReviewTime": 1461456000}

I travel a lot and only recently decided to get packing cubes.

No more endlessly digging through for \"that t-shirt\" to leave everything in a jumble. You just need to pull out your designated pack and there you go. I also like the laundry bags for dirty clothes or personal items, but I think I'm still going to pack some extra plastic grocery bags as a back up.\n\nThe quality of these bags is decent- I had a stray thread which was keeping the largest cube stitched mostly closed, but snipped that and it was all good. The mesh and fabric seem sturdy and I hope they hold up. I have not tested the waterproof capabilities of the laundry pouch but the cubes are not waterproof as the lids are mesh. Zippers are pretty standard, nothing really stands out as good or bad. They all work easily. Finally, the fabric is a lighter blue than depicted in the photo, not too big of a deal but they're not as vibrant.\n\nI am interested to see how these hold up to being in my back pack on my next trip and am looking forward to not having the contents of my bag wrinkled or thrown everywhere when I'm looking for my things!!\n\n I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.", "summary": "Convenient, should do the trick", "unixReviewTime": 1461369600}

This fit me very nice. I hope the sticky inside won't fade out after few times usage. The main issue I was concern is this bra won't give you any push-up support. It basically just cover your ladies and push them to the center a bit. You shouldn't expect any push-up effect since unlike the normal bra this one has no strap to pull up.

It's very versatile and very useful for us girls to fit just about any outfit we would want to wear. The reason why I took off a star was because there's no instructions. I am lucky because I know how to use this bra and how to take care of it because I have another one that is similar to this that came with very detailed instructions on how to careful and how to apply this bra.

Well, maybe not a hard time but I think that it would not be as effective and useful had I had instructions on how to use it properly. Yes, it is a very simple product. It's a bra and most of us ladies that are old enough to use this all have common knowledge on how to use a bra but even just a quick set of instructions would be nice. But besides that this bra is very useful. Again, it's very versatile and I think that it's a must have just for those few articles of clothing that you'd rather not show your bra straps in. It's not as comfortable as a regular bra would be but than again the only bras I find comfortable are sports bra so some women might find this very comfortable. The reason why I find it slightly uncomfortable is because of the adhesive that's on the bra that keeps the bra on your boobs. I have sensitive skin so when I have it on for long periods of time it tends to be uncomfortable for me. But for most people I think that's not an issue.

The canvas is thick and strong but nice and smooth too.  Its lined to help keep any possible leaks contained, and the zippers are durable and easy to zip and unzip.  In my video I was able to unzip them with just my left hand while using my right to hold my phone.  Also in my video you can see how much stuff easily fits inside this Yuedge bag without even packing it totally full.  Its not large enough to hold my big can of hairspray or my big hairbrush, but it can hold most everything else imaginable that I will need to shower, shave, etc.  Well, it might be big enough for the hairbrush and hairspray, but there wouldnt be much room left (mine are really big lol).  I got this bag mainly for my husband to have available whenever his current toiletries travel bag wears out.  He travels a lot and his luggage gets worn out and has to be replaced every so often.  Also it will work well for most of my bathroom necessities and I can toss my hairbrush and hairspray into my duffle bag or something, for just an overnight trip when I want to pack light.\n\nHonestly I wasn't sure this bag would be very good quality when I ordered it, but I was glad to see when it came that it really is high quality and seems to be made to last a long time.  Really the only reasons I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think it could use another pocket inside to help organize things a little better.  (The outer pocket is very tight and doesnt hold much.)  And theres an odd brand name on it that I have no idea where it came from because its not the seller I guess.\n\nThis YUEDGE Toiletry Bag was provided with discount for me to test and review based on my personal experience and opinion.", "summary": "This bag actually is better than I expected!", "unixReviewTime": 1468454400}

I love that this bag has double accessibility with the panoramic zippers ;it opens from the top with 2 horseshoe shaped zippers. There is a smaller outside zipped pocket where you can store your toothbrush, toothpaste or razors and a 1 inch handle at the end of the bag for convenient portability. Once opened, you can store about ten 3-ounce travel sized bottles and still have some room for deodorant and toothpaste. The inside also has a little zip up area which is great for dental floss, picks, tweezers, nail clippers and personal scissors or small items that need to be stored alone. Another great component is the strong tabbed hanger at the \"lid\" of this toiletry case which can make this hang on a hook, tent pole or hanger. As for quality, I love the qualityI am hoping that the tabbed hanger will hold up in time when filled. Great sizenot too big and not too small but the shape is perfect to carry and access. It is water resistant on the outside and wipes off very easily. The double zippers are good quality and the blue is a deep navy blue.\nMy 4 star review is due to the interior of my bag which does not resemble the interior picture on Amazonit appears that the bag's pictures on this site have 3 or 4 allocated pockets where you can stand some colognes or bottlesmy bag just had 1 outside zippered pocket  and 1 inside lid meshed breathable zippered pockettheir listing is accurate but their interior picture is misleading.\n\nI purchased Yuedge's Toiletry Bag at a discount in exchange for my honest review.

I keep all of the eyeshadows, blushes, bronzers, foundations,concealers, powders and lipsticks in this compartment.  There is a mesh zippered compartment at the top of the zippered lid - once you unzip and open the main compartment, the flap has the zippered mesh area.  In this section I keep my makeup brushes and sponges.  There is a front zippered section that  is in the front of the bag and is the full length of the bag -- this is where I keep my eyeliners and mascara.\n\nThis is the perfect bag for me and I really like it.

I don't mind it for a night out with the girls or out on a date but not for work. All in all, it is a nice shirt that could be dressed up or down with dress pants or a with some jeans. It could be a very versatile piece for the closet. Also, my picture of the shirt is a little misleading as well. The red is bright but not quite as bright as in my picture.

And the manager of worldbridge products got in touch with me for the issue i have with their product.\nFirst, I am impressed and appreciate their approach and totally work with me so i will get the best out of my purchase, they offer me a new one which arrived yesterday. it was in a good condition and no issue with this new one.\nThey only not offer a good quality product but they have the best costumer service i have ever dealt with. They respond to my inquiry in timely manner and did resolve the issue without costing me any dime.\nI highly recommend their products especially this RFID leather wallet they have. ,my husband was stoked i got him this one and literally he quoted \"this is the most hi end expensive type of wallet he ever owned\" and he is very happy there is a new one that he can use. He is extremely happy with this product and i do recommend for someone who wants to have a high quality product wallet at a very affordable price, this is a good choice/bet you can have.\n\nThanks to MR. Simon who is reaching out to me to solve my issue. Here is the picture for the new wallet they sent.\nHappy buyer here for sure... Thank you!!!\n\nmy husband loved it.\n\nThough there is a little tear on the seam where the leaf is attached, the one where you put picture with, that is the only mild issue. other than that, my husband is very thankful i got him this one. he has no choice as the old wallet was badly torn apart by our 15 month old son.\nHe likes the quality he said and thank me like 10 times for saving him having no wallet for days.", "summary": "husband loved it", "unixReviewTime": 1471651200}

Im typically a size 4-6 so the medium was perfect. I would equate that to a small. I was a bit skeptical of how this lingerie would really feel.  To my surprise, the description of this lingerie dress is true! The lace that covers the breast area is soft, even at the seams.  I couldn't get over how it felt on my skin.  I was not impressed with the quality of the ribbon that was used.  As part of the dress, it seems soft enough, but the section of ribbon that you would tie a bow in the middle of the dress was a bit stiff.  I wouldve preferred a more satin type of ribbon for that part.  The mesh (?) for the remainder of the dress was fine and it is pleated at the chest as pictured.  The straps for the dress will do, but they have these little loops on the edge of the elastic that Im almost certain will get caught on something like your ring. The G-string that is included is made of the same material as the dress itself so it too is soft.  The seat of the G-string runs right down the middle of the panty, which visually is annoying.  I like to have an extra cotton layer where your lady parts would be.  But, because the mesh/lace is soft, it doesnt seem to be a problem in terms of comfort. Overall, I like it.  I would heed the directions to hand wash though. I don't think it would take a tumble in the wash too well.

This does that. It is also made of thicker material, which I appreciate as it helps cause sweating. This particular corset also doesn't dig in when the boning indents as you walk at the waistline. In my experience it doesn't cause as much of a \"muffin top\" between the top of the corset and below the bra. It comes down low enough that it should hopefully help fix the permanent muffin top my jeans and underwear have created. it's comfortable enough to wear for extended periods. The hooks are extremely secure and easy to open and close.\n\nThe only thing to note, is that because this does exactly as I wanted, it does make it to where you can't bend at the waist.

It fit pretty snug at the bottom but the top had a gaping area. I think with more wear I could fit into a smaller size but the lower belly bulge is where I need to focus right now. After a little wear I was able to move the tighter row of clasps.\n\nThis waist trainer was so comfortable that I wore it all day (cleaning house, running errands, etc) for hours and it didn't bother me at all. The fabric was really soft. I don't think it's completely \"invisible\" as mentioned but it's hidden enough that I've worn it under a dress and top and felt it wasn't showing terribly.\n\nI am still getting used to waist training but one thing I love is that it helps with posture when I'm wearing it...like a reminder to sit or stand up straight.\n\nI really noticed a difference when I took off the Waist Trainer after wearing it all day the first time. My tummy was flat and actually felt tighter. I'm looking forward to keeping at this practice for a longer period of time to see just what kind of results can come of this.\n\nThe fabric/style appear to be well made. The boning is well protected and not bothersome in any way. My only complaint is I wish I would have ordered the 1xl instead of the 2xl because of the gaping at the top. I highly recommend you measure your waist before you order and follow the guidelines.\n\nThe clasps are a pain to do/undo but it's much better than a velcro version and you know it's going to hold you in tight as long as you're wearing it.\n\nDisclaimer: I did receive this product to try for free in exchange for an unbiased review.

That should not influence my review of an item.\nFirstly, let me start out by taking a look a the material. The tag that it comes with indicates that it is 75% cotton, 22% Polyester and 3% Spandex. Now, I honestly was expecting a more premium feel where the material is concerned. The shirt feels way too thin. I was expecting something thicker which would indicate that it is better quality. Also, the fact that it does have some amount of spandex, I was expecting it to be even a bit stretchy. I did not notice that either. The color of the material does match the image perfectly and the designs are all in the right places. [I will just have to leave some space here for when I wash it, to see if I lose any color] Overall though, I would give the material a 7/10.\nSecondly, Design and Fit. I won't speak much on the design, everything is where it should be according to the images on the website, so the design is spot on. I ordered an XL because that's what I normally wear. I was however tempted to buy a larger size, out of fear that I t would be a bit too small but It actually fits perfectly. Just the right amount of room in the sleeves. Not too loose and not too tight either. It gracefully and subtly hugs my muscles. So for everyone who's thinking about purchasing this shirt, you can buy your actual size and it will fit. So overall, Design and Fit would get a 10/10 *applause*\nFinally, I'd like to leave a small section called People's reactions: Everyone loves this shirt. I've worn it a couple of times, Mostly to work and the reaction is always positive.\nAll in all, this is a pretty decent buy, you will get the shirt that is in the image and it will fit you as well. The only complaint that I have, is that, for the price tag of $26.99 (for the XL), it does not have a premium feel to it, it's a bit too thin.", "summary": "Beautifully Crafted Shirt", "unixReviewTime": 1471132800}

These shirts \"Emiqude Mens Casual Slim Fit Long Sleeve Pocket Inner Contrast Plaid Dress Shirt\" are perfect for any one who is looking to expand their personal casual wear selection without breaking their bank in the mean time. I have recently purchased several of these shirts and Emiqude has not let me down one bit. I am a 6'1 male weighing about 155 lbs so every time I by a shirt I usually end up wearing something with way too much fabric built into the waist area. These shirts maintain a very slim fit while keeping a very professional, quality cut to the material. I typically wear a medium shirt even tho I have long arms I get a medium and then roll the sleeves up. This shirt was as I expected. The medium fit well in the torso but the sleeves were about an inch too short for my long arms. As for the texture some the shirts have a sheen to them and a real silky feel, others have a more cotton feel to them, but all the shirts have the same tag actually \"75% cotton, 22% polyester, 3% spandex\".  Kinda made me scratch my head a little as to the reason shirts made from obviously different materials were all marked as consisting of the exact same types of material. Regardless they're still great shirts!\n\nI would like to disclose that I have received this product for a discounted rate in exchange for a completely and entirely fair and honest review, however I have not be compelled or given any form of incentive to leave a favorable review, but simply leave my personal thoughts, opinions, and impressions I have made based off of the products own qualities/faults.

So I decided to order me and check it out.  I have been in the retail business and mens formalwear undustry for about 8 years now and I know exactly what my size is.  I typically wear a size 16 shirt 34-35 sleeve and make sure its fitted.  So when I ordered this shirt I figured that a large would be enough to fit.  In tshirt I am usually a size medium and very rarely a size large.  So when I ordered this I figured that a extra large would fit me perfectly.\n\nOnce it arrived it looked like it was going to fit perfectly but upon trying it on the back was still a little tight and the chest if buttoned would pucker up and open up on the front!  I had previously ordered a shirt from a different company but with similar  speck and that shirt fit me extremely tight so I decided to give this one a go.  Partially I can say that its probably my fault for my build.  But I will not deduct more than one star for it still being way too slim fit.\n\nThe cool/weird part of the shirt is the material of the shirt! Its not you typical 100% cotton wrinkle free dress shirt!  This shirt is soft and silky kind of like sheets or polyester shirts.  That didn't bother me too much but gave it a Miami vice aka camp shirt feel to it.\n\nOverall it is a good shirt but I will definitely not button all the buttons up due to fit issues.\n\nClick YES if this review was helpful.

These shirts \"Emiqude Mens Casual Slim Fit Long Sleeve Pocket Contrast Color Solid Dress Shirt\" are perfect for any one who is looking to expand their personal casual wear selection without breaking their bank in the mean time. I have recently purchased several of these shirts and Emiqude has not let me down one bit. I am a 6'1 male weighing about 155 lbs so every time I by a shirt I usually end up wearing something with way too much fabric built into the waist area. These shirts maintain a very slim fit while keeping a very professional, quality cut to the material. I typically wear a medium shirt even tho I have long arms I get a medium and then roll the sleeves up. This shirt was as I expected. The medium fit well in the torso but the sleeves were about an inch too short for my long arms. As for the texture some the shirts have a sheen to them and a real silky feel, others have a more cotton feel to them, but all the shirts have the same tag actually \"75% cotton, 22% polyester, 3% spandex\".  Kinda made me scratch my head a little as to the reason shirts made from obviously different materials were all marked as consisting of the exact same types of material. Regardless they're still great shirts!\n\nI would like to disclose that I have received this product for a discounted rate in exchange for a completely and entirely fair and honest review, however I have not be compelled or given any form of incentive to leave a favorable review, but simply leave my personal thoughts, opinions, and impressions I have made based off of the products own qualities/faults.

I ordered the light blue shirt and was sent the dark blue shirt. It feels nice to the touch and is very comfortable when worn. The shirt is a slim fit and I love how it fits on me. As a tall and skinny person it can be hard to find properly fitting shirts that don't have an absurd amount of material hanging off of it. The sleeves are nice and can be worn like in the pictures provided by the seller with ease. They are kind of tight so they can rest above your elbow easily, which was very nice. The shirt wasn't too hot when worn outside with jeans on either. While wearing it, I noticed that while it fits nicely, some of my movements are restricted, which is sort of expected with this cut of shirt.\n\nThe buttons were a little annoying though. Every time I undid a button it would be snagged on a piece of thread that I would have to cut in order to undo the button. This happened 4 or 5 times, and I don't want to have to cut up a new shirt when I get it.\n\nWhen I got the shirt, I would say it smelled a little like Halloween costumes if that makes any sense to you or is of any value to you haha. Also, if you were wondering, the front pocket is real and isn't just for aesthetics.\n\nI would recommend this shirt to anyone who needs a more formal looking shirt, and Ill likely wear it when going out, or perhaps even at more formal events.\n\nPlease do note, I got this shirt at a discounted price for my honest review.

I chose to go with an extra large with this shirt, but I should have heeded the advice from other reviewers and ordered a size larger. It isn't that the shirt doesn't fit at all. I can wear it and it does look great, but it is tight and I have a feeling after a wash or two it will be so tight the buttons will be popping. Slim fit shirts might be great for ripped guys but if you have a bit of a dad bod - a thin build with a beer belly - you really need a larger size, and that's what I should have gone with.\n\nBut I cannot fault the shirt or then company for my mistake. Like I said, the shirt looks great. My girlfriend picked it out for me and encouraged me to purchase it and she loves it on me. The shirt is well made with good material and is very stylish.

It's kind of awkward and doesn't look super flattering unless you wear a belt, but I feel like that's pretty standard with most rompers.  I wore this with a thick belt and it fixed the awkwardness just beautifully\n\n***Please note that I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

In terms of measurements, it fit as as expected as I ordered the medium and it fit me great in every place. If its any help, I currently weigh 123 lbs and my height is 5'2ft. I have a 36 C cup and the medium size was quite accurate for my measurements. The bottom part was perfect while the top part was great as I managed to use the middle part to adjust my breast between it. As a curvy woman, this is a indeed a hit! The top part is ideal for us who have a medium to larger chest size. It is also very comfortable to wear and of durable high quality lacy materials. My only suggestion would be to wear it carefully as you can't just slip it on. Its adjustable but you have to take you're time while wearing it but otherwise its a great fit as mentioned before. It is also soft and gentle as the lacy material is quite smooth. Overall, I truly like it a lot and I am glad that I purchased it at a discount in exchange for my honest and fair review as it a charm to wear.

The ear rings match up perfectly and are the length that she likes. Everything fits perfectly now that the little adjustment was made.\nI received this product at a reduced price in order to do an unbiased and honest evaluation which this is.

My daughter actually is on the smaller side, and is 18 months. I ordered the 2-3 size and it fits her perfectly, although the top is a little big. The design on the bottoms is so stinking cute. There seems to be a little ruffling design that makes this suit seem very boutique style. The colors are vibrant and in person, the metallic is very shimmery.

I can't believe anyone would let a little girl wear something like that out in public.\nI am very very disappointed in this suit. I can't even post pictures with how small it is, its so inappropriate.

I purchased this for my little girl which I would normally would not do. The suit seems appropriate enough for her she is six and a half years old. I normally buy her tankini's or a suit with shorts for bottoms because she is young and because of the sun and protection. My daughter is very petite and has a tiny waist and long legs. She normally wears a 6x for length but her waist can fit a 4t/5t.\n\nThe bottoms of the bathing suit are a bit baggy on her bottom. She has some room to grow in the top which is fine, I'm hoping she can wear it year round or through next summer. I purchased this in a XL according to her age.  I do love that the waist of the bottoms are rusched and cover her belly. The scales and the color are bright and fabulous. The swim suit is great quality, better than I expected. The top is adorable and a bright beautiful purple with a big purple bow. It ties around the neck. Her chest and back have good coverage with the suit. I definitely think she will be able to fit in this next summer as well because she is so petite (hoping the material lasts that long from wear and tear).  She loves her mermaid swim suit and she wants a matching fin skirt to match. I really wish this came with shorts or a skirt to match and lounge around it, it would really tie the suit together.\n\nI would definitely buy this suit again for her.

Unfortunately, this shirt I am not so thrilled.  I gave it 3 stars for the following reasons. I dislike the color scheme on it. I was hesitant about the colors when I was contemplating buying it. It looked like it had pink on it, but I was not sure.  I do not like dressing my grandson in  pink or purple. However, if there was any pink, it looked like it was just a tiny splash. Wrong! It is not just the pink, it is the entire color scheme. It is hard to tell from the pictures. But the shirt has lots of pink, teal. As far as the construction of the shirt, it appears to be made well. All of the stitching is even, no loose strings, etc. The material is a little thick, but it feels cheap. I think because of the graphic design. I read one review that stated it faded immediately after it was washed. Looking at this shirt, I was concerned it would fade as well. I have had custom shirts made for my grandson before that had graphic designs. One store owner said do NOT wash shirts with graphic designs with any type of baby detergent. That baby detergents contain a lot of stain removers and can cause fading. So I washed this shirt in the sink with regular detergent and hung it to dry. Another reason I am not happy with this shirt. Who has time to hand wash a baby's or child's play shirt? (Except a grandparent, like me). It is just not practical. Lastly, the biggest problem I have with this shirt is the only care label I found was written in Chinese. Which is great for people living in China. But I live in America. I do NOT know how to read Chinese! I purchased this shirt at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. Which I think you can tell is unbiased. I would have given the shirt 2 stars and returned it if I had to pay full price. As I stated at the beginning of this review, until now, I have been extremely pleased with my purchases from Fiream. This particular shirt does not meet my standards.", "summary": "It feels cheap!", "unixReviewTime": 1465862400}

And the pics people posted are to the tee...  I would highly suggest purchasing it.  Great party dress/cocktail dress!

It is very slim and easy to carry, it slips in your pocket and you forget that it is even there. At the same time it still has enough storage options to carry most anything you would need unless you are just one of those people who crams everything in their wallet and use it as long term storage.\n\nThe design is perfect for me.  I carry my work ID in the windowed slot for easy identification, along with my drivers license in the second slot. The opposite side carries payment options (debit and credit card). Behind the card sets I keep a blank check on one side and my health insurance card on the other. That leaves the main center pocket for cash and that's all I need.\n\nMy only complaint with this item would be the leather. It is not the highest quality leather and the color just looks bad in my opinion. To be fair, the color is exactly how it appears in the photos, it is just too orange/red looking for me and I think it makes it look cheap. But, I will still be using it as my daily carry. Function over form.\n\nThe RFID shield is a great addition but not why I purchased this. Honestly, it's not something I am concerned with so I just view it as a bonus. I have no way to test it's functionality though, so I can only trust that it works as advertised.\n\nI have not had this product for very long so I am not able to speak to the durability of it in terms of longevity. It seems well constructed as far as I can tell. However, if I have any problems with that in the future, I will be sure to post an update to this review with any relevant photographs.\n\nThis is a good product and I would recommend it.\nIf you considered this review helpful, please mark it as such below so that other people will be able to find it more easily.\n\nI did receive it a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review, but that in no way sways my review. If a product is bad, then I will tell you; and if my opinion changes with more use I will edit my review. I know how much I depend on these reviews when I am purchasing products for myself, and I work hard to give accurate and helpful advice anytime I review a product. I say all that because I have to in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission 16 CFR Part 255: Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsement and Testimonials in Advertising, not because it sways my review in any way.\n\nI hope you enjoy this product should you decide to get it.

The length of the small with a little heel is perfect. It has a belt which takes care of any oversize in that area without any indication of it being oversized.  It is not skin tight, which I am happy about but not at all baggy either. The top was a little big and I put a few stitches under the arms and it is perfect. I was willing to alter a bit, it took 10 minutes to do, rather than return due to the very reasonable price and that I loved it compared to others I had tried.\n\nAlso, it says black and white Aztec.

Plus, inside there are three additional compartments  one closed with zip and two slip pockets, one larger and the other enough sized for wallet or phone to fit in.\n\nOn the bag outside there are three additional pockets - one on the front closed with magnet, and two more, one on each side, also closed with magnets. All of the outside pockets are easily accessible making them a perfect storage for the things that are frequently taken out or put in bag. Both side pockets are a bit smaller, yet provide enough space to put inside 0.3l bottle for example, while the front pocket is somewhat bigger enable storing of larger smartphones or even tablet.\n\nThis is the first casual Bag I received at cheaper price for review purpose and I am very happy using it. In short time it became bag that I take with me when I am going outside with my friends because of its look and weight. Therefore my expectations are fulfilled and I can recommend this Retro Rucksack big time.\n\nThis Unisex Retro Rucksack was received at a discounted price for the purpose of testing and unbiased review, while all the presented information is based on my impressions.", "summary": "Casual Retro Rucksack", "unixReviewTime": 1461024000}

I am 5'2\" and a size 4/6 in a dress this style. I followed the guide and bought a medium, which fit well except it is significantly shorter than I expected.

However the dress is actually 37\" long and just comes to the top of my knee. I know that is how it looks on the model, and what other taller reviews reported, but given my short height and the claim that it is 41\" long, I ordered it. I am returning it.

Best of all no tags whatsoever, tags can get so itchy and annoying to little ones, so glad. It came nicely presented and overall it's just like that company mudpie. They too make cute stitched on products but, Phoebe Cat is actually affordable unlike there overpriced brand! I wouldn't hesitate for a second to buy from them again. I tried to get my 2 1/2y old to model it but he was in defiant not going to happen mode so I took them while he laid down.\n\n**Please Note: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review** I was not paid in anyway and in fact rely on reviews before I purchase anything on Amazon.

As we tried it on him, it fitted him perfectly and he gave us a happy smile afterwards.  Couple of hours passed by and we did not see any sign of discomfort on his part which means that he is very much comfortable in wearing these outfits.  He looked so cute in it.  My wife liked it too!  The shorts is also nice.  It is not too tight on his waistline which is good because there should be room for his bulky diaper.  We already washed and dried these on the machines and they came out just like new.  There were no wearing or tearing and there was not any fading of colors as well.

Upon trying it on again, it did fit and is actually one of my favorite tops now. (Putting in the laces made all the difference in how it laid and fit.) The fit is just like the picture shows. I have washed the shirt one time in cold water and let it air dry flat. Some of the unfinished seams (like the ones inside the pockets, for example) have some fraying, but nothing terrible. It does feel like it shrunk a little bit, even though I used cold water and gently stretched it as it dried. I'm going to avoid machine washing as much as I can and would absolutely not put it in the dryer.\n\nOriginal: This top runs slightly small. I typically wear a large for flowy shirts like this and this large did not fit across my chest (41\"), even without the laces put in yet. Otherwise, the rest of the shirt (arms, waist, length, etc) seemed proportional and fit well.\nThe fabric does not feel cheap, but seems like it would be difficult to wash.

I got the strawberry outfit in the 2 Year size for my 18 month old who is currently wearing a 2T and this fit perfectly.

The colors are very vivid and very attractive, and the little strawberries have the cutest little faces on some of them. The \"vest\" is a tank top, just in case you were wondering, and the shorts are very nicely made. The elastic band in the shorts is very wide and seems really heavy duty, so I'm hopeful that it will hold up in the long term. The seams in both pieces are well done with no loose threads or crooked sections that I could see.\n\nI actually really like that the shorts are longer than most little girl's shorts as I think they need to be kids and not be put in short shorts from early on. So I would steer clear of these if the though of somewhat longer shorts on your little girl would bother you. You wouldn't like these. These shorts came down to my little girl's knee, and the whole outfit looked and fit her like it would be very comfortable for her. Very nicely done! I'm very happy with this outfit!!\n\nMy only suggestion would be to add some sort of embellishment to make it stand out a little bit more. A little contrasting pocket, or a small flower in a pretty color. Something along those lines. This could easily be dressed up if you were handy and wanted to add the pocket or a flower or something around the neckline or whatever. And these would be great if used as separates for other cute pieces.

We found it difficult to judge how tight to tie it around the neck to keep the shells up without it tied around her back but then found it hard to tie it nicely around her back when it wasn't tied around her neck.  It took some tying and untying before we got it just right and even then it seemed like it didn't cover as much as my daughter would have liked.  The shorts idea was awesome.  She could wear those when she got tired of swimming with the fin.  The fin did make it more difficult to swim but she did have fun for a while.  We have decided that the swim suit is only to be worn in the home pool since it is a bit lose and revealing at times.

I searched for a long time, and this is the one! I'm a size 12-14 and I ordered the 14-16 and it fits very well. A little extra room in the boobs, I'm a B, but it's padded well and looks natural. It feels a little longer on the hips than a normal suit, which I like, retro style, it's super flattering on my bulky hips and not tight. The butt part covers ok, a lil booty still peeks out, but it's ok. It is not too tight where it's squeezing at my back or thighs or buff, it's comfortably fitting. The color is beautiful. I love the purple color, it's better that I thought. The halter ties could be a little longer, but it works. The lines/extra fabric in the belly is very flattering and with a little adjustment, looks really cute. It is made of good, strong material, good quality. This is the right suit for me, I hope it works for you. I love it!! I feel so confident and comfortable wearing it. Great suit!", "summary": "Great suit! So happy!", "unixReviewTime": 1465344000}

This top comes in a host of colors, but I got the nice navy blue one. The color is rich and deep, and when I receive it, it was wrapped in plastic to ensure freshness and newness.\n\nThe top is made with thick rayon with 5% spandex for stretch. I love natural fabrics and this is definitely soft and quality. Rayon also doesnt really wrinkle that much and washes PERFECTLY! When I first washed this top  it came out looking like new. There was NO shrinking, fading or tearing! This makes this type of top ideal for traveling since you can throw it in your suitcase and it comes out looking great!\n\nThe top has a lot of style. The sides hang down and give an elongated look. The front is also fairly long, I have a long stomach and sometimes shirts are short on me. I am 58 and this hangs down long enough. Also I got the XXL. It fits a size 14-16 perfectly. However, if you are 12-14 I would recommend getting the XL because I am losing weight and can tell this shirt will be soon too large. I will have to purchase another color in the XL!\n\nThe top sleeves are flirty and feminine and the neckline has elastic. This is because the top is designed to hang off shoulder. There is a drawstring on the neck line. This is great because it allows for the shirt to be as modest or sexy as you want. You can pull it down and create more cleavage for nights out. This is a great top and I recommend it to anyone looking for cute warm weather clothing! 5/5 stars\n\nIf you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a discounted promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "This top is perfect for the upcoming hot weather", "unixReviewTime": 1459641600}

It came in a plastic packaging (see photo) and came out wrinkled, but nothing that can't be undone with ironing or heat drying. The neckline measures 17.75\" and the bustline was around 36.25\". It did not shrink after washing. The fabric is light, almost like lawn cotton, breathable, and comfortable. Perfect for spring or summer. No stitches were out of place and I like that. If it were a better quality cotton, I'd give it 5 stars. But for the price it is a great buy and value. It shipped fast too.\n\nThe wrist ties provide versatile styling depending on how loosely or tightly these are knotted. As I am petite, the sleeves reach the top of my wrists, but if I knot the ties tightly, the sleeves can be 3/4 length. This top goes perfectly well with jeans and pants, tucked and untucked, and with both flats and heels. Its hemline is certainly cut high to the sides as the other reviewers said (see photo). I don't particularly mind this though. I also like it that chest portion of the neckline does not have elastic in them. The elastic starts on both shoulders and runs to the back. Unlike other off-the-shoulder tops, this one does not ride up my shoulders.

I absolutely love them and how they fit! I ordered these quite large so my daughter would be able to wear them for a while, and here are the pros and cons of the pair we got!\n\nPros:\n\n1) I love the doggie on the front! It is a really nice applique and it seems to be applied to the fabric well. It is so stinking cute and it looks exactly like the picture so that is awesome! I have no concerns that this will come off or have issues with fraying around the edges, etc. Seems to be good quality and we have washed these PJs a few times already!\n\n2) the material is thick! I like this as we have a kiddo who refuses to use blankets. It is a nice summer pj for kids who won't use blankets and yet still get a little chilly because we run AC all summer. This would be something to note if you generally do not use AC and are looking for a very lightweight fabric, though.\n\n3) fit as expected. this is sizing that runs as expected, and I like that. Often times you order something online and it shows up and is either huge or TINY. Not this one - it is pretty dead on with sizing in the stores. and the seams and stitching seems to be well done with no visible errors or issues!\n\nCons:\n\n1) the only con for me is that the dots are not the fabric coloring/paint, but rather like little iron on dots. So far they are holding up ok and this is not really an issue. I do not know if they will continue to hold up through multiple washes, but so far, so good! It is something to note, though if you are not into iron on things.!\n\nNote: I received this product at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review.", "summary": "cute doggy pjs!", "unixReviewTime": 1466035200}

It's really cute. I bought it for my granddaughter, who looks adorable in just about everything:) She'll be three in July and is on the small side. Usually wears cloths close to her age in size. Right now, she's in size 3T, but is still in pull ups, so I imagine the sizing will stay the same for a while once she's in underpants. I read through the reviews before ordering. Having ordered things for myself that were made in China, I usually go up in size or two. Thought these would be great as summer pajamas, or even to wear to preschool, to have extra outfit(s.)\n\nWe were babysitting last night, so I had an opportunity to hold it up to her. I had ordered a size 4/5, because I thought these would run small. The package had a size 5 on it, so I was leery about it size wise for this year. I was right. It was way too big for her right now. A 3/4 would have been right for this summer. Good news is that it should be great for next summer. DIL doesn't mind having a stock of next sizes, so it will work out well. It's so cute, I'm thinking of buying her some of the 3/4s for this summer.\n\nI did receive a discount on this product with the expectation that I provide an honest review.

She loves animals- especially kittens and doggies. As soon as the package came in I let her open it and as soon as she saw it she screamed with joy and said- Mommy, Mommy can I try it, can I have it, this is mine!!  I was impressed as well, these really did look sweet and super adorable! The pajamas have a short sleeve/pant, crew neck; they are pink with a cute doggie pattern embroidered on the shirt along with white and orange polka dots on the sleeves and pants. It's a semi thick patch, but it is lined in the back with white delicate fabric to add comfort. Pjs are made of 100% cotton, and seem and feel to be of descent quality and are quite cozy and comfy. Upon inspecting the pjs closely there appeared to be no lose threads or uneven stitching- they are well made.\n\nAs far as sizing goes, I think you definitely need to buy at least a size up, depending how big your daughter is. My daughter is 2  yrs old, but she is big (tall) for her age, she currently wears 4T, rarely 3T, so I got this set for her in size 4T (3-4 age) and it fits great. Its definitely not too lose for my liking, but definitely not tight at all, so hopefully she can wear it next year as well.although I do have an issue with the elastic waistband, its definitely on a tighter side, and she is tall and skinny so it fits her well, a bit too tight actually for my preference. Therefore if your girl is a little thicker or even average it might be a little too tight for her, hence I will probably need to cut it next year, but for now its fine.\n\nI really do like the length of the pjs, the shorts fall just a little below her knees and the top falls way past the top of the shorts. Overall the pjs are super cute and they can be multi functional because they can be worn as not only pjs but an outfit too! And yes they are machine washable, I have washed them few times on delicate cycle and they haven't faded or shrunk. However, I did notice in one place in where the decal is stitched around the borders in one spot the embroidery is getting undone/ripping away just a little, I really do hope its just that one spot and that the whole appliqu won't start to rip. I will update this review should the quality worsen, for now I will give it 4 stars because nonetheless I really do like them and my daughter just loves them and they are just so endearing.

I love everything from the vivid pink color to the coordinating polka dots to the puppy appliqu. The fabric is a very soft cotton. It is lightweight enough for our Florida weather but heavy enough to hold its shape well. The entire garment is well stitched with no loose threads, and the elastic waistband is not scratchy at all.

The dog has red heart shaped bows on her ears and a green shirt with a red heart on it. There is a little tag sewn onto the side of the shirt that says \"baby\". The sleeves are a pink polka dotted fabric. It's the same fabric used in the shorts. The shorts have an elastic waistband and it's not adjustable. There is ribbing sewn to the bottom of the sleeves and on the bottom of the shorts. That might bother some kids. I know when I was a kid, but I hated ribbing on the edges of my clothes. It made the clothes feel tight. Both pieces are made from 100% cotton so it might shrink a little.

She typically wears 5T-6T in clothes, but I purchased a size 7 for this pajama set, so she'd have room to grow in them.  I also wanted them to be slightly loose so she'd be comfortable during sleep.  These fit my daughter just as expected - slightly large, but perfect for sleep!  The top is long and narrow - perfect for my tall thin daughter's body type.  The shorts have a fitted elastic waist and are a bit loose around the thighs, with a slightly fitted bottom hem.  These look adorable on my daughter!\n\nThese are made of 100% cotton and after a wash and dry, they are super comfortable.  It is recommended to wash these inside out in warm water and dry on low heat.  I'm sure that's to preserve the detailed puppy design.\n\nThese pajamas are nice and lightweight, which is great for my little girl who tends to heat easily when she sleeps.\n\nWe love that these are tag less, adding to the comfort of these pjs!\n\nMy kiddo loves dogs, polka dots and the color pink, so when she saw these there was lots of screaming and jumping up and down. I'd say she approves! These are by far the one pair of pajamas she asks to wear to bed every night!\n\nI was fortunate to have received this product at a discounted price.

Please bare with me as I want to tell you a story. I ordered this shirt on March 25, 2016. It came in the mail a few days ago. When I opened it I was startled by the material, I had no idea what it was because it didn't look like anything I'd ordered. I put it in my review queue and didn't think anything else about it.\n\nI was browsing Facebook tonight when I got one of those \"PEOPLE ALSO SHARED\" recommendations after I read an irrelevant Buzzfeed story. It suggested that I read an article titled, \"Say No To The Dress.\" The article had an image next to it that provoked a memory, I thought, \"That's the shirt I ordered on Amazon!\" The TLDR is the Buzzfeed article discusses counterfeit items being sold on Facebook. I've known of this practice and prided myself in sniffing out a scam.\n\nAfter reading the article I come back to Amazon a dig through my orders to find the shirt in question. At this point, I'm convinced it was that shirt I received that I didn't recall ordering. It looked exactly like the Buzzfeed image except mine was black and not gray. It didn't take long and here am at this listing looking at the same model in a shirt that looks nothing like what I ordered.\n\nAt this point, I'm offended and feel used. I feel like someone expected us reviewers to give them a good reputation for their counterfeit product. Had I not stumbled on to this article I still would have questioned their authenticity. I would have let people know that this is not a cotton T-shirt like the one the model is wearing. Then I would have reviewed it based on the quality of what I received. I would never have expected that I was being used to support a counterfeit operation.\n\nIf this product were listed for what it actually is I would have recommended it. It's not a terrible shirt. The listing is deceptive but more importantly they are taking advantage of reviewers like myself to build a reputation they don't deserve.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this review. If you have any questions about my experience please leave me a comment. I will be happy to follow up on my experience with this product.\n\nI received this product complimentary from Yiyou for quality testing purposes; all opinions expressed are my own.", "summary": "Beware of counterfeit items.", "unixReviewTime": 1460332800}

Makes me feel a little more secure.\n\nNormally I hate swim season because I am uncomfortable in a bathing suit. But I'm actually looking forward to it this year!  I feel like I look cute and sexy in this suit!\n\nI received this bathing suit at a reduced price in exchange for my honest review.", "summary": "Cute and comfy swimsuit!", "unixReviewTime": 1462924800}

I want to go to the gym and sit in the spa at the end.  I picked these 3 items because I don't want to shave my private part every time when I want to put on the swim suit.  These 3 swim suits all does a great job covering the bikini area.  Two of them are 2 piece design and one is one piece design.\n\nMy size, normally I wear size 8 petite for bottom and large for top. Bust size: 38\" widest, wear 34C and 36C Victoria secret full coverage only, may need a bigger size if not full coverage.  Waist: 30\", butt: 36\"; height: 5 ft 4\".  I can put all of them on without any problem.  I am returning 2 and keeping the one that is most comfortable.\n\nSize information for B01D8K7HOA: I ordered size 10 as more people think it's bigger than expected than smaller than expected.\n- Straps are adjustable from 9\" to 16\"\n- Bust: is 30\" measure flat, removable bra circle is 5\" diameter\n- Waist: as this is a 2 piece design, these is not really waist area, the part after the bra goes from 30\" to 36\" wide.\n- Bottom: boy short 26\" flat and you can stretch it out to 32\"\n- From the top to bottom, it measures 18\"\n\nFeedback:\n- I like the boy short, but  I like this one the least.  Although the bra padding can be removed, this is the most basic kind that I don't like.  It is not designed for someone with huge top as there is no wire support like the other 2. I don't like the back (halter), I have a hard time to tight it.  The position is too high and the fabric is too smooth and it keeps sliding away from my finger tips.  I would rate this 75/100 compared to the other 2.\n///\n\nSize information for B01H59GO1W: purchased size L based on size chart: 38.5-40\" chest\n- Waist is around 28\"\n- When lay flat without stretching, the bust area measure 32\" (without counting the curve of the cups)\n- From top (where the bust area) to bottom of the skirt measure 20\"\n\nFeatures that I like:\n- Adjustable shoulder straps, you can change it from 7\" and extend to whole length of 14\", I find the strap slightly uncomfortable\n- supportable wired cup\n- Removable padding, you can remove it if it does not fit you.  I find the padding slightly bigger than the available area.  It is difficult to pull it out, and flatten it out and have it turns and faces the right way after I try to put it back in.\n\nFeedback:\nOne piece design: depends on your height, you may find it better to buy 2 pieces if you are much taller than me or you wear different sizes of bottom. I think this is perfect for someone who does not have huge tops.  If you have more than C cup, you may not like this one.  It maybe good for someone who is between 5 feet to 5 feet 7 based on the length and the shoulder strap. I do look slimmer in it, especially the waist area based on the design.  As I am not that tall, although it fits me (not too tight, not too loose), I look \"wide\" in it based on the proportion of the dress and my body shape. I am returning it as I feel the cup padding area is smaller than my actual chest, and I rate this as 85/100 based on its quality and comfort.\n///\n\nSize information for B01GX3BT9I size 12, I ordered this size based on my bust.\n- Strap is not adjustable, it measures 14\". As it is wider than B01H59GO1W, I find the strap more comfortable.\n- Bust: is 28\" measure flat, meaning, this one come with big curve bra and wired cup, and I can not measure all the curves.  I only measure from the back in a straight line.\n- Waist: as this is a 2 piece design, these is not really waist area, the dress is 36\" wide after the bra cups.\n- Bottom: straight is 30\" but you can stretch it out to 36\"\n- From top to bottom, it measures around 25\".\n\nFeatures that I like:\nFlexible 2 piece design is great if you need a smaller or bigger bottom.  What I like the most is the bra and built in wired.  It is really comfortable.  Before I tried it on, I was thinking, the bra looks way too big for me.  Actually, it gives great support.  However, this built in support / wired bra cannot be removed.\n\nFinal thought: The layering (cross over) of fabric in the front is a little bit strange, where my finger is pointing.  What I don't like about it, I am kind of chubby, so with that said, this dress does show some meat piling up below the bra area, and above the waist area on the sides.  Depends on how much meat you have on your body and your back, they may be squeezed into layers. It is good for someone want excellent support for their big headlights.  This is the one that I am keeping, I rate this 90/100.\n\nI purchased this product at a reduced price to complete and post a factual review without compensation.

It has ties on the side that can be pulled tighter to bring the sides up a bit and accommodate most shapes to what makes you feel the most comfortable. The straps are great too as they have slides just like a bra so you can tighten the top and keep your girls from flopping around. I'm very large chested,  38 G, and fit fine in the top since I can adjust it. Smaller chests would be fine too since there is another tie between the breasts that can be pulled and tightened.\nOverall, I'm super happy with the fit and style and happy with my purchase.

The snaps have 3 levels to be able to adjust sizing as you lose or gain weight. The straps are adjustable as well. I ordered a little small so that I would have to squeeze in and get maximum benefit. I will only be wearing mine at home and to sleep in, but if you plan to wear yours all the time I would suggest using the sizing chart so as not to be too uncomfortable. I am very curvy and have hips and a large butt so waist trainers always bunch up on my back and hips. That's the only reason i won't wear mine throughout the day, because it makes my clothing lumpy. But if you aren't curvy you should be fine. I have tried several trainers before and I like this one best so far because of the straps. I got this at a discount in exchange for a review. If you have any questions please feel free to ask. Oh, in my experience, if you will be wearing your trainer for many hours a day I would order 2-3, so that you have one to wear while one is being washed.", "summary": "It's a nice thick waist trainer that has straps to hold the ...", "unixReviewTime": 1468713600}

I had never used a belt like this before, but when it arrived  I had no trouble putting it on. When I tried to take it off, however, I couldn't figure out how to use the lever underneath the belt buckle to release the catch. I push. I pulled. I lifted (apparently not far enough). My wife did the same, without any more success than I had. I finally got so frustrated I headed for the kitchen to get a knife to cut the belt off. Luckily, on the way, I got so angry I power-jerked the belt off. When I cooled down, I experimented with it until I found that if I pushed the lever up AS FAR AS I COULD PUSH IT, the catch released and I could back the belt out of the teeth that holds it in place. West: For those people like me who are all thumbs, please provide a diagram showing (1) how to push the belt through the buckle to cinch it up, and (2) how to release the catch. It doesn't even have to have words--just a simple diagram will do. Now that I've figured out the system, I'll likely get a brown belt to go with my black one. I like the all-leather, supple belt that I bought, and I like the buckling system--now that I know how to work it. By the way, I had to get a belt two sizes larger than my normal belt size because that was the smallest offered.

I would take one star off for that, except that when I saw the belt that I ordered for my husband, it was such an expensive looking belt, it came in this brown box that would be great to give as a gift.  He loved the way it looked and tried it on right away.  He's in the process of losing weight too, and this was a size 38, which he thought would be too big for him but it was actually fairly small, so if ordering, I would order a size up.  The belt buckle was very nice and the belt itself is made of very good quality leather.  It looks very expensive and he loves to wear it with all his clothes now.

My opinion.....  I like the offset of the black and the rose gold.  However, the rose color is not true to other items so its off if you use a rose gold case.  It is more of a gold/copper.  I think a copper case would match better but I bought a gold TPU case that seems to match about 80% (you judge).  At a glance I don't think you can really tell between the gold case and the band.  I personally think in a casual setting with walking around it goes pretty much unnoticed.  The links have a slight discoloration in the bends but again - not too noticeable unless you (or your other) might be OCD.  My pics aren't the best but hopefully it gives you a comparison of the gold TPU case against the rose coloring.

The bra is a nice speckled dark gray with almost black mesh and gray/green swooshes on the back with a OUDIKE logo on the front. I got the medium and its nearly perfect for a 34B. The padding actually works well in this bra and has a built in curvature that maintains a nice almost full look even with the compression you would expect from a sport bra.  Its more important than it normally would be with the mesh cutout in the front so unlike most bras in general the padding gets to stay in.  The mesh cut out is very cute and sexy and the mesh area in the back is very comfortable and both make it breathe very well.  The elastic is very comfortable and it offers great support to keep everything where it should be and it looks great. I was concerned about the fit based on some of the reviews but it seemed to be exactly the size I thought it would be so I did a good job ordering this time. If you are looking for something a bit more attractive than the average sports bra that offers good coverage and support but still looks a little fun and flirty then this is a good fit.

Easily giftable as a gift. The belt comes wrapped in plastic and the buckle is wrapped as well in a plastic cover. The length of the belt is sufficient and can add holes by yourself if you need to adjust the number of holes since the belt easily fits medium sized bodies.\n\nTo begin with, the belt I received as seen in the picture is not the same as what I received as seen in the pictures. So my review only covers this belt. The belt as a silver buckle instead of the picture gold. I will update this review if I am able to get the correct product. There is no gold accent where you insert the belt but is black. This is a standard belt which allows you to insert the belt into the buckle using the holder. Then, use the sizer to size your size by inserting the needle into the appropriate hole.\n\nThe belt is of solid quality and the buckle is ok. The holder in which you place the nonbuckle side through is held together by a metal clasp. I think that this is a flaw and can break off after reasonable use. Not sure if that is waterproof for this as well.\n\nOverall, the quality of the belt is of high quality but the belt holder is questionable and the fact I received the wrong product prevents me from giving this item 5 stars.\n\nI have received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review for the product.

I am a slim, petite woman who has the toughest time finding a good belt anywhere.  I find the belt selections in the store to always be way to large - unless I go into the kids section. I can pretty much forget about ever finding anything to try on so I am left to order belts online, which is typically a 50/50 shot. Its so frustrating.  Belts on me typically end up being way too long (even in the smallest size) or too wide so that I can't fit the belt through the loops of petite pants or if they fit, the holes do not end up being available so I have to use a hole punch to make holes that fit my waist.  Its been a frustration almost my entire adult life. I opened the mailing package and inside was an unexpected presentation box.  It was perfectly ready to give as a gift right there.  I then opened the box and the belt was inside of a cotton bag. Wow!  What a very nice \"surprise and delight\" before I even got my hands on the product.  The box was a chocolate brown and the bag inside was a lighter brown. Great styling in the packaging alone so I couldn't wait to see the belt.  I opened the bag and the belt was rolled up and it came inside of plastic protective covering.  The belt buckle had its own sturdier plastic.  This belt was shipped carefully and well protected.  I removed the belt and the leather smell was intoxicating.  It is such a beautifully styled product.  It is braided leather, which is PERFECT for me.  I don't ever have to worry about punch holes - the entire belt has holes.  It fit through the belt loops perfectly, as well.  I put it on and it secured nice and tight.  The loose end was not too long (which is normally the case on me). I honestly cannot believe that I found the perfect belt when I wasn't even looking.  I bought the black leather option.  Its an even color, high quality leather, and the buckle is not gaudy gold, its a very light colored tint which is the perfect compliment.  Overall I highly recommend this product, especially if you have issues with size.  This one is great for larger waists and hips as well as smaller.  With this many holes there is not anyone this belt will not fit.  I then I can't believe the price.  The quality for price is outstanding. I will most definitely be ordering it in brown at full price now.  I would buy this one belt over and over to use as my standard go-to.  There is no doubt.  Out of all of the products I have tested so far, this is by far the most useful for me and has me the most excited.  Never thought a belt would do that, but if you have trouble finding belts that fit BUY BUY BUY this product.  You will not be sorry about that choice.  Note that I received this item from the seller at a discount in exchange for an honest review.  My reviews are purely my opinion and are not influenced at all by the seller or the discount I received. If you believe my review has helped you, feel free to mark that it has been useful.", "summary": "This belt is a MUST BUY for all size waists.

There are plenty of card slots where I keep my most used cards - and places underneath those slots where I can store other things that are less often used, but needed. I do like having two separate compartments in the money (bill) area, as my previous wallet had that and I found that I could easily separate my dollar bills from other papers and such that I might need to keep in my billfold.\n\nI really don't have any way to test the effectiveness of the RFID blocking other than to take the manufacturers word that it does. I guess I could take an RFID tag off of an item in a store and put it in my wallet and see if I could get out the door, but I don't want to end up in jail ;-).

I was very much impressed with the presentation of this wallet when I received this on hand.  Not only did the presentation impress me but as well as its high quality.  The leather that has been used as material for this is truly a good one.  I like the texture of this wallet as well as its color.  I like how black it is.  This will always looked like brand new even in the passing of time, which is really nice as I do not like the old of an old wallet.  I like this as it is slim even though I have already put all of my stuff in there, it does not look and feel bulky or heavy at all.  I also liked that it has enough slots and compartments to accommodate all of my credit cards and other important identification cards.  This wallet really holds everything that I want in for a wallet.  The compartment that is transparent is perfectly right for my driver's license which made it so convenient for showing my ID without it taking it out of my wallet.  The slots are also nice as they can very much keep your cards intact and safe.  They are not too tight nor loose, thus there is an ease of putting in your cards as well as taking them out.  Another very nice feature of this thing is its RFID feature.  I am more on the preventive stuff so I am so happy that this will protect me from being a possible victim of identity theft.  Nowadays, we really have to be more cautious about it.  Overall, this was such a very nice gift for myself and a very worthy purchase of my money.\nI was able to get this very nice item on a discount and I am glad to share to you all as well my fair and honest feedback about it.  My review on this product was based on my experienced with it through testing it or using it after receiving it.", "summary": "Very nice quality wallet", "unixReviewTime": 1465948800}

It is well manufactured, it definitely won't fall apart. I must admit, that I have seen similar wallets that appeared of a slightly better quality than this one, but they were much more expensive.

At the crease, the printed pattern is screwed up and doesn't look good. This goes all the way up the sides.

I purchased the size medium/large. I am a size 9 foot and it works perfectly for me. These are substantial socks and go up the leg a ways and keep me nice and warm. They are high quality, not like the cheap types you get at Target or Wal-Mart. I think if you are less than a size 8 foot, I would recommend getting a small/medium size. These are designed for both male and female feet so the sizing is unisex.\n\nThe fabric on these is tight weave screen printed cotton. It says on the front of the sock card hand linked toe so the toe is incredibly sturdy and your feet won't be going through it anytime soon. The screen printing on these is BEAUTIFUL. It is VERY vivid and bright. The color is rich, true, and there are no spotty places the ink didn't print. It is full 360 printing. The wash instructions recommend Cold water, line dry I would imagine over time if you just throw these in the regular wash they may fade from the ink of the printing. However, if you heed the wash instructions these will stay nice for years to come.\n\nThe popsicles are neon yellow, pink and chocolate on top with sprinkles. They have wooden sticks. The background is black. The tops have elastic banding that keep these secure up your leg and they don't fall down or start to bunch up. There is a little insignia of the companys name Fools Day on the upper elastic banding. They are ULTRA soft and highly comfortable for all day wear. I really recommend these and want to get some other prints! They are SO FUN! 5/5 stars\n\nIf you have any questions please post below and I would be happy to answer! I received a discounted promotional sample of this item for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "SO FUN!", "unixReviewTime": 1460851200}

I also have gigantic boobs. This makes it very difficult to find a bathing suit that fits (I'm for reference, I'm 5'10\" and a size 4/6 with a 30F bra size) but doesn't show my tummy and upper thighs. I've tried a lot of swim dresses and they never seemed long enough to cover the very tops of my thighs and the chest was almost always too small. I can deal with that as long as it supports the girls, but because I am so tall, the bust is usually pretty low. I can't find two piece bottoms that either are high enough to conceal the worst of my loose skin or that cover my upper thighs (I can get one but not both).\nI tell you all of this so you can understand that I have searched high and low for a swimsuit I feel comfortable in.\nThis suit is awesome. First of all, it is long enough to cover my upper thighs, which are thick, without digging into them. It's not so long that it looks prudish. The body of the suit is very comfortable. The halter brings the cups high enough to provide great support. My chest doesn't QUITE fit, but it's close enough. I would guess that someone with a larger band size and a D or even a large C would fit better. You definitely do need boobs, though. It won't work for small chested women.\nI wear a 4/6 in pants and bought this in a 6/8, since swimsuits tend to run small. The suit was very comfortable and plenty roomy so I would say that someone who is a 6/8 could wear it comfortably.\nOne thing to note is that the body is pretty long. I don't think this suit will work for short women. I am 5'10\" and this probably had an inch or two more length in the torso than even I needed.\nBottom line, though? This is the first suit I have ever felt even remotely confident wearing. It's not perfect, but I love it.", "summary": "Comfortable and flattering.

If I can't fix it, I will still be very likely to purchase from ADIMANI again. I'm tempted to not even care about the stains and pretend it's part of the \"vintage\" look. The moral of the story is to not let the purse sit in it's box under poor conditions for a long time or else sadness will happen. But again, that is my fault.", "summary": "I think it would have been nice.", "unixReviewTime": 1472342400}

My 16 year old Bohemian bra hating daughter.  She won't wear a normal Victoria Secret type bra, and only wears sports bras.  She is impossible to please.  She wears a 34b in a normal size, and xl in sports bras.  I bought (for a substantial discount in exchange for a review) this bra in size XL.  It fits her perfectly.  She put it on, and  declared  \" it was her new favorite bra.\"\n\nThe bra is of the highest quality, it has no adjustable straps and fits perfectly from the get-go, no pulling or adjusting or trying to cinch things up.  Also, in my opinion, it's not a slutty outfit.  If you were wearing it for Yoga or to the gym as an outfit, it is a soundly sports minded garment.  It doesn't pop the cleavage out, it doesn't say \"here they are, come take a gander\", and honestly, is modest.  It is slightly padded, mostly to hide the pointy anatomy parts.  A good bra is like a sheep dog, it rounds em up, & points em in the right direction. A great bra does the job and you forget you're wearing it.  According to my test subject, this one is 'Great'.", "summary": "Fits Perfectly, Highest Quality", "unixReviewTime": 1461456000}

I recognize that a review of a free product is something fundamentally different from that of a product for which one has paid, but I do believe that reviews can be useful when the review process is respected and I've tried to do that here.\n\nAppearance: This is an ultra lightweight jacket and it is sheer. Center zip front with small pocket over left chest and waist is elasticized.  High collar rides to the top of the neck and the hood can be rolled and tucked into this collar (velcro tabs keep it secure) if you don't want it to drape down the back.\n\nFit: Runs a bit on the small side but if you're using it for running, hiking etc... you may be looking for a tighter fit. Order a size up if you're looking for a loose fit.\n\nBuild: Lightweight nylon that is almost unbelievably light.  Excellent as a windbreaker and for mildly chilly temps.  Does offer resistance to water and will keep you dry in a light rain.  However, it is not waterproof and a steady rain will eventually make its way through.  Design is nice and I like the hood being able to roll into the collar.  Elasticized sleeve cuffs and waist help keep water out.\n\nAnything else of note?:\n-Eligible for free shipping to members of Amazon Prime\n-Free returns\n\nAny negatives?:\n-Runs small, order a size up.\n\nBottom line: This ultra-lightweight jacket is an excellent wind breaker and provides protection from a light rain but is not waterproof.  Works well as an outer shell for cool weather hiking and running.

Even wearing nude underwear/bra wouldn't help since you can still see your entire body through it. With the material being so thin to start as well, I'm afraid after a few washes it might even get thinner/become more see-through. I had a t-shirt once that did that and it started off as a thicker (not see-through) but similar material style as this, but after several washes became too thin to be able to wear without putting another layer under it.

I saw this beautiful classic black dress and I had to see her in it. It has such a lovely classic look and yet it is casual enough for summer wear. She loved it the moment she put it on. It fits her beautifully. She is tall and slender, so it accentuates her figure without being \"too much\" or too traditional. The lace is every so slightly see-through, but in a very tasteful.  A lady could wear this dress just about anywhere without any worries at all.  And yet, it is very sexy. The black color is true to the pictures in the advertisement, but the buckle design was much simpler than in the picture.  The buckle on our dress is fine, so it made no difference that is was different. The lace is very classic and nicely sewn. Although the dress will need some pressing before she wears it the first time, it looks to me like it shouldn't be too much trouble to regularly maintain. My wife is 5 foot 10 and slender. The size large fits her beautifully. The bottom hem hits her right at the knees. The XL would have been too large. The dress has a lovely tapered waist without being too tight or exaggerated.  The pictures don't show it, but the ends of the arms have button cuffs that look really nice when buttoned around the elbows.  Again, its just a nice tasteful addition to the look of this classic dress. The material is high quality and very soft. The buttons around the lace are cute and nicely designed. I received a discount for a fair and unbiased review of this dress, but I love it and would highly recommend it. The quality of the dress is above average for this price range. Everything was nicely sewn and stitched without too many hanging or loose threads. We shop for a lot of clothes for her job and I'd say this dress is easily the quality of what you'd find at Maceys in the states. Highly recommended.", "summary": "Beautiful classic black dress.

He plays outdoor sports every single day and also sweats heavily, so I had hopes that these sleeves would help with the sweating and rashes that come from the constant motion of his arms.  He normally wears a Youth XL or an Adult Small, so we went with the latter.  The sleeves were a good fit, but he felt that the elastic around the top was a bit uncomfortable.  To correct that, he pulled them over the ends of the short sleeves on his shirt, which worked well for him.\n\nWe both noticed that he wasn't quite as sweaty after wearing these sleeves, and he commented that though they didn't necessarily keep his arms cool, they did keep him more comfortable by allowing the sweat to dry faster, so he didn't feel as sticky.  An unintended bonus was discovered when he slid in the dirt, and the sleeves prevented his arms from getting scraped up.\n\nWe are especially happy to have these sleeves now that summer is approaching to help prevent mosquito bites as well as harmful UV rays that can cause skin damage.  The fabric seems very durable.  I have washed them several times already and they are holding up very well, so they will definitely be an often-used item in our household.\n\nI received this product at no cost in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

Upon arrival, our son unpacked this shirt and put it on, wearing it around for the rest of the day... then washing it and wearing it again all day on the 4th of July.\n\nIt looks fantastic on him; he is a skinny volleyball player with broad shoulders and almost no body fat, and the shape, style and pattern of this shirt made him look more 'hunky' than he otherwise looks like in a plain white t-shirt or his v-ball uniform. He loved that!\n\nIf you are looking for a t-shirt of this theme, size, style, construction and price, then I would highly recommend giving this one a try based on our son's experience with it so far.  we plan to look at the seller's other shirts to see if there are similar offerings that he might like for his birthday.\n\nVery recommended.\n\nGo for it.\n\nWe received this item gratis from the manufacturer or one of the sellers, without obligation, and decided to objectively test and review it.

Let me start off with saying that the product itself actually deserves a 5 star rating bc it's very well designed, with nice material that is very comfortable against your skin. Further it's very comfortable to wear & has several adjustments to allow you to loosen or tighten the corset, which is a nice feature. Be sure to pay close attention to the size chart, as it suggests ordering at least one size larger. Which I did, or so I thought, and it was too small. I can tell you that in the end, thier customer service came thru leaving me 100% satisfied. I reordered going up on size and just received it today and here's why my review is 3 stars; of course I couldn't wait to put/try it on, it fits for the most part, it's a little big on the bottom even at the tightest hooks. Then I noticed that it's not the exact same corset, even though I ordered the same one, only a bigger size. This one the backing is like a nylon mesh, as opposed to the full back being made in the same material as the front & corset belt, and the 'panty' bottom is also different. While I still haven't received the corset as described & as I've seen from the 1st corset, I'm going to keep this one, may give it to one of my daughters, and continue my search. Definitely worth the money if you can get one that fits you.", "summary": "Conflicted review", "unixReviewTime": 1510272000}

It's hard to see in the photo, but the bell is a lovely sparkly material which is a really nice touch.\n\nIt may be because I'm a little on the shorter side, but the straps are the perfect length for me to wear over my shoulder and still be able to get my hand in to get keys, chap stick, etc. Also, the interior can be zippered shut, as well there is a smaller pocket inside which has a zipper, and an exterior one too.\n\nThis bag is surprisingly spacious. I fit a large wallet, change purse, planner, and a small makeup bag and still have some room.

My fist problem with it is the coloring, the batman symbol is not yellow/gold as it appears in the picture.

It looks like the hoodie is made with a different material, more of a fleece blanket material, while the rest is more of a cheap Hanes sweat pant material. It make the overall construction appear very cheap. The material also feels odd and has a weird odor to it. I did order up in size so that it would fit. But alas that is also a problem I have. I am 5'1 and weight 120lbs, I bought an XL because based on the size chart, that is what I needed. Well, the sleeves are almost to short and the body is too big. I am afraid to wash it and shrink it, because then the sleeves will be way to short. Considering it took almost 2 full weeks for it to arrive and then to have a sub-par product is disappointing.

I would recommend taking the tie out of its packaging and use a fabric steamer to steam it once over to get the creases out. This tie is made out of cotton, so steaming it should be OK. Since it is cotton, you can also get by with gently hand washing it if it gets dirty and not have to worry about dry cleaning. The tie itself is pretty sharp looking. It is a dark deep red that pairs well with white or black solids. Since it's not as fancy as a silk tie, I wouldn't wear it to a formal formal occasion. Outside of super fancy occasions, this tie should work for any other events.\n\nOverall, I really like this tie. It is sharp looking and cleans easily.

The ink used for the octopus was bleeding everywhere and the image looked pixelated- as if someone printed this curtain through an inkjet printer at home. The fabric itself is very thin/cheap and feels gross when I touch it. Also, there are threads already coming loose from the seams right out of the packaging. In the photos, I have one compared to my Cheshire Cat pillowcase which was sort of what I was expecting- black and white, crisp lines, sketchy details. You can see that obviously, the Octopus curtain is far from that. It is the same color as my sheets! NOT WHAT I WANTED AT ALL. My camera actually made it look a lot better than it looks in person, but hopefully they help.

In a minimalist pendant like this, all the focus is on the stone and setting.  However, there are three main issues:\n\n1.)  The stone is dull---there is no \"fire.\"  I have the dark blue version, and it doesn't have very much life to it.  You can barely even tell it's translucent or blue---it almost looks like opaque black instead of sapphire-colored.\n\n2.)  The setting is a big problem, due to the deep ladle-like shape.  The deep bowl can't lay flat on your neckline, so it wobbles off to one side or the other.  It almost never faces forward properly, and tips to the side very easily.  (See photos.)  The giant, oversized bail doesn't help either.  Since it's so loose on the chain, and narrow in width, there's nothing to help the pendant sit correctly.\n\n3.)  The chain isn't great.  It's a strange type of link---I don't know what it is, maybe some type of cardano link?  It's the slightly stiff kind that doesn't *bend* all the way, if you know what I mean.\n\nThe quality of the setting, as well as the narrow band of clear accent crystals, is decent.  In another color, this necklace would probably be better---perhaps a color that lets more light through.  Since mine doesn't have any sparkle, it's a forgettable piece of jewelry.", "summary": "Dull stone, no \"fire,\" and pendant constantly tips over to one side.", "unixReviewTime": 1476748800}

I am impressed especially at this low price. I got the Green one and it is a very bold Emerald Green color. This is a small pendant but it adds a nice touch of color. It measures about 0.8 inches long. The crystal is about 9 mm in size. That crystal is nice and secure because it has all those prongs holding it in place. I like that. The metal behind the crystal is also nicely decorated. There are shapes cut out from the metal. Lots of pretty little details.\n\nI am happy with the chain I received. It is a thin chain but it matches well with the pendant. Mine has a spring ring clasp. All the metal used for this is plated alloy. The plating is well done and doesn't look cheap. This looks better in person than in the pictures. I am very happy with it. It even came in a nice gift box.\n\n*****DISCLOSURE: Free item received to evaluate and review.

First off let me say it is one size fits all. However the tags all say L, which I'm assuming means Large. If it's large then it's a junior's large, not women's.\n\nThe skirt doesn't have much stretch to the waistband. I measured it and stretches roughly 34 inches in size at the waist, any larger than that will be a tight fit, so I'd measure yourself before buying.\n\nThe top however is very stretchy, I was worried it was going to be too big on me but it's adjustable and fit on the smallest setting. Just laid out, it measures 28 inches long but will stretch well beyond that. It has nice coverage with adjustable straps. It you're trying to wear in public you might need nipple covers, it's barely traslucent.\n\nThe thong ties on the sides so it will adjust to any size body. It's a nice quality, not the dinky elastic string kind you get with many of these outfits. And the hat is double layered so it's nice and thick, which surprised me. It can easily stand up on its own once you unflatten it.\n\nOverall I am very pleased with this outfit. It's very classy and well made, and looks really sexy on. I'm 5'4\" and 115 pounds so I didn't have any trouble with it fitting, but one size fits all doesn't always ring true and the lack of stretch in the skirt is going to limit who can wear this. So keep that in mind before buying. Otherwise I think you'll be pleased with it, I know I am!\n\nThis product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.

(I bought it so I peaked of course, actually, more than peaked but . . .)  It looks amazing, better than the pictures even on the Isobrite site.  It is stylish, classy, and the way it looks in the dark is fantastic!  It has both the tritium t100 markers and some regular, high luminosity markers on the dial.  They have the coolest 3D look in the dark because they are all at different levels - bezel, hands, and markers.\n\nDoes the tritium live up to its claims?  Yes.  It is constantly luminescent, bright but not superbright.  It's just right and blows away the Luminox.  If they don't switch to t100, this company will take their business.  I actually wanted Luminox when I started doing my research and discovered this.  This is 4x brighter and lasts 50 years.  Other brands Luminox, Nite, Traser only last 25 years.  Its a no brainer.  And yes, it's safe.\n\nWhat else?\nArmourlite makes very sturdy watches with good shock proofing.\nIt has superior swiss movement to the vast majority of watches on the market with Ronda 715L not the normal Ronda 540D.\nIt is waterproof to 1000 feet!  Seriously.\nit has a sapphire crystal which I require.  Who wants a scratched up expensive watch?\nBattery life is 10 years.  Why get solar or autowind?  And the wearable electronic watches need constant charging, and are fragile.\nCrown is double gasket and screw in with side shields.\nCase and band are stainless and feel very comfortable on.  ( I have a nice Seiko with stainless and that is the only way to go for me.)\nIts not too big at 46mm - better than comparable Luminox and G-shocks- and I am not a big guy.\nIt can be worn for special occasions and formal wear, and as an everyday go-to because it's almost indestructible (stainless/sapphire/ water resistant to 1000feet).  It is a hefty watch.\nIt looks really classy.  Although I set out for a blackened look, this is actually better because the rose gold makes the watch stand out less on the wrist, and for a watch this size that is a good thing.  I would prefer this a bit blacker.  I am going to but some black, ceramic paint dots on the extra dots between 12 and 3:00 o'clock.\nIt Doesn't have all those extra dials for things you never use.  I know I don't use them, cell phones do those things better.\n\nI do not work for Armourlite/Isobrite, and I received no incentive to write this review.  I just really like the watch.", "summary": "This watch is Awesome!  I love it.", "unixReviewTime": 1513555200}

Unfortunately, the garment fit a little smaller than expected in some area while being much looser than expected in other areas.

I didn't have any problems with it other than that the bottoms are little bit narrower in the back than what Im used to but its definitely not indecent. Its really comfortable to wear and I don't feel like Im overexposed. I like the nonremovable cups in the top portion of the swimsuit because most other bikini tops I have had where the pads were removable the pads would fall out and get destroyed and the swimsuit would be left with no support in the top. With these pads being encased in the suit this will not be a problem. Its true to the pictures and I am far more impressed with it than I thought I would be after reading the other reviews.

I think the title is a bit wrong to say \"push up\" swimsuit because, the point of a push up is to show more, but this does not. It has a very nice hold if that is what they mean! So as far as just discussing the designs and patterns on the suit, it is really cute. The fit of the top is very nice, exactly my size (M). The straps that criss cross in the back are a bit annoying but it's very doable. (Going to give some weird weird weird tan lines that is for sure!). The material of the top seems nice and strong. I have a problem with the cups in the bathing suit. It isn't the best quality and the cup inserts inside of the top are kind of just flying around and very very noticeable. As far as the bottoms go, I do not like them. I got  the bottoms with the three strings on each side and I just hate the design. I got a medium, and yet these swimsuit bottoms fit like a small. If they were the right size I think I would like it more because it would not look so tight and ill-fitted. This product takes a while to get to you and they do not exactly show care when wrapping it up. Over all this product definitely gets a 3 star review because the material is not horrendous, but could be better, the fit is just either perfect for the top , or WAY too tight for the bottoms, and the time it took to get here was a while. I will still obviously wear this top out, but I doubt that I will be wearing these bottoms in public because they are just not comfortable because of the false size and they do not look good.

The watch itself is bulky in nature, and looked very large on my small wrist. The functionality itself is clear and straightforward with a simple operating system and plain appearance.

Yes, you can make/receive phone calls and get your notifications straight from your phone, and even take photos, among other things. However, the messaging app on my specific watch did not work, so I was disappointed in not being able to experience that feature. The battery life is great, and the band is comfortable. However, this product just was not for me and I ended up returning it after trying it out for a while to try and get used to it.

I own other leggings and to be honest M&Z has really out ranked all of them. I love how the print depicts an Egyptian man giving flowers to an Egyptian woman and the colors are so vibrant even after washing. The sewing is done very nicely there is only one seam on the inside of the leggings which I like. The elastic band is good quality and very comfortable on my waist. I really have nothing negative to say about them and to be honest I am shocked they are priced so low when I consider the quality. I do recommend them and as long as you are within the size range I feel you will like them too. These are one size fits all type but, for sizing sake I will say that I am 5'5\" 116lbs and my waist is 29\" and they fit me perfect without much stretching of the material at all. I am so happy with these and so lucky that I received them as a complementary sample in exchange for my evaluation of them and I totally scored on this one because, I am in love :) Thanks and have a great day! ~Kiki", "summary": "WALK LIKE AN EGYPTIAN IN COMFORT AND STYLE! :D", "unixReviewTime": 1472083200}

It was only midlength and the fabric was a very thin, cheap polyester/nylon and overall ugly.  The stripes were blue & gray and horizontal, not diagonal.  There was no striped waistband, just elastic smocking along the waist of the black bodice fabric.  It had a scoop neck, rather than a V neck. The plastic package it was in was not sealed and although the package said it was a size L, the dress was much smaller than that, no bigger than an M.  I expected it to run small as it is Asian sized, but this was beyond just running small.  I'm guessing that the dress I received was on that was returned by another customer and put in the wrong package to send it back. Unfortunately, my fiancee damaged the dress when he cut open the package so I am unable to even return it and hope for the right dress on the 2nd try.  I could have tried to salvage the damage but this dress was so far from what I ordered and such a bad quality that I just threw it away.", "summary": "Not the Dress in the Picture!!", "unixReviewTime": 1462492800}

Like everything else,  sizing can be a bit tricky,  but when in doubt, order true to size.\n\nNote : I received the product at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review.", "summary": "Adorable!", "unixReviewTime": 1460678400}

My daughter is thin but we ordered the large, knowing that it would run small. She could probably have worn a smaller size but this one fits perfectly well.

The tulle is very full and beautiful, but the best part is that the lining is nearly as long as the tulle and it is full enough to twirl in and is a lovely charmeuse fabric. I would highly recommend this skirt. We ordered the light blue and it is very pretty. The price is a bit higher than similar skirts but well worth it.\n\nAdditional information: I ordered another of these skirts in the silver color, and the color was not attractive.

This came with three pieces, a little hat, a top and bottoms. The bottoms of this are too cute, they are red with white polka dots and around the top there is a green ruffley piece!

The top also has two little strawberries leaves on it, and in the center of it there is a little bow with small fabric strawberries attatched!!! The hat is slightly small, or maybe my kids have big heads, lol. I ordered this in a size 5t for my three year old who typically wears a size 5t and it fits nicely. This is pretty well made, my only complaint would be that the little strawberries are not attatched very well, one fell off already, so I'll have to sewn them on better before she swims at the pool!

The waist is a good quality elastic and stretches just fine.  I wore this with a belt over it and a tank top with sandals for a casual look and with a pretty blouse and heels for a dress up look. It's very versatile.  You will feel so fem and flirty in this skirt.  I got it at a discount I exchange for a review so honestly I did t know what to expect, but i was pleasantly surprised and now it's my new fave skirt!", "summary": "I can not say enough about how awesome this skirt is", "unixReviewTime": 1467936000}
