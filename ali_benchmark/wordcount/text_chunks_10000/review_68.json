I got the XL messenger bag in the Lake Green color and it is very nice shade of green. I wanted something a bit brighter than the traditional army green. I normally carry a large purse and thought this would be perfect to carry all my stuff. It is made from a thick canvas material and has many little pockets to store all my goodies. I like that the front pockets have snaps and the middle zipper keeps things secure, instead of just folding over the top. I don't have to worry that I will lose anything. The strap is thick and has a pad, so it does not dig into your shoulder when you carry it. The front buckles seem to be more for looks than function, as they are a bit magnetic, but don't seem to stick well. I don't mind because the snaps keep the front pockets secure and the buckles complete the look of the bag.\nAs you can see from my pictures, there is lots of storage space. You have front pockets, side pockets (which could easily fit a cell phone), a small inner pocket on the inside, and the main part of the bag, which as you can see is large enough to stash a whole bank bag.

It was packaged well to insure it arrived in excellent condition.  This is the best investment I have ever made in a purse.

The interior is made of a heavy weight lining, with a large spacious interior, and three pockets sewn to one side of the purse. It is the perfect depth, because when I open it I can see the bottom of the bag, and everything that's in it at a glance!!  On one side of the purse there three pockets sewn into the same spot.  Two with zippers and one an open pocket sandwiched between them.  I put 7-8 makeup items in one, my checkbook in another and several small misc. items in the open pocket.  BAM  organized!  on the other side of the purse there are two slender  pockets. I put my work ID badge and keys in one, and my sunglass clip in the other.  These don't \"fall\" open into the purse body, they \"hug\" the side they are sewn into.  All of the metal buckles and rings are heavy weight, including the zipper pull.  The zipper moves easily. I am a shorter person so the two attached handles work as a shoulder bag for me, but I will keep the longer strap on this purse, as I like to have the option of using it as a cross-body bag when carrying it a long distance.  When all the belongings are in the purse it sits nicely without falling over.  The leather is soft and supple, with a soft shine, and it smells just as I expect authentic leather to smell when new.  Judging by the craftsmanship I expect to use this bag for a long time.  I am going to buy it in brown and white as well.  Great Purse HeShe!  Where have you been all my life?

I was looking for something a little different and seemed to look great on the model. This \"outfit\" was not any of these.\n\nFirst let me tell you if you are a medium or larger the only piece that will fit is the mesh part. The skirt will only fit a child or a small person maybe. The jacket should fit, but I hope you don't want the sleeves to reach your wrist because they will not. They seem to also be made for a child with small arms. The only way to get this outfit to look faltering or like the picture, you will have to modify it your self. Salvage or just toss this in the trash? Decisions....\n\nFor the price the stitching is horrible and will come a part after a wear or two. I will also note the jacket is not as pictured and the mesh dress part is not either. It had straps in the picture that do not exist in reality. You get a thong with the out fit, but that will not fit anyone with how it was crafted.\n\nI would return this to get a full refund, but you can't with this type of clothing. This thing is not worth the price charged, is put together like the sweat shop was on strike, really does not match what is shown on Amazon, randomly sized per part, and just not worth the disapointment.

I bought these products because I had been hitting the wall in terms of my PB circuit times for the trails/mountains I run, and I was looking for a way to gain more speed. My plan was to train with the added weight and try to drop to my old PB WITH the weight, then run without the weight on race days. The results of this have been nothing short of spectacular, and both Titin products work great, but in terms of bang for the buck, I think the shorts do more for me based on my primary application despite being lighter than the weighted shirt. A slightly more detailed analysis of that follows.\n\nWhile you can add more weight with the shirt than you can with the shorts, the weight placement on the shorts is more targeted and makes activities that involve running or climbing stairs quite a bit more difficult than just adding more weight to carry. You're carrying about 1.7lbs (3 gels) around your mid thigh per leg in addition to the gel that is carried higher and closer to your hip, so every time you lift your leg to step, you're lifting that extra weight before pushing off. 1.7lbs may not sound like much, but after a few hundred stairs, you absolutely feel it. In a few hundred more stairs, you start thinking fantasizing about taking the shorts off and burying them. I mean that in the best way possible. But when I run races without the weight, I feel like I'm running on the moon. It's amazing how much lighter and more explosive you feel when you do the same activities without the weight that you'd been doing to train with the weight.\n\nIf you already have the Titin compression shirt, I still highly recommend the shorts. Depending on your application, you may benefit from the lower center of gravity that the shorts provide. The shirt alone can make you a little top heavy, although that may be exactly what you're looking for to enhance your workout. In any case, I can't think of a workout that would NOT be enhanced by these items.\n\nBoth the shirt and the shorts fit well and keep the gel weights pretty firmly in place. I trail/stair run in both of these products, and the weights do not bounce or take on a life of their own. That was a real concern of mine before spending the serious dollars that these products cost, but Titin seems to have solved that problem. While the shirt system has an extra compression shirt that helps keep the weights secure, I just wear normal workout shorts over the Titin shorts, and it feels just fine. The shorts have a belt mechanism up top to keep them from falling down, and it actually worked surprisingly well. I'm normally a men's medium for things like shorts and underwear, and the medium-sized shorts fit me perfectly.\n\nSo why not 5 stars?\n\nJust a few reasons:\n\n1.  Inserting and removing the gel weights is quite a hassle. That's in part just the price you pay for the weights being held so securely in place. Still, in Titin's 2.0 version, I'd like to see weight pockets that were just a little easier to manage, possibly with wider openings and some kind of fastener or flap to close when the weights are in. The weights are a much bigger pain to insert into the shirt, however.\n\n2. The weights themselves are also not particularly washable, and trust me, they are going to get quite sweaty. The gels are coated in some kind of lycra-like fabric, and I've yet to find a really effective way to clean them. They don't smell bio-hazard awful yet, but I feel like they may someday.\n\n3. Cost. These shorts are expensive, and there's not much about them that seems to justify the cost. They are shorts with pockets and a basic belt, and weights are just some kind of gel that probably cost $0.50 to make. They are not spun from spider silk or designed by Jony Ive. The quality is fine, but still, the price point is perhaps a bit high for most people. Similar things might be said about other \"simple\" fitness products however. I'm looking at you, TRX. In any case, the shorts are significantly cheaper than the shirt, so if you are only going to buy one or just want to try it first, maybe the shorts are the best way to wade in.", "summary": "Shorts that kick your. . .", "unixReviewTime": 1462233600}

It does not look cheap nor does it shed on your clothes. I plucked it to see how well it is made. Very warm, cozy to wear not thin at all. You can wear a body fitted top or light sweater and be just fine.  I am totally surprised of the quality because I wanted a leather sherling coat but its heavy since I drive daily. This coat is slightly medium weight.\n\nThis coat is similar to the leather sherling coat Again it does not look cheap !!! It is faux fur and suede like material is polyester. The belt is annoying because it does not tighten. I suppose you can remove the belt and it looks just fine. Ykk zippers are heavy duty, smooth and good quality. It is dry clean only. If it get wet (rain) , it states to hang dry or color may transfer. My new Bear Paw Tall boots is the exact same color (Tan) from Amazon also. The coat is a warm shade darker than the image. The coat and boots match very well. This new coat is here to stay this winter. I hope this helps in your decision.", "summary": "Beautiful Warm Coat!

The cloth is only brushed on the outside so it's not soft on the inside next to your skin.

The material is lightweight and flows easily. In my opinion the dress is casual because of the fabric so do not expect to get a thick, ridged fabric for a very formal event. Construction is nice and all the seams were finished. Arrived clean and quick.\nI rated that it fit a bit large because I had read all the reviews and even measured myself against the manufacturers chart (the second photo in the color dress I was ordering and not the link amazon provides for sizing). I'm normally a medium and the chart said my measurements fit a medium but the reviews said to order a size up. The large had free shipping and returns while the medium only had free shipping and not returns. I opted for the large but I wish I would have stayed with the chart. The waist area is too big but there is a belt and with that cinched you can't tell. The extra fabric just adds to the volume of the skirt area so I will keep it as is. My best guess is that the manufacturer has responded to complaints of the sizes running too small or people have not been measuring themselves wrong and/or choosing the correct corresponding size. Most of the dresses shown fit in the bust and waist area and not in the hip and shoulder area so ignore those. You should then measure yourself (look up how to measure your bust and waist if you aren't sure) and then pick the size off the largest measurement (if you are a 32\" bust and a 24\"waist then buy the dress size that corresponds to a 32\" bust). This is a very tailored cut so if you are large chested and small around the middle you may really need to rely on the belt or have it altered. For the price it could be worth it. If you are looking at one of the dresses with sleeves you will need to take your shoulder width into account.", "summary": "The material is lightweight and flows easily.

I was very worried because it says one size fits all, which is not ever really the case. I wear a size large and was worried that it would look ridiculous on me. There are a lot of clothing items on line that are in Asian sizing and I was worried this outfit would run way too small, but it did not. I believe it is would fit up to maybe a size 14. The breast area is a little small so if you are big breasted it will just cover the lower portion, which could be bad or good considering what you are purchasing. The part that wraps around your chest is made of very stretchy elastic, so it could fit someone very small and someone like me who wears a size large with a little extra space. Believe me, I am very self conscious of my weight and appearance and this actually looked fine on me. Although it is shear, it is like a baby doll top so it covers your flaws well. The panties are stretchy as well so they could also fit different sized people. It came in a plastic zip lock type bag. The bow was on there nicely and did not look cheap. The outfit is made well. It has adjustable spaghetti straps so again you can customize the fit. Overall, great lingerie set. I was impressed.

They make sure you are completely satisfied with your purchase by sending you an email asking if you are satisfied and if you are not they are happy to send you something better. This is how you know you can purchase from this company and also trust them.\nQuality&fit: this item is super cute and sexy! Great for the summer because it is a little see-threw. So if you want to wear this out then you need a slip to wear with it, but it would be perfect for the beach and also on top of a bathing suit. Love it!!!\nShipping: was quick and efficient, the package arrived on time, clean, and nicely packaged.\nSizing: I am 145 pounds 5\"4 34DDD.

I love that they came in plastic bags because if you have ever owned a pair of shoes made from this material, you know how easy they are to scuff and ding. I am definitely going to be purchasing these in the wine color and looking further into any other shoes from this brand!\n\nI received a discounted sample from the manufacturer in exchange for my honest opinion.

As a 34G or sometimes 34H, I knew these were just for very light support, lounging so I was not expecting an actual support bra. I found the description to be accurate and like that they have a three hook back closure. The fabric is far more stretchy than I anticipated although soft to the touch. The back band was extremely loose, again I followed chart provided by seller, and the cup/getting area was fine, more coverage than anticipated. As others have mentioned the padding is awkward. Even after adjusting and unfolding them out looked as though I had \"two thick paper plates\" (comment from partner) that are too small to cover the whole area so it looks even worse. If the band had been tight enough I would've attempted it by taking them out but it is far too loose. I will return and look for a brand that has slightly sturdier band.\nMight be perfect for another, just not meeting my needs.\n\nUPDATE:\nI ordered this in a medium as a last effort - They cover (kind of) but are so stretchy that they constantly need adjustment.

I have a Marina dress that is pretty much exactly the same style as this one I bought a few years ago for about $100.\nI'm 5'0\" 128lbs.  I bought 3 of these dresses 2 in 6 and 1 in 8 (teal, white, black).  Each of the dresses fit differently.  One of the size 6's was huge- really felt like it was mislabeled- could've easily been a 12.  Serious quality control problems. Nonetheless- I did like the dresses.\nThe dress I ALMOST kept was the size 6 teal.\nPROs:  Teal color as actually lovely- looks much more classy than I expected from the picture.  Its a deep jewel-toned teal.  The monochrome teal beading and sequins actually elevate the look of the dress rather than make it look cheap. Can't really beat the dress for the price.\nCONs: Sewing wasn't best quality.  some small pieces of lace were not sewn into the seam.  There's also a weird tulip-shape/flip out to the bottom hem.  Not sure if that was intentional because it wasn't symmetric on both sides of the dress.  Would have been better if the hem was straight/more pencil-line. Also -If you are moderately busty like me- this dress shows a rather lot of cleavage.  It doesn't look bad from the front, but I'm short and looking down from the top - borders on lookiing like you're falling out of the dress.  ALSO- there is opaque fabric at the bust underneath the lace sleeves but it is much too small an area for effective coverage.  And because of that- unless you have teal undergarments- basically your friends and family will be looking at your bra or spanx underneath the lace.  No bueno.\nAlso, there is no petite sizing so, I felt like I could have shortened the length from the princess seam to the shoulders- felt like the shoulders were going to fall off all the time- but if you're taller it might not be a problem for you.\n\nI almost kept it and was going to try to sew up the areas that were weird on me- for $10 you can't go wrong--, and it really was a beautiful color... but I really just didn't need another dress.", "summary": "Sizes are inconsistent.

I find it hard to tell when I order clothing online whether it is going to be true to size or how it is ultimately going to look when I finally try it on, so I was very happy that when I received the dress, it fit perfectly. Before ordering I carefully read the size chart and chose a size 8. The chart gave me exactly the measurements I needed, so I didn't have to guess what to order. The dress is flattering from every angle and it isn't tight or binding anywhere ~ including the bust or waist. The construction of the dress is beautiful in every way. There is a matching slip underneath the lace that is sewn into the dress itself. My complaint with most dresses like this is that the lace will ride up when you sit or bend over exposing the slip, but this dress actually has the slip sewn strategically into the lace over it (including about an inch from the bottom hem), so it will always stay where right where it is supposed to and move naturally with me. The lace and the beading are gorgeous - intricate and elegant without being gaudy. Everything is sewn so nicely too - no loose threads and no loose beads anywhere. The entire dress is lightweight to wear as well and it comes to just above the knee so it can be worn for a variety occasions. The design is flattering for so many body types. I feel elegant and feminine when I wear this and I would not hesitate to buy another garment from this designer again or recommend this dress to anyone woman wanting to feel good about what she is wearing when she wants to look her best.

Ram", "reviewText": "My mother loves to go dancing and also hosts a lot of parties. I'm always on the lookout for cute and fashionable dresses for her. She likes a sophisticated and modern look, without going overboard.\n\nThis dress caught my eye, so I ordered it as a Christmas gift. Since I'm similar in size, I tried it on to check the fit and be sure it wasn't too small or large. It's pretty spot on, although someone with a smaller waist might have to pull it in a bit. It's still not enough of an issue for me to consider it as running large. I also loved the fact that it's true to the length shown in the photos! Some cheaper dresses tend to arrive and are WAY too short. That is not at all an issue with this dress. It's the perfect length, just as the pictures show.\n\nThe lace and beading is not done any justice, by the photos. I took a close up pic to add to my review and show readers. It's a beautiful fabric and beading, up close. The color might be a hair more blue than teal, but it's still gorgeous.\n\nI absolutely adore this dress and I know my mom will love it. I'm going to order another one for myself. This dress was sold to me at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Photos don't do it justice", "unixReviewTime": 1447545600}

Tumble it on low in the dryer to get rid of wrinkles.\n\nAnn Arbor T-shirt Co. has a number of really funny tees in its catalog here on Amazon.

On this one, after looking carefully at the description, I chose the XL size and it fits perfectly. Go figure.\n\nThis shirt is pretty high quality. The material is a bit on the thin side, though I don't think that is a sign of bad material. It is just the kind of material the maker used on the shirt. I personally like my tee shirts a little bit thinner anyway.\n\nThe seams are strong and seem like they will hold up to normal wear and tear. I don't see any strings that were left hanging off during the manufacturing process.\n\nThe tag is printed on the inside of the shirt. So there is no tag hanging out bugging your neck.\n\nThe printing on the shirt is also nice quality. It is pretty normal tee shirt printing. I've had some other tee shirts that have the image off center or have folds in the printing. This shirt doesn't do any of that. The colors are vibrant (it looks like there are 3 colors used) and the lines are sharp. This shirt is a kind of weird mashup of chemistry and Game of Thrones themes called \"Noble Gases.\" I'm not sure I get it honestly.  But as a t-shirt, it is goofy enough that I'll probably wear it anyway.\n\nThese shirts are also made in the USA. I'm not usually too picky about these things, but it is nice to think there is a factory in Michigan making the shirt I am wearing.\n\nI received a small discount on this shirt for agreeing to honestly review it.

So I decided it was time to try it out. But as a person who has studied medical herbalism (including colon cleansing substances) for decades, I'm extremely unimpressed.

But here's the problem: even though I would expect such a product to include psyllium seed as the primary ingredient, in this case the other ingredients are present in such minute amounts that (1) you can barely tell they're present at all, and (2) the small quantities of these other ingredients make for a product that has no greater cleansing action than plain psyllium without any additional herbs. I've used many such products, and this one I feel is very poorly formulated, and gives you a false idea that there is some kind of special synergistic action from the combination. You would be better off either buying another product, or at least just buying plain psyllium, because it would cost you a lot less money.

I am very picky when it comes to clothing and the way they fit.  I am short and curvy so things can fit awkwardly sometimes.  I think that the amount of stretch that this skirt has is just the perfect amount to make this a universally comfortable and well fitting skirt.  The material is stretchy but doesn't have that cheesy elastic look or feel.  It feels like a nice thick cotton and is perfect with thin sweater that can be tucked in for fall.  I am totally in love with the black and white diamond pattern of this material!  It is adorable and so fashionable.  I am 5 feet and this pencil skirt falls a little above mid calf on me.  It's the perfect length for this style of skirt.  I debated on whether to get a medium or a large because my size can really go either way but I am very happy with the fit of the large.

The material is 75% Polyester and 25% Rayon. It has a little stretch to it and moves with you when wearing and is very comfortable and soft to touch. There are 2 seams down the front of it to dress it up some. I got this for my daughter who is 5'9\" tall and the length was perfect on her and came right below her knee. Waist is elastic and is a wider band so it doesn't curl over when worn. All the seams and hem is sewn very well. Very cute skirt to wear for business dress or casual with flip flops or sandals. My daughter loves it and we 100% recommend this to everyone...you will not be disappointed.\nI received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

There were several issues with it. First, I am 5'3\" and 125 lbs.  I bought a size 6, according to the chart. The dress is very fitted, and was too tight through the hips and thighs. I am small, but curvy, so maybe someone slimmer would do ok. I don't think a size up would have helped, because the proportions were also off for me. The black band that appears to fit under the bust was more down on my waist, which made the top fit awkwardly. Again, maybe someone taller would be ok, but then the dress might be too short. It was not long on me. In fact, with a small heel, it would have been just right in the length. But other than the fit, I just didn't like the look of the dress. It looks good in the picture, but in person, the lace is very shiny and looks cheap. The lining is a nude color, which doesn't show in the pic, but does show under the white part. The top of the dress is padded, almost too padded, but is not supportive. This also made the top look weird. I think you could get away with a strapless bra, but I didn't try it.

It says it is a men's bag but anyone can use this and look great! I want it for myself not my husband. Maybe we can share it... This canvas material is very strong and durable. It can take lots of abuse. This feels like it is well built and will last me a long time. The bag is sporty looking but still remains elegant.\n\nThe strap is easily adjustable. You can make it very long or shorter. It is a thick durable strap that will not be breaking easily. The strap is a little different tone color of beige than the actual bag. That is fine with me because I think it breaks up the color pattern and adds a nice touch to the bag. The front flap closes with 2 magnetic buttons. Under the flap are 2 zippered compartments. I really like that this bag has a separate front zippered compartment. That way I can keep some thing seperate and easily have access to them when I need them. The zippers are well made and durable also. The main zippered compartment is nice and wide. Lots of room there to put all my things. There is an extra zippered pocket inside the main compartment wall. On the other wall are 2 open pockets. One smaller and one larger. The back of the messenger bag also has a zippered compartment.\n\nGreat messenger bag with lots of places to put all my things securely. I highly recommend it to men and women alike.\nPlease see my video where I show you all the compartments.\n\n**I received this item free of charge in exchange for my honest unbiased review.", "summary": "Awesome bag for men or women.", "unixReviewTime": 1447200000}

I had previously only bought items like this that were Sazac brand and had really liked those, but decided to get this one since the picture looked the same and this was less expensive (like $20 difference at the time). I was a little disappointed when I received this because it was definitely cheap costume quality and not at all the nice fleecy feel of the Sazac stuff we usually get. I figured I would keep it though since I really only bought this as a costume for Halloween. Well, then it was just downhill from there. As soon as I put it on, one of the buttons fell off. This thing is very wide (as these usually are made wide to fit all sizes) so it was not because it had any pressure being put on the button. As the night went on, another button fell off. Then a third button fell off when I took the costume off. Like someone mentioned before, the feel of this is more \"felt\" like on the outside and then a kind of jersey like fabric on the inside. There are no pockets, figured I would mention that as well. I am giving two stars instead of one because, overall, the costume is cute and comfortable enough to wear for just one day. Don't expect this to last you any longer than one day though. If you want something that will last, I recommend going with a Sazac version and pay the extra money. I would not buy this brand again and would not recommend this particular item to others.", "summary": "Don't expect it to last", "unixReviewTime": 1447459200}

Creager", "reviewText": "The Blue Iron Cross pendant is made of pewter and is about an inch and a quarter in height and width. The ring for the necklace has been widened, apparently, since this item's original release- I recall buying one back in 2005 or so and the ring was much smaller. Guess Dan Jewelers- seems they're the maker- got some complaints about that. I appreciate their efforts, but I think they could've gone for a medium instead of large ring-size-increase. Anyway. More importantly, while the pendant came very nicely packaged in clear plastic, placed in a small black pouch no bigger than the palm of one's hand, it had for a necklace a much-too-cheap rope-thing. Some kind of black synthetic rope material. The older one I had came with a simple metal chain necklace- like that found on dog-tags- and that worked a lot better. That's what I did with mine- took the chain from some surplus ROTC dog-tags, and placed that on the pendant instead. I'd like to see the manufacturer give us a choice of factory-issue pendants, but it's not that hard to do a little extra work and get the right necklace yourself.\n\nHaving been sold since 2005 at least, this Iron Cross pendant has certainly endured on the marketplace. There's at least two other versions, the difference being the color in the center of the cross- the other two are red and black. This pendant is well-made and looks good, and the price of $13- plus shipping, of course- I paid is about right. I can certainly recommend it.", "summary": "Great pendant, but that cheap necklace has gotta go.", "unixReviewTime": 1333324800}

I'm always a little hesitant with buying pearls online because they usually tend to look cheap, but this necklace is actually very pretty and doesn't look cheap at all. The pearls are an off-white cream color and are graduated in size from the ends to the center. When stretched out, the pearl section of the necklace measures about 18\" long, and there is a 3.5\" silver chain at one end so that you can adjust the length. It has a lobster claw clamp, and the pearl stands are strung on what appears to be fairly heavy-duty wire. I love the \"twisted\" design of the pearl strands - it has a very classy and elegant look. Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend this necklace to others.\n\n*Discounted product received for testing and review purposes. I have no affiliate with the seller or manufacturing company, and I did not receive any compensation for testing or reviewing the product. All opinions are my own and were not influenced by the seller in any way.\n\n**UPDATE - 9/23/16**\nThe first time I wore this necklace, I only had it on for about 4-5hrs total and was very careful with putting it on and taking it off. However, the second time I put it on (again, carefully), I got in my car to leave for school and as I was pulling out of my driveway, I started to hear a noise that sounded like little beads hitting the sides of my car door and floor. I looked down and realized that one of the necklace strands had broken and the pearls were falling ALL over my car. I tried cleaning up all the pearls that had scattered all over my car, but I'm still finding little pearls here and there randomly. I'm so disappointed because I really liked this necklace!!!! I can technically still wear it with only 2 strands of the pearls, but now I'm paranoid that the other strands are also going to break and make a mess (and potentially be fall risk if the pearls go all over the floor).  :(", "summary": "**UPDATED 9/23** - Broke the Second Time Ever Worn", "unixReviewTime": 1472860800}

I bought this belt in mid July, I hardly ever have occasion to wear belts in the summer since I usually only wear them with long pants or jeans, so it got very little use until September.  Since that time I have worn it probably about 2 months worth of use.  The back side of the belt started to wear some at the belt hole I was using by October.  By the end of December it had worn completely through the backside piece of leather and some sort of black liner stitched in between the back side and the top side.  The top side is still holding together well, likely a higher quality piece of leather, but with the backside torn all the way through, the belt is almost unusable now.  I have leather belts I've worn for well over 20 years that are still in very good shape.  This is either a defective product or just a poorly manufactured one.  The company had no interest in seeing photos of the belt, they just denied my getting a replacement, or refund.  I recommend staying away from this product and the company, both are substandard in my view.\n\nNOTE: I am very judicious about giving poor review as anyone can see from my profile, however this product and the company lack of interest in resolving my complaint warranted this review.  I never had a direct reply from the company, I only learned they denied any replacement or refund when I inquired again through Amazon.

It is an interesting design concept as I like the idea of having an infinitely adjustable belt. But unfortunately where it stands tall on promise, it falls short on delivery. After having had this belt for a few months now, it is starting to slip on its own. I'm just a regular guy and only wear it during the day while I'm at work. I have another belt that I wear when I'm home and working in my shop or running errands. So it hasn't encountered any harsh or undue wear. The trouble seems to be in the ratcheting or latching mechanism. That part is made of plastic and I suppose over some time and usage it's simply wearing at the point of contact to the point where it is slipping and letting go. I don't think it is simply a dud as the belt held quite snugly when I first received it.

I'm 5'8, and normally wear a size 12, so I ordered it in that size and it fit me perfectly. The cups are padded enough that I was able to skip wearing a bra, and it was cut well enough to be comfortable under the arms.\n\nThe dress did arrive very wrinkled from shipment, but I was able to smooth the fabric out with a hand held steamer. Made of 100% polyester, the dress has a satiny soft liner that feels great against the skin,  an outer later that feels like chiffon (but isn't), and a concealed zipper down the back that functions smoothly.\n\nThis is a tastefully modest dress with just a bit of see through fabric at the upper chest above the bust line and at the upper back. It drapes nicely and flows gracefully when walking, and the gorgeous sequined flowers at the waist and neck add a lovely touch of elegance.\n\nOther than a few loose thread ends that I snipped, some of the ends of the sequined flowers weren't fully sewn down. Otherwise, the dress would be perfect. The seams are all properly aligned and neatly stitched, and the workmanship of the sequined appliques is exquisite. Overall, this dress is a very good quality and looks gorgeous.\n\n.", "summary": "Lovely and fits true to size", "unixReviewTime": 1463270400}

With high baggage fees, I tend to carry on everything onto the plane, and divide my things between my roll aboard luggage and my laptop backpack.\n\nMy search criteria: padded laptop sleeve, large capacity for traveling but still fits under the seat, good depth size for stuffing my things into it, multiple pockets for putting essential travel items and for easy access, and able to hold water bottle. This backpack fits my needs.\n\nPro:\n-Padded laptop sleeve. The bottom of the sleeve doesn't sit on the bottom of the bag, so you won't be hitting your laptop on the ground when setting your backpack down.\n-Large capacity of space for the main compartment. A very good depth too to place large items. In my picture I have a red box inside that has a depth of 5.25\" that fits in there comfortably. This same box doesn't fit into my old backpack.\n-The water bottle holder on the side of the bag is very tall. So bottles won't fall out when running with pack on. Can also jam lots of miscellaneous things into the mesh bag.\n-Middle compartment has inside pockets for pens, cards, small things.\n-Outside compartment can fit a tablet or book in there. It fits my 7\" tablet. I think it'll fit a 10\" one too.\n-Bottom of bag has a zippered compartment where you can separately place items in. The separate compartment does share space with the main compartment of the bag.\n\nCon:\n-The flap covering for the main compartment makes it a little hard to use the zipper.\n-The lining of the bottom access bag isn't very thick. I don't think it's meant to be used as extending the backpack out and making it longer, but rather is used as a separate compartment space. But if in a bind and I run out of space on my luggage and don't want to check in luggage and pay that $20 baggage fee, I have the option of pulling that extra space out and being able to stuff a couple more items in.\n-My old backpack had a key clasp where I can hook my keys into without fishing around and looking for it. This one doesn't have one.\n\nI purchased this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "good depth size for stuffing my things into it", "unixReviewTime": 1465084800}

Each compartment can be zippered closed, with the largest compartment having a padded laptop space as well.\n\nAs you can see on my video, the straps are padded and adjustable to your desired fit.  The two sides have a space for your water bottles (fits standard size bottles!).  The only thing I wish it had was a small zippered pouch or slot for my wallet and phone.  Seeing it has slotted pockets in one of the compartments though I think I will be using those to store my phone and wallet instead.\n\nOverall I really like this backpack.  I love the pink color, and the water resistant fabric.  I am thrilled I received a free sample in exchange for my review.

It did need to be ironed, a first for my lingerie, usually there's only one thing in the bedroom I'm concerned with getting wrinkles out of and, it's not my clothing. :))  I truly wanted to be able to give this 5 stars because when I saw it, I thought it was quite sexy. When I first tried it on,the cups fit my DD boobs like a dream. I really thought I had hit the lingerie jackpot......then the laughter kicked in. The front bow isn't nearly as long as portrayed in the photo.\nI leaned over, deciding that would be the best approach for getting the girls properly positioned for the tying part. When I straightened up and looked in the mirror, I laughed. One headlight was too high, one too low. There is no extra \"bow\" to compensate for maladjusted parts. I kept trying to get everything just right and finally gave up. The bra bow is actually very short.\n\nAs others have said, the G-string is fairly small although I will be able to wear it if I choose. The bowed panties are perfect, no need to even use the G string. The ribbon is plenty long when tied. We'll see what happens tonight when I wear it for my husband who doesn't know anything about it's existence. It's supposed to be an early Valentines outfit. I'm expecting that when he sees it, the wrinkles will instantly disappear, and we'll consider this a $5 grand slam. ;0  Since I will have taken the initiative to get things going, he really won't be concerned with the parts being in the wrong place.\n\nI'm guessing if you had artificial or just young perky breasts, hadn't breastfed multiple children, or just had smaller boobs that didn't resemble the ladies pictured in National Geographic, that this would be a real fire starter in the bedroom. I would probably have to recommend purchasing this ensemble if for no other reason, it is sexy and very reasonably priced. I will most assuredly be getting my $5 worth from this set.\n\nTo the seller, it was packaged  in an enormously over-sized boxed, also add about 8 inches to each side of the bra's bow.", "summary": "Go ahead, what do you really have to lose", "unixReviewTime": 1486944000}

I'd guess it only blocks about 80% of light. Also, even though it fits me perfectly, it still feels like it's squeezing my eyes. I even tried wearing it loose, just tight enough to stay on. But when I wake up my eyes are very dry because the cotton was pressed firmly against them all night. I wanted this to work for me so much because there's a surprisingly short list of organic sleep wear out there for a decent price, but sadly I'll be sending this back.

When my package came in, I received a S. I'm pretty petite and I feel like a XS would have fit a little better.\n\nThe item description also says to make sure that the Ezcosplay trademark is on the shirt. This trademark is not on my shirt and the tag says \"Die Die Fashion.\" I did not venture off the main page to different sellers when I ordered this item. Due to this and some other problems with the shirt, I'm thinking that I did not receive an authentic Ezcosplay shirt. So to future buyers, double check that you're ordering from Ezcosplay.\n\nThe physical appearance of the shirt is slightly different than the model photo. The color in the photo shows a darker green color. The actual shirt was more of a lighter olive color. I put the shirt on, and I was expecting the shirt to accentuate my waist like the model photo. Instead, I felt kind of like I was wearing a brown paper bag. I felt like this made me look larger than what I actually am. So, I put a thin belt on around my waist to show my figure. It was pretty cute with the belt, but I would have preferred it to look like the picture so I could wear it without the belt.\nA huge disappointment to me was that when it arrived, it came with a hole in the front left side. I probably would have left this item 4 stars if it wasn't for the hole.\n\nDespite a few issues with the shirt, there are still some good qualities to it. It is made from a light weight material that is super soft. The style of the shirt is pretty cute on. The cut outs on the shoulders are where they are supposed to be and it isn't to low cut. I could see me wearing this shirt with blue jeans or jean shorts. Overall, it's an okay shirt if you can look past a few errors, which I can.\n\n*I was given this shirt at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.", "summary": "Has a few issues.", "unixReviewTime": 1445817600}

I really like these kind of small loops earrings but often these kinds of clasps undo and easy to lose earrings (especially true for active kids). I have attached pictures of my child (light hair) wearing these earrings and also a photo of myself wearing them. They are on the larger side for kids but still very nice... they may be more suitable for teens I think. But they also look nice on me I think since they are not too small and not too large for an adult to wear also. Also I have noticed that on the amazon description it says they are \"Girls\" but on the label shipped to me (as on the third picture I attached it says \"Womens\"). They ship in that black velvety pouch, as pictured. I had received this product at a slight discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

I didn't expect much of it at this price point, but I expected everything to at least work but possibly break under too much pressure.\n\nFirst off, the screwdrivers. This set came with three precision screwdrivers. I pulled one out to unscrew the back of my Casio watch and couldn't turn the screw. At first I thought maybe the screw was stripped, but then I realized the screwdriver tip was just spinning in the shaft of the screwdriver. I grabbed the tip and gently pulled it, and it came right out. I pulled the other two screwdrivers out to test them. I was able to remove the tips from both with one hand by holding the screwdriver with three fingers and using my thumb and index finger to pull up on the tips. Thats how loose they were. Needless to say, the screwdrivers were not functional right out of the box.\n\nSecondly, one of the holes on the wrench that you are supposed to attach a tip to is either too small or not threaded correctly because I was not able to screw the tip in. Luckily, I was able to use it with only two tips to open up my screw-back case watches.\n\nThird, the hammer is too long for the case. Its as if they just tossed a random hammer in that wasn't even made for the tool set. You will notice in my pictures that it is longer than the inside of the case and that when zipped up it cannot be completely closed and protrudes from the case. In fact, they had tried so hard to fit the hammer in for shipping that the zipper was pulled apart from being stretched where it was supposed to have been zipped. I had to force the zipper pull over the open section so that I could then zip it up properly.\n\nFinally, the small plastic bag that holds the bracelet pins was ripped open and there were loose pins in the kit. The plastic was extremely thin, so it probably could have ripped from someone sneezing on it (an exaggeration but you get the point).\n\nIm giving this 2 stars because the wrench was at least able to do what I needed it to do and the pry knife and pry tool seem to work well. I have not had to use any of the other parts yet. To have this many quality issues right from the start is very disappointing, though. Im not going to bother to return it because the pieces that I need do what I need them to do, and I already own a good quality precision screwdriver kit.

I got this for work because of the leather and they way I know it will stand the test of time. Generally the stitching will be the first to go in these type bags but the leather will last as long as you take care of it. I was surprised at how well made this bag is. The stitching is thick and I have no doubt it will hold up over time. The pockets are a nice addition as well as the inner separator to keep things from banging into your laptop. Now it did fit my 15.5 laptop just fine. It was a little snug but I have a case on mine too. So I expected it to be. I have provided a video and I encourage you to watch it to see my full review. I am giving this a very very high 5 star review. Its an amazing laptop bag or a briefcase bag in general.\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond. If you found my review helpful, let me know. Lets keep making better buying decisions together. Thank you and as always Be Safe & Happy Shopping!!

This bag absolutely epitomizes that look, with the combination of geometry, esoteric/occult symbols, and striking, white graphics.\n\nIt's faux/vegan leather and feels quite durable. The strap is a strong woven material, and it's both removable and adjustable from cross-body to shoulder. There's a single handle if you prefer to carry it like a case. The size is generous but not ridiculous. I can fit everything from my Big Purse in this one once I remove the organizers I usually use. There's a back pocket (just a little too small for most phones, sadly) and a little organization inside, but mostly this is a toss-it-all-in-the-middle sort of purse. (And obviously the shape doesn't work well with removable organizers.) It opens across the top about, oh, forty percent of the bag's overall circumference, so it's easy to access your contents.\n\nSo the shape and the organization might be a touch challenging, but overall this is a very useful, practical purse that would go well with just about any goth look, especially NuGoth.

Recently we went to a nearby farm to pick vegetables as a field trip and I took along the Vera Bradley  large lighten up campus two backpack. I have four kids and normally that bag is perfect. Well this time I was only going with one of my kids so I just needed a bag to hold my wallet, keys, cell, and a lunch and bottle of water. Well that bag was way too big and I felt silly carrying it. Soooo, I did some research and found this size Vera backpack. It looked exactly what I needed for those light day trips.  I love Vera bags because of the excellent quality. I own several, and have never once had a problem with zippers, construction, or fabric ripping on me.\nThis bag is bigger than I expected. It's quilted and padded and comes with adjustable straps. There is a magnetic closure on the front with two slip pockets underneath and one large slip pocket behind that. There is a zip pocket in the back and another one in the inside. A large pocket and ID slot under the flap in the front. When the base of the bag is folded out its pretty wide. I could easily fit my lunch, a couple bottles of water and my small all in one crossbody wallet, along with an iPhone six plus and both of the cosmetic cases fully loaded. I also love that it's got a padded rolled handle on the top for hanging or to easily grab. This bag could very easily fit under a seat on a plane with it crammed full to the max. It's also got two slip pockets on the sides for keys etc. I didn't  think a regular plastic water bottle will fit into those pockets, but was able to squeeze one in. And also on the other side I squeezed in a small Starbucks frappecino bottle. Just to see if they would fit. They do, but you won't be able to easily get either one out and back in again while having it on your back. I wish the two side pockets were a smidge bigger with elastic on the top like they are on the larger campus backpacks. I also bought the matching set of two cosmetic bags in the same Catalina blues print to use with this bag, and love them! I could put small snacks (granola bars etc) in the larger clear cosmetic, and use the smaller in the bag for my mommy stuff. I have enclosed photos with these two additional bad for reference and sizing. Colors are bright, vibrant, and you can wash it in the machine as long as you hang it to dry. Since I got mine in Catalina blues the coordinating pattern on the inside is in Catalina showers. The full retail price of this bag is $88. That is not what I paid.  Think I'm really going to enjoy this bag!", "summary": "Beautiful bag, great construction. awesome quality!", "unixReviewTime": 1458518400}

It really is a good concept and would be so perfect for running or walking at night or early morning if they would only stay on my shoes! I have worn these shoe clips for two mornings now. I clip them to the back of my shoes and they stay on for about 15 minutes, then they pop right off. The past  two mornings during mid run, the clips flew off my shoes and dashed across the street. This morning it happened right as a car was coming by and the car's tire narrowly missed the shoe light that went flying across the street. I have tried putting these clips on my shoes every way possible and I can not seem to keep them on my shoes. I ended up clipping them to the back of my waist band while I finished my run.\n\nLike I said above, these shoes lights are a good concept. I like the bright green light that can be seen from pretty far away. The button to turn the light on is easy to use and they are made of heavy duty plastic so when they hit the pavement they will not break. I know this from experience. If I continue to use these lights I will probably keep them clipped on my waist band.\n\n***DISCLAIMER*** I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.", "summary": "I like the concept but won't stay on my shoes!", "unixReviewTime": 1470096000}

This means dealing with dirt road traffic, which can be very fast.  Sometimes people don't see me until the last second even though I wear bright colors.  I have been thinking of buying shoe lights for awhile and was excited to give these a try.  They arrived quickly and I immediately unpacked them and snapped on my shoes.  First I made the mistake of clipping them on my shoes before I put my feet in and they slipped off.  Then I correctly put my shoes on and clipped the lights on second.  This worked much better and resulted in them staying in place.  They even stayed in place during my entire run.  They didn't appear to have moved by the running motion, either.  The large green button you can see in the product photo is a toggle button to turn on constant/turn on flashing/turn off.  I included a few photos of my pair.  (Couldn't get anyone to run behind me so you could see these in action, though!)  They are very bright and I believe a driver could see me from a good distance away--or at least understand something with flashing lights is moving ahead of them.  Of course, with these on the backs of my shoes, this won't help the crazy drivers in front of me, just behind me.  I hope the batteries last for quite awhile. Overall, I am extremely happy with this purchase!  I highly recommend.\n\nPlease note that this product was provided to me at a discount for my honest opinion.

I'm a lifelong athlete and I've been strapping these boobs down for athletic pursuits for about 23 of my years, so I am constantly on the hunt for the perfect sports bra. This is NOT IT. I wanted to love it, I really did. I ignored the red flags: None of the marketing ads showed women actually doing anything bouncy, all the women in the ads appeared to have breast implants (which is great, but totally changes what they need from a sports bra), and it appeared to have several of the problems I've encountered previously, which I will detail below. I ordered anyway, and I should have listened to myself. My current activities include running (bouncy), Jazzercise (super bouncy), cycling (less bouncy), and Crossfit (intermittently bouncy).\n\n1) Sizing: Women with large breasts on a comparably much smaller frame know that you need cup sizing in anything, including sports bras. Without cup sizing, it's always the same: if it fits my boobs, the band is too large. If the band fits, my boobs look like they're being squeezed out all around the bra like Silly Putty. So the idea of an adjustable band seemed like a great way to overcome this. I was on the cusp of two sizes, so I ordered the smaller one. I have the band as tight as it will go - no velcro left to go tighter - so I know I couldn't go up a size. The cups seem just a bit small, which means less bounce control.\n\n2) Bounce control: I was concerned when looking at the bra online that there is a lot of cleavage, which means there is not much coverage on top. That's fine if your breasts are mostly implants that are held down by the pectoral muscles, but natural boob-slingers know that they bounce up every bit as much as they bounce down. Well, I was right. There is little to nothing to keep upward bounce under wraps. SHEfit has fallen into the same trap many sports bras fall into: they rely heavily on shoulder straps to control bounce. When the straps are in H-back, we're talking pure earthquake-simulating chaos. Worse than my regular non-sports bras. When it's in X-back, I can get some decent control if I tighten the straps enough. But the straps are narrow, so it doesn't take long before they are cutting into my traps. So then I get to choose between tit-sloshing and bruised traps. I could not wait to get out of this thing after my workouts.\n\n3) Comfort: I've already addressed the miserable discomfort involved in controlling bounce, so here's what I have to say about general comfort. The base/band and cups of this bra are substantial. It's like wearing a \"device,\" not a bra. Which I would be fine with, if it worked. Just know it feels bulky and looks weird under clothes - the adjustable band sticks out under a shirt and so does the front zipper, creating a weird lump at the top of your cleavage. The band and straps adjust with a hook & loop closure, and no matter how I adjusted it the scratchy part kept finding its way to my skin. I ended my workouts with my shirt stuffed up under the band where the scratchy part was.\n\n4) Other: And speaking of the zipper... When I tried to wear the bra in H-back, the zipper lasted about ten seconds and then shot down to the bottom, releasing my tatas like floodwaters.

For reference, I'm 5'2, 32C bust, and wear a women's size 6, curvy and pear shaped.\n\nIt arrived as advertised and washes up nicely. It is listed to be a Polyester, Cotton, Microfiber, Spandex blend but has no tags to verify. It is soft with some stretch. I washed it cold, in a lingerie wash bag, and hung dry. Didn't experience any fading, pilling, or shrinking.\n\nI was surprised when I opened it because, considering it's low price, I thought it looked nicer than online and would be super flattering! I think on most women, it might be...\n\nI ordered it according to the sizing in the product description. I normally wear a women's size Small top and accordingly ordered this in a size Large.\n\nThe top fit nicely across my upper body (maybe not made for broad shoulders), although a little short in front, ending right where my pants start. It's not at all slim cut below the bust so it's not flattering if you want to show a small waistline. Maybe great on someone with smaller hips but not great on me...\n\nIt just seemed a bit too wide on the lower half to look good with my shape. If I'd gone a size smaller, it definitely would not have fit around the neckline or arm holes as this one fit snugly in those areas.\n\nI rated this 4 stars because it appears to be well made, I love the unique design, and there are no loose seams. I think it'd be super cute with shorts or a little skirt but it's not good (on me) with pants.\n\nAdding photos to reflect how it looks solid but is slightly sheer in the light. It's not see through but in a photo with flash would most likely turn out with undergarments revealed.\n\nWould recommend this shirt to others depending on their height and shape. Smile.

Almost all of the 5 star reviews for this bag are from people who have received it for free in exchange for a good review. I bought it with no discount. My review is unbiased as I paid full priced and was swooned into purchasing this awful thing.  That being said, I liked this backpack when it first arrived. It had that under the radar sleek vibe I was looking for. It was a bit small but I was willing to look past that because it seemed functional enough. However, my opinion of this POS bag they try to pass off as a quality backpack came to a crashing halt after the third day of owning it. The front Middle zipper broke with absolutely nothing in that pocket. It simply would not zipper up and remain secured. The structural integrity of the zipping device failed.  You get the point.  Indeed a cool looking bag both online and in person, yet the most important part of the pack, the zippers, are of THE WORST quality. Not worth buying for any amount of money. Since these guys care so much about their reviews and pretty much pay people for good reviews I will offer them this proposal. I want a full return with my shipping costs covered as well and I will take my TRUE honest and unbiased opinion or your awful backpack.\nUPDATE: There was no refund but they did send me a new bag free of charge.

One of those things is my backpacks. With all the books and equipment that I transport on a daily basis its important to have something that is going last me for a while and protect the things that I have in my bag. My books are worth way into the 600.00 range and the MacBook that I have at all times is a 1800.00 machine so I take what I have these expensive things in rather important.\n I have carried a lot of bags in my college career anything from regular big box store cheaper backpack and then name brand pack that cost me a pretty penny and not only do I think that this back pack met the expectations but also exceeded them in many areas. One of the places in which this backpack surpasses most pack is the quality of the pack itself. The material is very thick and made very well. The stitching on the pack is great and there was not a single loose thread on the whole bag.\n This bag has a lot of great little pockets and places that are built into the bag itself bit by far my favorite is the place that is able to hold my computer. Not only is big enough to hold my 12in computer but the back of the backpack is nice and padded so I don't have to worry about my laptop getting damaged in the pocket of the bag. The front pocket on the bag is nice and deep so that you can fit a lot of things in there. I have put in my stethoscope in there when there is nothing else in there and it fit it just right. There are also 2 great side pockets that are a perfect fit for a couple standard water bottles. There is also a couple pockets on the inside that are great for a cell phone or even a smaller wallet. The pocket on the very inside of the pack I have used for my keys or even spare change cause its big enough that its easy to reach into but small enough where it doesnt get in the way.\n Overall this is a great pack. Not only do the pockets in it make it very versatile and able to be used for not only school but as I did recently and took it on a hike. The material that its made of makes it nice and easy to wash. This is by far my favorite bag that I have owned yet.\n I received this product for free in exchange for my true and unbiased opinion. The opinions expressed in this review are mine and mine alone. No one or nothing has influenced my opinion. I in no way shape or form have a relationship with this dealer.", "summary": "Nursing student approved", "unixReviewTime": 1452643200}

I found this backpack, and I have been loving it so far, the size although not the biggest, is definitely suitable for most occasions, and can carry all the books and notebooks you need.\n\nIt has a main compartment, along with the two smaller pockets all of which are very nicely insulated to keep the inside a little more protected from things such as rain, the backpack also contains two side pockets that can carry a water bottle with a snug fit, but doesn't have much room to wiggle. The zippers and other leather parts are made of nice material and doesn't look like they will fall apart within a month.\n\nI really like the main compartment which has little sleeves to hold things like cash, electronics, and your wallet. It also contains a small zipper pocket inside the main pocket to hold you pencils, and such. The bottom of the bag has this support on the bottom to maintain its shape a little better, so it makes it easier to to put in your books, notebooks, and papers.\n\nOverall, its a really nice backpack for the same, and even a little cheaper than other backpacks from big companies such as Jansport.

I was ready to buy a new pair of free's until I stumbled upon these shows on amazon and fell in love. I have slightly small feet so I am down to buying kids sizes since they cost much less than adult sizes. So I decided to give the new boost foam shoes a try and this is my review:\n_________\n\nDESIGN: What can I say about these shoes. They are definitely a looker. The brilliant electric blue color along with the the well accented black and white really do catch your eyes and the eyes of others as well. I have no complaints about the design. I love the blue and they will be the envy of other runners in the track.\n__________\n\nCOMFORT: These are a bit heavier and more restricted in movement than my Free Runs but the flexible upper helps in increasing flexibility even though its not a minimalist shoe. This shoe is more of a hybrid between a minimalist and stability shoe. The ankle area is a but tight for me but I am easily adjusting to them. My biggest complaint as far as comfort goes is that they do end up getting hot in the long runs. Please be aware of this.\n___________\n\nCUSHIONING and PERFORMANCE: The boost foam is remarkably pleasant. It really does feel like memory foam for your feet but as far as making my runs more effective, I found no difference between these and my Free Runs which means the performance is great and definitely worth the price that they are being sold for. And the cushioning of course is phenomenal.\n____________\n\nCONCLUSION: I love these shoes and recommend these if you are considering them. Give them a try.", "summary": "First Time Buying Boost Shoes", "unixReviewTime": 1442620800}

I guesstimated which was which based on comparison from smallest to largest and they fit into the stand okay but some not sturdily.\n\nI tried using the set to remove some watch links but found that even the smallest one (shaped like a flathead) wasn't small enough. Many watches require something more like a pick to push out the pins.\n\nBoth the blades and the replacement blades are leaning towards a black color that looks like they're beginning to rust. One of mine were delivered slightly bent making it useless.\n\nIf the blades were good, I might overlook some of the other issues but they are key in the functionality of these tools ever being useful and pretty much junk.

They generously offered to send me an updated version of the dress, and I decided to take another look. I'm attaching a picture of the new dress in Navy so you can compare with the old design and see the issue I had a problem with was fixed.\n\nI said right from the beginning that this would have been a five star dress were it not for the zipper, and I absolutely stand by that now that I have that product in hand. Although it's not the color I originally wanted - black - the navy blue looks amazing on me, is incredibly comfy, and most importantly, looks great. I threw it on over gym shorts and my husband walked by and said it looked fantastic. It's a great look for the office - sharp and sleek, perfect for a meeting - and that's exactly what it will be my go to for. If I need to present something important, this is going to be the dress of choice for me.\n\nI have a lot of respect for anyone willing to admit they made a mistake and find a way to make up for it. The fact that the people at Ariana James admitted the zippered version of the dress was under recall immediately and offering to send an updated version to replace it very much impressed me. More importantly, they listened to feedback from reviews and fixed the problem in the dress design. That is something I can respect in any brand, and with that kind of responsiveness and willingness to listen, I am sure they will go far.\n\nAs it was explained to me, the colors that have been fully updated with the zipperless design are navy, green, and nude. Although the black has been updated, due to inventory issues, it's impossible to guarantee at this time that if you order a black dress that it will come in the updated design. In light of that, I still can't recommend the black version of this dress wholeheartedly. Still, if you decide to chance it, I think they will be reasonable with you (as they were with me) and try to work with you to get the updated version. If you decide to go this route, leave a couple of extra days in case you get the older version too.\n\nI'm leaving the original review intact below for anyone who is considering ordering this in black, so you're aware of what a recalled dress looks like. That said, the people behind this brand are reasonable and have attempted to recall the zippered version of this dress as best they can. If you do end up with a zippered dress, get in contact with them and see what they can do to help you. Based on this interaction and the updated version of the dress I received which fixed the zipper issue, I would still recommend this product despite the rocky start. The final product that I got - even with the journey around it - remains well worth the advertised price.\n\n--\n\nThis is KILLING me. I want to love this dress. It should be a great dress. It is comfortable and soft and falls a little longer on me - just above the knee, absolutely perfect! - and then I feel this weirdness on my left upper thigh and realize the dress is poking out there like some sort of awful arrowhead. Is it on the other side? Nope. Just the left. My left thigh looks like it could kill someone.\n\nYes, the thigh. It is exactly as weird looking as it sounds.\n\nIt fits perfectly, but I could murder someone with my thigh corner.\n\nIt is soft and cute except for that one corner on my thigh where it is stiff and weird.\n\nThe fabric has just enough give, like a t-shirt, to hug all my curves, except in the thigh corner where life is not curvy, but instead very pointy.\n\nI could totally wear this to the office and maybe rock this thigh corner as some sort of power move if there were two of them, but as it turns out there is only one thigh corner, and that's like wearing one shoulder pad.\n\nAt first I thought that perhaps this was a weird pocket placement issue, but I didn't find any pockets. I thought it must be poor sewing, but that was fine too. Once I realized it wasn't even symetrical I was sure it must be a manufacturing mistake. And only then - after taking the dress on and off several times with ease - that the left side has a zipper, and the difference in fabric stiffness between the shirt like material and the zipper backing was the issue.\n\nThis is the least necessary zipper in the history of zippers, including every zipper on every pair of pants that were sold at Hot Topic in the early 2000s. I can't stress enough how much I never needed or wanted this zipper with this fabric. A side zipper makes sense when you have fabric with very little give and you want a tailored fit. It is not just unnecessary, but actively detrimental on this dress. There were so many other options here - leave the zipper off entirely, put it in the back where things are nice and flat and you're not worrying about curves, choose a fabric with more body to it - and somehow I ended up with the worst possible design, an asymmetrical thigh corner.\n\nAnd this may seem like a minor dig, but this is a little black dress. There are so few elements here to screw up - and the flip side of that coin is that when you DO screw one up, there's no hiding it. As designed, this dress is unwearable on me, and it's not due to bad fit or it just not looking good on my body - this is purely poor product design that could have been solved simply by removing the zipper. I hope that the designer sees this and takes note, because I really, really want to love this dress, and I'm really, really mad that I can't. In the meantime, I'll be making an attempt to remove the zipper myself so I can actually wear this.\n\nSee photos, I wish I was making this up.\n\nI received this product at a discount in exchange for my review.", "summary": "Update: received the updated, zipperless design in navy and love it.

Living in Florida we go to the beach or the pool several times a week so I am always looking for cute cover ups. The main thing I really like about this one is that it doubles as a little jumper or mini dress as well. Many beach cover ups are completely see through so they pretty much can only be worn at the beach or pool. Since this one isn't it can be worn over my suit with a cute pair of sandals, and I can feel comfortable wearing it into a store or restaurant when we are done swimming.\nThe cover up is very well made out of 100% polyester. It is a soft and very comfortable material. The stitching is done well, and I have noticed no loose threads in the seams. I have washed it several times in warm water and tumble dried it on low, and it has not shrunk or faded at all.\nThe design is really cute in my opinion. It is a one size fits all which normally makes me a little nervous as I am pretty tiny. I am 5'5 and about 105 pounds. I normally wear a size X-Small or Small. This fits me perfectly, yet because of the drawstring waist there is plenty of room to loosen it up to fit other sizes as well. There is a deep V in the back with a decorative string that goes across the back and hangs down. It has brass or copper looking decorative engraved beads on it, which are also on the ends of the ties at the waist. The front has a smaller V. I tried wearing it the intended way at first with the deeper V in the back, but my problem was that the string with the beads that hangs down would always flip up every time I would bend over and hit me in the neck. It got to be very annoying. So I figured out that if I turned it around, and flipped the string over my head so it was still in the back it was much more comfortable, and I actually like the way it looks better. (I demonstrate wearing it both ways in my video.) I sometimes wear it off the shoulder, and sometimes wear it on the shoulders. It looks cute either way. I love this cover up and would definitely recommend it. I will probably be buying more in other colors. *I received this cover up at a discounted price for testing purposes, and for an honest and unbiased review. The opinions in this review are 100% my own based on my experience with the product, and I made no commitment to leave a positive review.*", "summary": "Love this cover up!", "unixReviewTime": 1466380800}

Even though its a small, I can see this fitting a size medium as well. The length of this beach over is great as well, it is not too long that it gets in the way, and not to short that you feel uncomfortable wearing it. It covers nicely while placed over the swim suit.

They remind me of the Lularue \"like butter\" leggings, but at half of the price. I received an offer to try these in exchange for an honest review. To be honest though, if I had come across them before, I would have tried them anyway with the Prime free returns policy and the super low price. So, the order arrived in two days and were packaged in a clothing bag within a mail bag with specific return instructions included. The first thing you'll notice is how soft / silky they feel, yet they're not thick and suffocating. I have true fleece pants that are so dense that I sweat in them even in cold weather. These breathe and are really comfortable. So, why only 4 stars? Well, they are OSFA, which means that they are stretchy and should fit the average sized person. I am 5'2\" and weigh 125, so small average. I expected them to be long and a bit loose. Yes and yes, so no biggie, but when I did the bend over test, they were a bit thin. No downward dog in these - unless you're going for that kind of attention. No judgement here. So then, why 4 stars? Well, they're leggings. Most, unless they're made for working out, are going to show your stuff if bent all the way over. That's why they're often paired with a tunic. They're SO inexpensive and if you decide that they're too thin in the back to comfortably wear in public, return them.

As a whole I am disappointed in this belt.

This doesn't give me confidence that the product will stand the test of time.  If I had seen it in a store, I would have put it back on the shelf after noticing this.  This belt is small! I made sure to measure my waist before ordering, but the holes stopped way too far from the end for me to wear it properly.  So it's pretty much useless to me.  It's a bummer as I was really hoping it'd work for me, because I LOVE the color (Lake Blue) and the fact that this is a fabric woven belt.  The fabric is even flexible and soft at that, which is good because I have sensitive skin.  Also, the buckle itself is heavy duty, sturdy, looks nice, and it's smooth to the touch.  But, the belt buckle isn't even in the same color family as the belt loop, which makes this belt look cheap.  The loop is dark brown faux leather, while the buckle has a brushed nickel look.  So it doesn't look like the picture.

{"overall": 5.0, "verified": false, "reviewTime": "09 28, 2015", "reviewerID": "A2WNWT7OO9L6QI", "asin": "B013UH0AYA", "reviewerName": "Geeks Fish Too", "reviewText": "Disclaimer:  I was provided this product in return for an impartial review. My views may not reflect the views of the company as I will not hold back if I see something wrong with the product.\n\nReview:\nVideo on YouTube: https://youtu.be/oeh3f7vFQ9U\n\nI received the accessory kit in very good time and it was packed well.  It came in a sealed large plastic bag that I had to cut open to get the product out.  There were moisture absorbers in the bag, though maybe not enough as you'll see below.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the quality of the plastic.  The quality appeared to be slightly superior to other kits I have purchased if not better in some ways.  There were no issues with plastic being molded wrong nor were there any \"dud\" parts that couldn't be used. The parts fits together well and everything worked without issue. There were some unusual things about the kit that I will detail below in the Pros and Cons but the most notable are the extra thumb screws and bolts, and the long bolts on the pipe clamp allowing attachment to large items.\n\nI have used the parts from this kit while kayaking the San Saba River here in the Texas Hill Country and I was fairly impressed.  I mounted one of the mounts on my Kayak using the two sided sticky pad and it held very securely without any issue even though the surface had a very slight texture.  It stuck well enough to where I felt that I couldn't easily take it off. The head mount strap was very secure and felt good on the head. The camera felt very secure.\n\nThere were almost no issues with this kit. The only issues I found were that the bag, though large enough to hold all of the plastic pieces, was not large enough to hold all of the harnesses and the plastic mounts, plus camera float. It is apparently designed with the idea that you'll only have with you the things that you need to carry. This is generally true so not that big of a deal and I still found it very valuable on our last couple of outings.\n\nThe only other thing I found wrong was that the screw/bolts on the pipe clamp were mildly rusty. It would seem that even though there were moisture absorbers in the bag, it wasn't quite enough. It is likely that this happened in the warehouse or during shipping overseas.  Maybe a couple more moisture absorbers would help stop this.  A little oil on the bolts should stop any additional rust though it should be re-applied after using in water environments.  You'll see in the video that it did not affect the use at all and is truly a minor issue overall.\n\nPros:\n- Excellent materials. No molding issues.\n- Includes items not found in other kits:\n  - Long screws on the pipe clamp. This is nice to attach it to larger items.\n- Accessory bag is large enough to hold all the small plastic pieces.\n- Wrench is included for easier tightening of thumb screws.\n- Many extra thumb screws/bolts included with spare nuts with them.\n\nCons:\n- While big enough for most purposes, bag could have been a bit bigger.\n- Bolts on pipe bracket were slightly rusty requiring a little bit of oil to stop the rust.\n\nI actually had to look to find anything wrong. Overall the product was very good and had features I hadn't seen in other kits. I will be using these accessories for a long time to come.", "summary": "Excellent Accessory Kit with everything you need for your next adventure!", "unixReviewTime": 1443398400}

The straps have rivet holes in them and the stitching is ok and looks like it should hold. It  matches the color of the fabrics. Depending upon your partners frame there may/may not be a noticeable difference of the fit. i don.t believe this should be worn above a size of medium especially if your partner has a long trunk.

I posted a message to the seller and asked if I could exchange the dress for an XL and never received a response. So I returned the dress and purchased at full price the next size up.  Knowing how the large fit (able to get it zipped but too tight to wear) I was sure the XL would fit. When it arrived to I tried it on. The XL was so tight that I could not get it zippered.

He wanted something a little flashy but still was durable for his outdoor adventures. I saw this watch and loved the appearance and practicality.\nMy package arrived on time and in a yellow envelope. The watch was packaged to prevent damage but is very disappointing as a gift. At this price point I expected for it at least to come in a box. It came in a cheesy plastic bag that really made it feel cheaper than it is. Once I got it out of the bag I found it had an extra layer of visquin to protect the finish which left the watch in perfect condition. It also came with easy to use instructions.\nThe design looks much better than I expected it is a beautiful soft black with not too much shine. The red accents combined with the black give a very modern appearance that allows him to wear it in a more casual or formal setting. The material felt to be a nice medium to high quality stainless steel, I love the clasp and it seems very durable. He said it is very comfortable on and the links did not tug on his hair or skin at all.\nA unique feature is that it has both digital and an analog clock on it, I like the analog gives a higher end appearance but my husband prefers military time so she has both. The watch itself is not suitable for swimming but is as they call it living waterproof. That is a huge must with my husband as he is always into something.\nOverall he is very pleased with his gift and it feels like it will hold up for a long time.

He loves them and they are the only accessory he wears. I told him to pick out a watch, my treat, and he chose this one. We have a big difference in taste but I have to agree this watch is sharp looking. When we recieved it in the mail it was so much better than I expected. The face of the watch is a lot bigger than appears in a picture but a feature I feel is in trend right now. This watch is both digital and analog. The band is a 2 centimeter black stainless steel and has a double butterfly buckle closure. My husband had to take out a few links in order for the watch to fit properly. There are more links than you would ever need but more is better than not enough. With there being extra he is able to replace a link if need be. The red accents of this watch compliment the black well. This watch is multi functional and there are four silver function buttons along with a black turn dial to set the analog time. It displays time digitally and analog. Other digital functions include an LED backlight, a stop watch, alarm with snooze function and display of the month/day and day of the week. It comes with an instruction booklet but took us a little bit to decipher how to use. The back of the watch has engraving by each button telling you what the function is. It is stamped on the back 30 m water resistant and professional waterproof. I'm not exactly sure as to what that means and the Amazon lisitng for this watch states it is not waterproof. My guess is if someone happened to pour water on you it wouldn't break down but that doesn't mean it's safe to take for a swim. This is just such a stunning piece that my husband is certainly giddy to have it part of his collection. It is heavy duty, appears veery durable and has been keeping time. I think it is listed at a very low price that is suitable for most budgets and is currently on sale for $23.99. I have seen watches of this caliber listed up to $100. This would make a wonderful gift for any man and for any occasion whether it be a Birthday, Graduation, Anniversary or even Father's Day. This watch would also appeal to many age groups\nI recieved this product at a discount for the purpose of my review.

Although not fantastic quality, for the price I definitely feel like i got a good deal on something that i can wear to work without seeming like it will fall apart or strangely stretch through the day..\n\nThe only thing is this being one size.. is.. kind of insane so warning for curvier folks! I'm 5'6\" and 118 lbs (usually S/M or 2/4 depending on brand) and it fits perfectly around my waist and hits right at my knee.. i feel as though i could definitely wear if i gain a little weight (which.. my weight fluctuates often so this is good for me).. but i can't see how it would be comfortable for someone who typically wears a few sizes larger than i do.. Still though, with free returns on a well-priced prime item you may just wanna take the chance cause it is adorable!", "summary": "Can't see how its \"one size\".. but worked for me and is adorable!", "unixReviewTime": 1521417600}
