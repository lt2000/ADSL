I made it right after I got them in the mail and judged them at first sight. But after spending a month and a half with these babies (in and out of the shower), I have come to appreciate their true value.\nThough I'm sure these sandals are made of something that's not exactly rubber, I am now certain that the material is not styrofoam. In the shower, they get wet and flexible on my feet. Also, they're good for just walking around the house. Though I haven't worn them outside since I don't want to risk using them anywhere but the shower. They still feel fragile to me.\n\nI stand behind what I said about these sandals arriving in slightly used condition. One of the logos on a sandal was peeled halfway off when I got it in a plastic transparent bag. Plus they used to smell really bad, giving off this powerful odor. But after constant shower use, the smell is finally gone. I'm glad that I can step in and out of the bathroom without having my bare, wet feet touch the floor. Although they're not the best, these are some great sandals. You have my word on that.\n\nBut I still think the guys selling this product should post more images of the sandals here. The only customer image (currently provided) is just not enough. It needs to be shown at different angles and in great detail. And they should post a comment about the horrible smell that comes with the sandals!\nSeriously! Do it already!", "summary": "For use in the bathroom and shower only", "unixReviewTime": 1383955200}

If the shirt LOOKS like this, then the XL should be awesome -- will update this review if the purchase comes out differently.\n\nUPDATE: Ordered Jun 5, Received Jun 16 (11 days). That's pretty quick. Can't promise you'll get yours that quickly. Wife wears US XS or Small - got in XL. I think it would've been better in L (but it's close enough and the style certainly allows to be worn a little loose). As some have mentioned in reviews of this shirt, the photo appears to have two different colors of green, but the green layers are the same color. Even though the layers does give it the look of having two colors, I think the photos in the ad actually ARE two different colors. I think this shirt may be a knock-off of the shirt photographed, which is probably higher quality and has better fitting pattern/cut. The consistent ruffling and angles of the cuts do not match dead on. It's a decent copy, which most knock-offs are, but I really don't believe it's the same product/quality.\n\nUPDATE 2: I found a place to order the AUTHENTIC garment -- it's WAY WAY better. Now that I know for sure this is a knockoff/fake/counterfeit, there's no way it will get more than a 1 star rating. The seller, incidentally, refunded 1/2 my money, but I wish now I had never purchased it at all. Purchase the real thing from Uoften dot com. It's called \"Chiffon Multicolour Tiered Sundress top Shirt Blouse Trend\".\n\nI'm downgrading from a 5 to a 2.

The jacket portion had two ribbon strings to.. i suppose tie it closed? Both of them were almost partially off the fabric fraying away from the jacket material. The skirt is velcro, and quite short..way too short to use as costume outside of the home. The emblem on the top and tie were attached via poor quality fabric glue and immediate fell off. The white elastic of the tie was dirty. I emailed the seller with pictures and never got a response. I found that most curious as they contacted me twice asking me to go through them if I had problems prior to making a review (I suspect they get bad review frequently) I did first contact them to see if they would remedy my disatisfaction, however as I said they never responded.\n\nSmall note on the sizes, as the package indicated their sizes are \"asian\" ones so smaller than the standard.

Got it about a week ago and have been using it daily ever since. There is a lot to like about this bag. It is relatively roomy. They did a darn good job making use of the space, with plenty of internal pockets. I have been using a Swiss Gear messenger bag for the last ten years, and the thing still looks brand new. The only reason I switched is because my girlfriend won't give it back to me. :) I also have a 511 messenger bag that is significantly larger. But I wanted something that was a little smaller than that, but could still hold all of my work essentials. The bag is stylish and looks pretty cool for the most part. I will say, though, that I expected a little more \"pop\" from Oakley. As cool as the bag is, it is incredibly drab looking. Just--black. They could have at least thrown in some highlight colors to make it a little cooler looking, but that is a minor complain overall. At this point, my only real question is that of durability. I certainly have no reason to suspect it won't live up to the daily grind that my Swiss Gear handled with ease, so only time will tell.\n\nThe only thing I really don't like about the bag, which I consider a waste of space, is that they took up an entire side of the bag with one of those luggage slip-over sleeves so you could attach it to your wheeled luggage. A good feature if you travel a lot, but for the rest of us it is a complete and total waste of space that could have been used for something else. The only other complain I have is the \"water bottle holder.\" I put that in quotes because I don't think it will fit the role very well. It can be tightened down, but it won't hold a very big bottle at all. Even worse, the pouch isn't very deep. Poorly designed. Other than that, a very cool, stylish, and great professional accessory!", "summary": "Great bag, if a little dull looking. Come on Oakley!", "unixReviewTime": 1531180800}

The seams of the lining are sewn towards the front and they protrude through the lace, which has wide spaces.

It seems you are wearing an apron, unless you are pregnant, in that case it may be OK. When I wanted to return this item, Amazon asked me to contact the seller, Fashion Mall.

As soon as she saw it, she was so happy. She wore it right away. Since you can have it custom-made without extra charges I found that convenient. It does come with everything you see in the picture EXCEPT for the boots, which is listed. The cape was well made, but some of the pattern of the back still had strings on it so we had to cut off those extensions, but it was an easy fix. The jacket (that's underneath the cape) was probably the best quality product in the whole outfit. It was made of pleather and the insides had smooth and slippery material, it has a silky feel to the inside. The shirt underneath the jacket was big but the neck was made kind of tightly. However, there are lace-up strings on the shirt (only about 3 on the right and 3 holes on the left for lacing up) that can help you loosen the neck area. The band around the waist kind of looks like a skimpy pleather skirt alone. You could probably use it for clubbing or something. It was longer than expected, but it was still made of good material. The white pants seemed a little light. They're kind of see-through and made of normal fabrics. By normal fabrics, I mean, the kind you can buy from Walmart and make baby's blankets out of. However, I believe that the thinness of this fabric does help to ensure that the straps (that hold the gear) are more fit to your body. The straps for the gears were kind of confusing. There were a lot of strange twists and turns but we had a friend help with those. It doesn't help that her legs were short and the gear is much longer than her leg. Overall, the cosplay looked great on her and she had a great time at the convention dressing up! I am satisfied with this product, but I would only recommend this outfit to others who are just starting out their cosplay career. Why? Because there are much better products (although they are more expensive) and it will give you a sense of how you feel towards cosplaying.", "summary": "Happy Sister", "unixReviewTime": 1391731200}

Each came with a black Mickey shaped back.  Individually wrapped in tiny clear bag.  Some doubles, but this didn't bother me since we are planning on trading and divided lot between 4 kids.\n To be fair, I've never seen a Disney pin before these arrived.  Didn't know anything more about Disney pins than what I read online. I looked for the obvious signs that these may not be official Disney pins.  These pins all looked good to me, but I didn't want to pass counterfeit pins, so we stopped at the official pin store in Downtown Disney in Florida to get these checked out before trading.\nWe pinned about 25 on each of the 4 kids lanyards and pouches that hangs from them, then we went to the store.  They had a board that had used trading pins on it so each kid could trade a pin.  Most of the pins on our lanyards were the same ones that they had on the board (so they are not rare).  While waiting in line, I spoke with the salesgirl who was helping us.  She checked out our pins (without taking them off of lanyards).  She said they looked real, but would have to check each out if we really wanted to know.  She looked at about a dozen off of the lanyard and thought they are official Disney pins and let us trade 4 for other pins from the trading board.\nGood enough for me.  My kids had a great time trading them all week with disney parks staff, Disney hotel staff, and other pin enthusiasts.\n\nOnly one problem with these pins.  It may be a problem for all Disney pins, again...I have no experience with this.  The backs of about a dozen of them fell off, resulting in lost pins.  After we lost the first few, we put our favorites INSIDE each zipped lanyard pouch so they wouldn't get lost.  (If we ever go again, I will purchase clear plastic pouches that zip, to hang from lanyards to hold the kids most prized pins that they want to show off, but not trade.).\nWe bought 4 of the cheapest pins we could find at Epcot for $7-$10 each.  They appear to have similar backs.  I would be upset if a dozen $10 pins got lost, but for the price of this lot, I'm really not mad.

This is not what I ordered at all. These nose rings are very poorly made. The stones fall off very easily and the nose ring itself breaks very easily. They have made half of them that the stone sticks out so far that it looks very awkward and ugly. I have used a few just as a spacer while I get new nose rings, but I would never get these again!

I have a smaller band size, but a larger cup size. I'm a 32DD, which is a difficult size to find unless you want to pay a lot of money, especially if you want wireless and cute. To give other women some idea of size, my cup size is the same as a 34D or 36C. I add this, because it seems a lot of reviews have only cup size & the size of cups varies depending on band size. So a DD on one person can look very different than the same cup size on another person. Anyway, I bought a dark green and royal purple. They work really well as sports bras, but they wouldn't work well for every day bras for me. That being said, I love them as sports bras! They're cute & comfortable with good support.

The bag is beautiful & I was able to fit my books & water in it & it was such a pleasure to walk down the street, no longer carrying my heavy shoulder bag. I was in happiness heaven.  Well today when I started out, I said to myself why does my bag feel like I'm pushing the shopping cart with the broken wheels?  So I decided to check out my wheels & found the answer to that question,  quick - one of my wheels were broken,  like about to fall off & I was so disappointed.

Speaking of which, the myriad buttons are a pain to snap up every time you want to wear the garment. It's a unique look but it's not very practical; this isn't a hoodie you can just slip on real quick and be on your way. Given the Asian sizing system, I ordered a Large for my Small/Medium American frame; it fits well with enough looseness to move, but the fit isn't as tight as the images would suggest. There's significant \"poochiness\" in the stomach section, so don't expect to look barrel-chested with a flat stomach while wearing this -- even if you possess that physique. I ordered the burgundy but the actual product is more of a bright crimson red; I'm fine with that but it's a discrepancy potential buyers should be aware of. I will give props for its warmth, however. The material is thick, relatively soft, and very toasty. The cuffs and bottom trim feature somewhat constricting elastic bands, however, which can be uncomfortable. The buttons are also somewhat feminine for a men's coat, featuring what more-or-less could be described as a flower motif.

Great deal! I got it sooner than expected and it fit great!\n\nI'm a slim athletic build and V shape torso. She based my size on the measurements listed on the sizing chart. It's fairly accurate. If you fit in the medium, and you're right at the top, it will fit like a fitted shirt not that baggy stuff a lot of people are used to. USE THE SIZING CHART.  Girls, if you're ordering for your man don't just believe him that he's a large. That means get your measurements. The cut of this jacket is slimmer than most.\n\nThe material is not stiff.  It's basically a dressy sweatshirt hoodie.\nFor me, it's a little baggy in the mid-section, but it fits me perfectly otherwise. It's very warm for a sweatshirt because of the double breasted front, and the hood is actually big enough to put on. Sometimes these Asian-made jackets have tiny little hoods, but that's not the case here. It's average. Someone complained about snapping all those buttons, to which I say, How long is a New York minute?  Longer than it takes you to snap those buttons, and WAY shorter than a SoCal minute.\n\nCONS: I got a red one. The bands around the cuffs and bottom are different fabric than the body. This means that as it is washed and worn, the two fabrics may fade differently. *Will update in future.\nAlso, this looks a lot like a regular hoodie from the back. If you're wearing it with nicer clothes, it will dress you down A LOT.  I've decided that adding darts to the back will dress it up a little bit.  PLUS, it will make it noticeably more fitted.\n\nVERDICT:\nIf you think you like it, buy it!", "summary": "Use the Sizing Chart - No big complaints", "unixReviewTime": 1397433600}

I don't usually stray from the Big and Tall sections, but this shirt got my hopes up when I saw it came in bigger sizes. Unfortunatly, this was not even remotely close to size. I know it says slim fit, but there is no reason this shirt should come up under big sizes at all. I fell in love with the look of this shirt when I first saw it and I usually wear a 3xl but decided to order a 4xl as I know shirts from companies that don't specialize in Big and Tall usually run small. The size is a joke. I wear a 19 to 20\" neck, a 36/37 sleeve, and sitting around my true waist (on the stomach) is a 52\". This not even remotly close to the advertised size. I expected it to be snug with the slim fit, but this shirt is easily 3 or 4 sizes too small in the chest alone. It seriously cannot be more than a large or xl, and it should have been advertised as a Tall Large. It nearly fits my shoulder width and arms when I put it on, and it leaves my entire chest exposed. With this sizing I would be wearing at least an 8 or 9xl just to fit their shirt. Maybe it was my mistake to expect it to be both \"slim fit\" and \"4xl\" but I don't usually associate 4xl with being this small.

The shorts aren't itty bitty, it covers my floppy upper arms, and the attached tie belt can be done in the front to help hide the tummy or in the back depending on your comfort level. And pockets! Plus its very flattering.\n\nI'm a little unsure why there is a zipper, unless it's for people who do order this on the smaller size who can't get out the surplice top, but I can just untie and pull it off.\n\nWhile plain (and sometimes boring) black, I can wear super cute sandals or gorgeous heels and jewelry and dress it up or down.\n\nThe shorts are baggy enough to do the pull to the side and pee if you girls know what I'm talking about. So you don't need to strip in a public bathroom unless that's you're thing.\n\nOne suggestion I learned from another romper I own, pick up a package of tiny snaps from the store and see them wherever you want to keep the surplice closed.

The cotton was soft and not scratchy which is another plus, upon receiving it, of course I had to wash it.  I was hoping it would shrink a little.  Looking at the reviews and sizing chart, I knew already to order at least a size or 2 larger than my US size.  I wear a large shirt (US).  So although the scale said US XL/Asia XXL (JPSK15), it actually fit like a large (US).  I suppose if you like REALLY tight shirts you can go one size large, but for a really good, form fitting, yet not super tight I would go 2 sizes up.\n\nNOW my main complaint.  The neck!  WAY TO BIG!  There is something totally not right with the cut of the neck, making it not only feel weird, but look a little strange.  A traditional Henley has a smaller neck, similar to a traditional \"T\" shirt.

That's craziness, in and of itself. It's probably the fastest overseas shipping I've seen, and I do a lot of ordering from the U.K. Secondly, the item was exactly as described, if not better than in the photo. While the photo shows some bulges in the fabric on the back, the costume shows no hint of such abnormalities when worn. I'm 5'1\", 130 pounds, and a size small fit like a glove (and a very flattering glove, at that--flared skirts, amiright ladies). It's not too short, either, which is important because there are no built in shorts like on TOS. Thirdly, the physical quality of the item far surpassed my expectations from the photos. It's made from a thick, cotton-y material that is very flattering and official looking, rather than the cheap, thin material often used in costumes from halloween stores. The stitching is excellent, and all the seams are neat and professional looking. Also, the blue costume is far more \"baby's blue\" than the more rich turquoise of the photo, which is definitely more true to the series.

Itd even drip. It was really nasty and my gauges began to be a source of self consciousness for me. Finally, I bought some scilicon tunnels. I thought theyd be softer and I wouldnt irritate my ears with movement while I slept. It was after a few days of the scilicon tunnels that I tried these again andwhatever progress Id made with healing was immediately reversed, and it was a worse reaction than ever!

I'll be honest that I was worried with a larger order of so many small items that the seller might forget one or two items when shipping, but they were all there when I got the parcel. Some of them do need a smidge of DIY TLC. Have some superglue ready in case of pieces falling off (trust me, pieces will never fall off again). Really, though, even with a little assembly needed for SOME of Yazilind's products (only 3 out of the 10-15 I ordered even needed any altering), you're getting some very nice jewelry for the price! I get compliments on my bracelets, necklaces, and wrist cuffs all the time! It's my little secret that they were less than $5 each! The only part of the pieces I received I didn't like was that the bracelets are lobster clamps - so hard to get on by yourself! I feel like pull ties would be much more manageable, and probably look better, too. I will probably find some threads for them and replace the metal chains on the bracelets with pulls instead when I get the chance. Other than those few small complaints, all the items I received from Yazilind were as pictured, comfortable, and very charming. I'd definitely suggest this item as well as other similar pieces in Yazilind's collection.", "summary": "Large Yazilind Order (General Review)", "unixReviewTime": 1453680000}

At the time they were one of the few bands with a girl and guy up front. The group had an average age of 19 years old. After being seen playing live by Tommy James he wanted to produce and write a record for the group. The record Tighter Tighter was a hit by August 1970. The band quickly wrote an album. Most of the songs are stage arrangements and some run longer then nesasary, but do show a unique style with five members who could sing. It is a great example of 1970s evolution in music as it departed from the 60s. The album was completed in one week and the producer could have taken a little more time, but Roulette Records was not a company to invest money. Unique songs like Kentucky Fire and Hitter Man have a heavy quality that could have had better production. The band had no say on the sound of the songs. The only Quality production is Tighter Tighter, and it's the only song produced by Tommy James. The band still performs with 2 original members 43 years later. Reviewed 6/13/13\nA side note. The original keyboard player married Donna Summer", "summary": "The forever one hit wonder", "unixReviewTime": 1371081600}

I don't know about you, but I saw a suit that had more pastel looking colors: lavender and sea-foam/light blues. I almost didn't buy the suit because I thought the colors were a little boring, but decided to make the purchase based on the price.\nIn reality the colors are more vibrant. What looks like lavender is actually a hot pink to fuchsia range and the light blue/sea-foam is a teal green. I think the color difference makes the suit much cuter and younger looking.

When the watch came back repaired, he got to wear it a couple days, then the same screw on the opposite side of the face frame apparently came loose and fell out while walking, so it was lost.

Here are the facts:\n\n- It's Paul Lorenzo suit\n- It's off black, which means, it's not the darker black, but about 95% on the black hue scale, more towards brown - this means when seen at light, it's still black, but not as dark. This is due to the material\n- Material is the scratchy sort of material. Polyester and Rayon.  I like this material, because it's comfortable without getting hot.\n- Inside is lined with black and red trims\n\nInitial fit:\n- Good. Jacket top fit well. But at 48 Regular, it was smaller than 46 Regular fit. But plenty of room in the arms, and good for athletic build. Me and my relatively wide shoulders fit in well.\n- The arm will be little longer  - for me anyway.\n- Pants had enough materials to cut it correctly, which is how the suits usually come, pre tailored.\n- It doesn't have any fancy stuff like on the expensive suit, but it wasn't built that bad.\n- 48 Regular suit pants came to about 37\" - 38\" waist. A tight one at that.\n\nI've spent about $70 tailoring it with a professional tailor.\n\nAfter Fit\n\nForgot about this: Note: Jacket Pants have 6\" drop.  Ouch. This basically means, even after you tailor it, if you don't wear this up on your belly button, your pants are going to feel like MC Hammer's pants, because all of the materials that's there. Most you can take off is about 1/2\" before the tailor has to rebuild your pockets, and re-make the pants (basically).\n\nEverything else fit very well.\n\nThis is a good, cheap suit for me to have on reserve just in case. It's a nice suit to go out drinking in, because I wouldn't really care what happens to it (if it gets out of hand, which it usually does).  Plus, it's a good beater suit.\n\nNot great, but not bad, especially at the price.\n\nObviously, you're going to advertise to the world that this suit is $60 or so, because guys who knows suits will know, but most people wouldn't think twice about it.", "summary": "$60 suit", "unixReviewTime": 1415750400}

Is it soft and pliable like Element 79 (Gold), with a melting point of only 1064 degrees C?  Or is it tough and durable like Element 74, Tungsten, with a melting point of 3422 degrees C?  It sure seems like Tungsten represents a durable long lasting love better than gold!\n\nYes, Tungsten is not just for lightbulb filaments, drill bits, and welding electrodes, but actually makes a reasonably attractive wedding band.  Especially for a man who might be a little rougher on his ring, the tungsten alternative is attractive, durable, and inexpensive.  This particular band is well made and comfortable to wear.  I actually like other tungsten bands I have seen, but really did not like the style of this one.  The outside of it is faceted, and the effect just makes the ring look too shiny and glitzy.  I'd prefer my ring to be more subdued - this one was so shiny it almost looked just cheap.\n\nIn addition, this particular manufacturer does not make half-size rings.  Since my ring size is 8.25, my size 9 ring ended up being way too big on me.  A size 8 would be too small, and tungsten rings are hard to cut off (just ask an emergency room doctor), so I didn't want to get stuck in it!  The problem is that with the high melting point, they cannot be resized either.\n\nSo if you'd like a durable wedding band and you fit well into a whole size ring, you can consider this ring.  However, if you don't like a glitzy and shiny style, it might not be for you either.  I'd recommend looking at other bands instead.\n\nNote: A free sample was provided to me by the distributor for evaluation with no promise of a positive review.", "summary": "Tungsten wedding bands are nice but this faceted design really doesn't do much for me - also not available in half sizes", "unixReviewTime": 1377302400}

I briefly considered the \"14K Yellow Gold & Black Enamel Crucifix Cross Mens Pendant\" because it's bigger and seems to have the same picture, but the cross with onyx would be higher quality than the one with enamel.  The cross I got was a disappointment.  The \"onyx\" is a thin plate that I didn't find attractive.  It does not have the little holes at the four ends of the cross.  Looking at it from the side, the beams seemed to have some depth, but turning it over one sees that the cross is of a thin plate that is molded to give the appearance of depth.  The back is open; there's no cover on the back to make it hollow, but closed.  I expected to see \"14K\" on the back, but it is not there.  So the cross is small and lightweight.

I cannot tell you the amount of tears I have shed while walking out of stores because I couldn't find a pair of pants that fit my body type. Years and years of this have passed and I stumble upon this brand of jeans. From the pictures the jeans looked perfect. They were flared, which the majority of stores I know of don't sell anymore because that's not the style to wear these days, they looked like they came to the right spot on the belly and the reviews weren't scary or off putting. So I crossed my fingers, wished upon a star,  threw imaginary salt over my shoulder and took a chance in ordering these jeans. When my jeans came in the mail I was a little hesitant to put them on. I got myself prepared for disappointment...I took a deep breath, put my feet in and was expecting to do my usual \"Pants Dance\" to wiggle them up past my hips. And I could not believe it...NO PANTS DANCE! They slid right up my legs, past my hips and went straight to their designated spot on my waist. No sucking in to button or zip them and infact..they were about a size TOO BIG! From the reviews I read, I was prepared and ordered them a size smaller than what I usually wear. And even with me ordering a size smaller..they were still a little big. But it was an easy 5 minute fix with my sewing machine and they ended up being PERFECT! In fact...I just received my second pair that I recently ordered because I recently lost a lot of weight and I don't want to go to any other pants. I love them!!\nI ordered these to be \"inspiration pants\" for me to lose enough weight to fit in them. Well..looks like I'll need to order another pair because my inspiration pants ended up fitting me perfectly. And a little added bonus..the way the back of the pants are made make your butt look FANTASTIC!! I put them on and showed my husband my new pants. I have NEVER seen his eyes pop out of his head that far before! He may love them a little big more than I do. lol But with all the good there is 1 thing I CAN complain about. My only complaint is that the material on my 2nd pair (Mariah) seemed a little bit thinner than my 1st pair (Katy). Besides that..I'm super happy and would recommend these pants to everyone.", "summary": "My \"go to\" jeans", "unixReviewTime": 1391904000}

I've been looking for a way to slim down my wallet and have looked at many, and read dozens of reviews. When this new Allett Lux was just announced, I decided to give it a try - and couldn't be more pleased. It's the size of my passport book, and appears to be beautifully made. Very nice leather with turned and well stitched edges and reinforced corners (extra stitching), and the wallet is lined in rip stop nylon. The design of the wallet is every bit as functional as has been described by Allett - and it's perfect. I have 12 cards in the wallet now, including credit cards, global entry card (in its own RFID blocking envelope), insurance cards, drivers license and car registrations and a couple of pictures of my kids. It all fits nicely - easy in and out, but nothing falls out. The wallet remains slim and flat, looks elegant, and is surprisingly easy to handle and use throughout the day -- it took me all of 5 mins to get used to holding he wallet differently than my old bifold when I take out cards or cash. The large opening at the top is divided -- a shallower side is perfect for bills, and the other side is the full depth of the wallet is great for receipts. I'm on day 3 with this, and and I'm extremely pleased. No more wallet bulge - fits front and back pants pockets and lays flat -- dress pants or jeans, and fits my suit jacket lapel pocket perfectly as well.\n\nI'm extremely pleased with this. If it holds up well over time, this will easily become my favorite wallet.\n\nUpdate - after 2 years of use, June 30, 2017:\n\nI've been using this wallet daily for the past 2 years since writing the original review. The wallet still looks great, and has held up well. All seams are intact, all linings are still in place, and the wallet still looks great. I've gotten in the habit of flipping it over periodically, so both sides get about equal time facing in toward me in my pocket and facing out. This has kept the wallet from assuming any particular curvature, so it still lays nice and flat.\n\nOverall - it's virtually like new. The ONLY issue I've had is that after two years, I'm finding that some of the cards (e.g., my Drivers License) tend to get a bit stuck in the wallet when their smooth plastic surface is up against the leather interior inside a card slot and the whole thing gets pressed together sitting in my pocket for hours on end. I didn't notice this over the first year -- not sure if it's the leather getting sticky, or the drivers license itself, or a result from me having several cards in each slot these days. Not a big deal, as it just takes a wiggle occasionally to get the cards to slide out.\n\nThe only visible wear is a bit of curvature on the edges (to be expected), and where cards have embossed numbers, they have tended to impress themselves a bit on the leather, as can be seen in the photo I'm adding to the review. But the photo actually exaggerates this -- this is virtually invisible without the camera. Note - this is the wallet after two years of daily use.\n\nAfter decades of buying wallets -- including very expensive / high end leather goods from Italy and the like, this is, without question, still my favorite wallet. I have zero interest at this point in looking at other wallets, and I still marvel that so few companies have adopted a similar design, as this is virtually perfect.\n\nHighly recommended.", "summary": "Best wallet I've owned - brilliant design - excellent execution", "unixReviewTime": 1430611200}

They sent me a confirmation, letting me know they were changing my shipping to next day and I got the suit earlier then needed! Good material, great service and an overall really good deal.

The shirt was ugly, extremely large, baggy, square shape, wide sleeves, did not fit to the body at all. It became clear when I noticed the tag was also different from that which was in one of the web photos. So I wrote to the seller with a return request and demanded my money back (sent them also the photos). They were willing to refund the price of the shirt but not the shipment (which was over 20 dollars !!!) and were so \"kind\" to let me keep the shirt. Their argument was I should not have purchased on the base of customers reviews and they said they had the right to change the brand.\nAfter that I claimed directly at amazon.com and insisted on my statement that I  got a different product from that I had ordered and sent them the pictures to prove that.

I am a 38C w 44\" hips.\nAfter seeing the skinny little model on the YouTube videos (show some great ways to wear the dress but shes a veritable clothes hanger) and in pictures I was concerned about having enough fabric to cover my full figure on top.\nI do have to put the dress on over my head, but it works beautifully for a full figure. I would say that you should probably buy the tube top if you aren't comfortable going braless. There are some backless strapless bras that will work too. Tube top or not, the scarf style top has plenty of fabric to cover a full figure without leaving that horrible side boob then nobody wants to see...\nAt my height the dress does drag the ground a bit but with the unfinished edge you could always cut it if you wanted to. I have left it because it looks great and flows beautifully. The fabric is thin but not ultra see through with a print, though I can imagine if you purchase this in nude or yellow or white it would be.\nEven with my size, the dress does not curve back in around the hips, it's more of an A-line maxi...which is great!

While I received this dress by the expected delivery date [thanks to Amazon Prime], that was the only good thing about this online purchase. I ordered the Gold Metallic VonVonni Women's Transformer Dress, not the gold with the animal print, just the regular one. The description of Gold Metallic with the picture of the gold metallic dress was nothing like the product that was sent to me. There's nothing shimmery gold or gold metallic about the dress I received. The dress I received was more of a champagne color and small gold glitter. It didn't look nice when I opened the bag it was sent in, but I tried it on hoping it'd look decent on. Unfortunately, it wasn't even decent looking when I tried it on. I'm a size US 4 or EU8 in most brands and even I found this to be way to big for me, I don't know how anyone smaller me (like a size 2 and smaller) could work with this dress especially when this dress is meant for anyone that are within the size range of 0-12 (one size fits all). I'm most disappointed about the color of the dress not being what the description on the webpage states it to be. I'm also unhappy with how they cut part of the dress too, if you've read the other reviews about this types of dress from VonVonni good or bad, you figure that the dress not hemmed at all, which is understandable seeing this dress is suppose to be convertible, however parts of the dress I received was cut so badly that you could see wear they stopped and started a new cut in the fabric (very sloppy looking). Due to those issues, I sent the dress back indubitably to VonVonni, I did not like the dress VonVonni sent me.\nAlthough I've only had negative things to say about the dress I received, I can honestly say that the actually fabric felt nice (had good weight to it, jersey-like material) and was decent for the price they charge. I don't believe that this dress is nice in the lighter colors (like the one I ended up getting) because of the fabric there's a risk of it being see through and/or you will be able to see any flaws in craftsmanship if any. But I think the dress could be worn beautifully in the darker colors and the brighter colors options (flaws will be less noticeable and the fabric would look better in those types of colors).

Comfortable. I sized up because I was going for around-the-house comfort and I have a sensitive waist. Fine as pj bottoms.\n2. Washes well. I followed instructions and they came out fine.\n3. Nice thin, stretchy material. I don't get why some reviewers called these heavy or too warm.\n4. Pockets. They're patch pockets and not big or sturdy enough for anything heavy (e.g., phone or wallet), but I always welcome pockets.\n\nCONS:\n1. Clearly the length is inconsistent, based on the reviews I've read. Mine, which are size XL, had a 32-inch inseam before washing and drying (per instructions) and 31 inches after. A little shrinkage in length is to be expected. I'm 5'5\" and for me they're a tad long as barefoot pj's/lounge pants. That also makes them problematic for yoga class.\n2. Long rise, at least in this size, which contributes to them dragging on the floor.\n3. Cheap drawstring construction: You can see the white elastic band through the raw holes for the string (which doesn't match the pants color).\n\n$29 is the upper limit of what I'd pay for these pants. The gray ones are currently going for $39, and that's a definite no.

It is a somewhat more muted pink than shown in the picture.  There is only one size, and there is no stretch.

So it is a little large on me, and I installed the padding, and it fits okay.  Not like it would if it was sized specifically for me.  As far as what to wear it with... originally I got it to wear with a pink outfit, but I find that pinks are ridiculously hard to match and vary widely based on the material used.  This is kind of a baby pink, and the pink outfit is more of a bubblegum pink.  So I don't wear them together.

This is a high-quality swimsuit, very flattering and well-constructed.

At the first wearing, it did seem snug as I was putting it on, but now I realize that its supposed to. Its almost like a compression garment, thats how powerful the Lycra is in this suit - which is wonderful for a fitness swimsuit. I suppose if you were getting it more for a recreational/leisure swimsuit, it would seem too tight and youd want to size up.

Im really very pleased with this purchase and would recommend using the same seller. I also would advise looking into the Noppies brand I'm very convinced that their other products are probably just as awesome if not better than the night gown I got today.

I ordered both the white and blue blazers. I'm a regular US10, slightly curvy (bust 36\" & hip 39\"), ordered the large & fit is spot on. Soft, cool on the skin material, well tailored & good quality. Material is polyester with no stretch to it. This blazer is short, back-end rests right above the behind, and hence the image is slightly misleading in this aspect. I can tell the style & shape of this blazer is not made for all body types, and certainly not for short torsos, wide hips, thick arms or large busts. So, if one's body shape is short triangle, round or heavy pear, this blazer would fit awkwardly, be unflattering or not fit at all. The blazer have shoulder pads, that can be easily snipped off (which is what i did, to get a more relaxed look). Just like another reviewer mentioned, it's not comfortable rolling up the sleeves, becomes snug. The white blazer is true white with bright yellow, and the blue is more royal blue than regular blue with bright yellow. Looks great both zipped up or down. I would have preferred an inside button, and actually considering getting one tailored in. I like the versatility of this blazer which can be worn casual (with jeans, shorts) or semi-formal (with a fitted dress, pencil skirt, a-line, office pants). I'm very fond of these blazers, and would recommend them if you're looking for a fashion blazer at a very fair price, while keeping in mind observation towards body shape.

This hoodie has the shepra-like lining in the hood, which I was looking for and the rest of the hoodie has the same thickness as you would find purchasing a hoodie from Old Navy or similar store.  The fit is long enough to cover my torso and bottom.  I also purchased two sizes up from what I would usually buy.  I'm typically a size small so I ordered a large and it fits fine.  Things to note for perspective buyers: 1: There are more than one manufacture of this same hoodie and many are different quality and price.  This one by DJT is thicker and better quality.  The hood is shepra-like and not faux fur.  The zipper is also of better quality.  The only lining is in the hood and no where else.  2.  The size still runs small but not as small as other the knock-offs of this hoodie.  Buy two sizes up and you'll be fine if you want a movable fit.  If you like it more form fitting and then buy only one size up.  3.  Everyone is using this photo to display this product but it is hard to tell which product you'll actually get from certain buyers.  I purchased this exact same hoodie from Poshmark and it was a cheaper and poor quality product.  I also paid $25 more.  The product was made by Finejo and the fabric was so thin I could see through it.  The hood lining was faux fur and the zippers where cheaply made.  The fit was also very small even though I ordered two sizes up.  I returned it right away.  4.  If you only like the look of the side zipper but don't care about thickness or quality you can buy this hoodie from Fred Meyer (if still available) for $10-12 but will only be suitable for teenagers who are only looking for style vs function.\n\nOverall if you are looking for the better quality of this hoodie and not the cheap knock off version then buy this one by DJT.", "summary": "I'm typically a size small so I ordered a large and it fits fine.

I glued a big bouquet of feather plumes behind the bow for added height (next to the crown with the bow covering the base of the feathers).  Next, I pinned a large burgundy fabric rose to the center front of the crown.  Last , I unglued the headband, moved the hat further down the headband and reglued.  I ended up with a super stunning pirate fascinator!\n\nBy using this inexpensive hat as a base, adding some odds and ends, my pirate hat now looks like an expensive custom  made expensive fascinator.

I think it is a decent functioning watch winder and it will keep your watch wound but, it can look a little cheap and can be a bit hard to use at first.  So if you purchase this, it is only fair not to compare them to the ones that cost hundreds of dollars.\nLooks:\nIt is plastic.  There is no see-through cover to keep out dust.  It is black and silver (maybe gray).\nUse:\nThe directions are not good and basically just gives you the regular legal disclaimers and tells you how to turn it on and not take the watch out while the winder is on.  The winder has a center which you can affix the watch to.  You can take it out by reaching in with your thumb and index finger and squeezing the sides and gently pulling out with your fingers.  I thought this was not good for people with thicker fingers (especially with the adaptor for bigger watch faces on).  Later I found out that since the winder is slightly flimsy, you can actually just push the center to a side and the bottom on one side unhinges just enough for you to pull it out.  The center comes with a adaptor for watches with bigger dials.  You can remove this adaptor for watches with smaller dials.  Both have small velvet stickers to keep the back of the watch from scratching against the plastic directly.  You can secure your watch around this center which has a plastic piece with a spring inside that adjusts to the size of the wristband.  This watch winder turns clock-wise and counter-clockwise.  There is no setting for time variations.  The winders have been in use for a few days now and they do the job and are keeping my automatics from stopping.  I have not had to wind them so far.  They are fairly quiet except one of mine makes a slight noise when it goes clockwise.  I let it go counter-clockwise and the noise stopped.  One of the winders was defective as it would not turn, but Jomashop was quick to issue an RMA as soon as I informed them.", "summary": "Not for displaying just for winding.", "unixReviewTime": 1303948800}

The amazon website stated it would ship in 1-2 days. MACRO did not intend on shipping it for at least 10 days! I had to cancel my order which was a disaster. The company never once returned numerous phone calls and emails I left with them. I refused delivery of the item and MACRO never credited my account for it! In the end, my credit card company had to dispute charges with them. It was a huge headache! Very dissapointing company, to say the least. We ended up using a different website to purchase the product.\n\n  Now, let me say that I really like the sit n stroll! I used it on a vacation that I went on alone with my 14 month old. Make sure that you call ahead to the airline to see if the plane isle way is wide enough for the sit n stroll. My plane was small, so I had the pilot actually carry the sit n stroll onto the plane for me. The stroller is way to heavy to carry with one hand! I would not recommend using this item as an everyday stroller, it does not feel that sturdy. After my trip, we placed it in our second car and use it only as a car seat. It is a good item for the money. Things that I didn't like about it ... nearly impossible to lift from a carseat position into a stroller with my 23 lb. daughter inside. I needed another person's help for that. The catch on the back is sharp and I cut my hand twice trying to use it.  Also, there is really no storage space under or behind the actual seat - again, I would not recommend this as an everyday stroller.\n\nGood product, bad vendor!!!!", "summary": "Good product, bad vendor", "unixReviewTime": 1114560000}

I prefer the \"nerd style\" flip up ones like this one because you can flip them up to see normal and down for diffraction effect.\n\nPros\n-Low cost\n-Much preferred over paper ones\n-Fit comfortably\n-Won't dissolve in the rain\n\nCons\n-For some reason both the normal lense and the flip up lense are both diffraction - unlike my other pairs where the normal lense is just clear plastic and the flip up lense is diffraction. This may sound cool because you get double the diffraction!... but in reality one diffraction lense makes it hard enough to actually see things around you - two makes it practically impossible. Looking through both makes it so really all you can see is light pigments, without being able to make out your hand infront of your face. That being said I found it was preferred to just have one diffraction lense, not two. To solve this, I popped the lense out of the fixed part of the glasses so when flipped up you can see normal and when flipped down you get the diffraction effect. I ended up using the extra lense that I popped out over my cell phone camera for cool video effects. It would be cool to incorporate this into a cell phone case.\n\nOverall it worked as I wanted it to. I would love to see a product like this that allows me to rotate the lense while I wear it so that the diffracted image can move without me having to tilt my head.

I was looking for something that wasn't too thick since I'm pregnant during the summer but had high quality fabric and wasn't see through.  There leggings are made out of a nice fabric that doesn't seem like it will snag and they don't appear to be see through in any way.  The panel does seem just a tiny bit big but I'm sure it will fit in a few weeks (I'm currently 6.5 months pregnant.) I  was hesitant to buy these since they were pretty expensive but they are a great quality and even though they are marketed as active pant, I feel confident in pairing these with long tank or tunic and wearing it out, not just when I am being active.  I don't know how these will do postpartum as when I tried to roll the panel down, they got a bit weird in the back because of the design but I'll probably wear them anyways, at least while I am at home and on maternity leave.", "summary": "Finally, a quality and well fitting pair of maternity leggings!", "unixReviewTime": 1531094400}
