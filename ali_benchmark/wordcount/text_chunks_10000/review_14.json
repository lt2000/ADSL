No bunching at the waistline. When I put it on and pull the elastic all the way out, it extends about 4-5 inches out at which point it's taught.\n\nJust FYI, the elastic waistband is not tight but it's not quite a medium tension either. At the same time, it's forgiving because of the width of the waistband (which is 1.25 inches wide). So, give or take. You judge based on your wardrobe and what works for you.\n\nI hope all that's helpful.

It was very flattering to my figure. The chest area is well padded, so a bra is not required, however because my chest is not very large (I usually wear a 36B) the dress did not look good without one. Someone with a fuller breast would probably not have this problem. Without a bra, the dress basically hid my breasts and looked a little saggy, so the lift a bra provides was necessary for the dress to work on me.\n\nThe sleeves are only attached to the band below the breast- I easily held the sleeves in place on my shoulders with some double sided tape on my bra straps. I was also able to easily hide my bra in the back underneath the dress- the dress can be pulled up in the back to cover it and another small piece of double sided tape ensured that the back of the dress would not pull down throughout the night. With a black bra and a black dress it's not so imperative to hide every piece of the bra, but with a different color dress you'd have to be a bit more careful unless your bra color perfectly matched the dress. The sleeves and padded chest area can be adjusted to cover a bra completely, so this is not an issue at all.\n\nI'm not very curvy and the dress managed to accentuate my hips quite nicely.

So I will see then if the locking mechanism is stable enough to endure the tumbles of daily life.\n\nUPDATE:\nAfter wearing the earrings for one day, one of them broke in half...\nThought this would happen given how thin the earrings were.

I've tried wiping and spraying with vinegar, spraying with perfume, dryer sheets, etc. but the smell is still there.

The first time out with it I was complimented on it. I bought the coffee one and true to color. Very rich. Zipper pouch on the outside,fairly small.

It is large enough to carry one or two note books or a small laptop, which mine is not so mine won't fit. It is a wonderful \"movie purse\". It will fit everything you need plus more and not looked over stuffed.\n\nThe only thing I do not like is the pockets. There is one zipper pocket on the inside and for such a large purse it is very small. There are two pockets on the inside but they are useless because they are only 2-3 inches deep and nothing, not even my chapstick will stay in them. And lastly there is one zipper pocket on the out side, and it two is rather small for such a large purse and it kind of in an awkward spot thats hard to get to unless you set the purse down. I have yet to find a purpose for the zipper pocket on the outside.\n\nSo if you are looking for a good size tote then this will work for you but if you have to have functional pockets them I recommend looking for a different purse.", "summary": "A great purse.", "unixReviewTime": 1398988800}

It arrived earlier than expected and came out of the packaging nicely. I heard others complain of an odor, but I did not experience that. First time ordering from this retailer and was unsure what to expect. I am 5'4\" and 130lbs. I normally wear a size 6/8 in Misses and a size 9 in Juniors, size medium in Juniors tops and size small in Misses tops. I ordered a medium in this shirt because I was afraid it would be too small. The medium is a tad bit too big, especially in the shoulders, which have a little puff to them. I would have absolutely LOVED this shirt if it was the correct size. So if you are unsure whether to go with a small or medium, size down. I will not return because I don't want to wait for another product or deal with a return, but I will be washing and drying item to see if it shrinks the fabric a bit. Nice material, and the lace is exactly as pictured. Has a nice length to the hem, hits about hipbone area on me, but the sleeves are a tad bit long. Again, hoping it will shrink a little in the dryer and fit perfectly.  Good for the price, but if it doesn't shrink in the wash, I will be giving it to my friend who would fit in it perfectly.

It solves the biggest #firstworldproblem I incur where to put all my stuff when dancing and wearing a dress! I ordered the smallest one and I'm petite, only about 5'2\" and 120ish pounds, but it barely wrapped around my leg, so I would suggest going up a size as I'm pretty sure my thigh isn't considered huge. Part of the problem may be that under a mini length dress, it needs to go up really high on the thigh or it would show. Reaching up my dress to access my credit card and ID is a little awkward, but it's definitely way better than carrying a bunch of junk around in my hands, stuffed in my bra, or constantly losing track of my purse and being worried about sticky fingers getting into my bag. I definitely recommend this product and all of my friends were totally wowed by it as well. The velcro is strong and the grip was pretty decent.

It's hard to describe if you aren't holding it in front of you.  Essentially, when I tried to dig out my money, ID, or anything, I found myself awkwardly fumbling all bent over digging into this garter unsuccessfully.  My hand kept ending up between the lace and the lining, rather than between the 2 layers of lining, which is the pocket.  I eventually got tired of hunching over and digging around my thigh, (because I looked so ridiculous) so I just gave up and took it off to get my money out of it at the bar.  Yeah, not so sexy or smooth.  I'm guessing that the pockets are designed this way to prevent things from falling out, but it also makes it nearly impossible to access while it's on your thigh.

I have had it for over 90 days and I like it so much that I had come come by and update my review some more.\n\nThe quality of the leather this wallet is made of is incredibly good. The color has remained on the wallet as if it were the first day. the wallet, despite of me abusing it has remained brand new. Great to carry all the stuff you need for your daily life. I am a New Yorker and I like to carry as little as possible.\n\nThis is perfect for my subway card, my debit card, two credit cards, my employer ID and my drivers license on one of the special compartments.\nI also carry some cash. I'm not a cash guy so I usually carry about $20 worth of change consisting of: 1 $10 bill, 1 $5 bill and 5 $1 bills this wallet, as compact as it is, has room for more but that is all I need to carry and it fits it well.\n\nThis wallet is super light weight and so thin that you can berely notice that I have a wallet on my front pocket... No more wallet in the back pocket for this guy.\n\nQuick heads up and take note of this. If you are planning to go out and get drunk... really drunk, I recommend leaving this baby at home and carry something else. I used to carry my old Military ID card and during a drunken night of fun, I got stopped by the police and while trying to take my DL out of the wallet, because of the zipper and the alcohol, everything fell out and that resulted on me losing my old army ID card... which sucked because that was a nice thing to carry and show people. There is nothing wrong with the wallet, it was my fault for being drunk, but as advice to anyone planning to purchase this wallet, leave it home with your car when you go out for drinks.\n\nI stay a strong fan of this product and I would reccomend to anyone. I am looking into getting the more premium water resistant one. Smart investment you'll be making.\n\n____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nThis is the perfect wallet for a man and I'm constantly swimming in compliments about it.\nIt gets 5 Stars because it has everything that you would expect in a wallet. Its amazingly compact. There's enough room for everything you need on this thing. The leather seems good quality and very durable. It is also stylish.\n\nI would definitely recommend it if you're looking for something small, Stylish, reliable, good quality, easily accessible and that will make your friends both men and women jelouse of you.", "summary": "The perfect Wallet", "unixReviewTime": 1401926400}

I have cut my card stash down to seven with a few very thin card-sized items, but for me the issue was that it was too difficult to fold banknotes (bills) into thirds and stuff them into the side cash pocket. The cash pocket is soft fabric and it yields when you try to insert more than a few bills. Two hands were needed to get the money in. That was a concern because fumbling and hesitating when putting money away is not a good idea.\n\nI tried flipping the recommended directions using the center section for cash, but the side cash pocket is a few millimeters too small for cards, making it tricky to close the zipper. What a shame because it looks and feels great. If only that cash pocket had been stiff leather instead of thin fabric.\n\nBecause it was such a lovely item I will try the Bellroy Slim Sleeve, but I will seek it out in a store so I don't waste shipping etc.", "summary": "Beautiful and a great idea, but I returned mine.", "unixReviewTime": 1392076800}

You can't beat the price-- I have lost quite a few earrings, so if I lose any of these, it won't be so bad because they're so inexpensive. 5 stars from me!\n\nUpdate--- still have them!

That really disappointed me, so i tried to do something about it. This is what i did.\n\nI took everything out of my wallet, then i put the wrinkles/folds on top of the steam coming from my kettle, what it does is it softens up the materiel, you can rub the wrinkled area with your finger if you want, but it won't help to much. Just don't hold it under the steam to long or it will start melting. After that i wiped away any drops in the wallet and let it dry for a little. Then i took the wallet and aligned it to its proper place and what i did was overnight put a bunch of texts books over it, and a 10 lb weight on top of them all. i woke up and the wallet wouldn't open when laying on flat surfaces, the wrinkles were gone, and the wallet became just what i wanted. But i recommend when you put text books on your wallet, keep all of your stuff IN your wallet, so it may form its alignment to your cards/money. Also try sitting on your wallet, in your back pocket.

One day, he saw his brother whip out the \"perfect\" wallet...thin and sturdy.  It was the Allett. So, my hubby purchased his first one that was made out of material rather than leather.  He had the Allett for years and was extremely happy with it.  But, alas, it eventually fell apart.\n\nBeing a professional, he needed a more \"professional\" looking wallet, so I bought him the leather Allett for Christmas.  Quite frankly, I was a little scared because I didn't know how a leather wallet could be \"thin\" and was concerned by hubby wouldn't be happy with it.  However, upon opening it and now having used it for 2 months....he loves his leather Allett.  It fits comfortably in his pocket, is well made and sturdy.\n\nMy husband carries 2 credit cards, his driver's license, cash and an ATM card.

Perfect setting here, which adds to it's \"believability\". I was hoping to find a ring I could wear with my wedding band, I'm so in love with it, I might keep it anyway... It also has pretty decent weight, so you even feel good wearing it. I also included a photo of this ring next to the Amazon Collection 2 ct solitaire and you can see how much better the cut of this stone is. The sizing is a little roomy, if you're in between sizes, you can comfortably size-down.

But I liked how my trifold held my cards. Since they go in long ways, there's enough of the card sticking out that you can get a good enough press with your finger to slide them out, you don't have to pinch the edge of the card to get it out. Most bifolds I tried/saw, had the cards barely sticking out by a sliver that you have to pinch to get them out. This wallet has the card stick out enough that if I put it in upside-down, the raised letters of my name stick out, and thus act as a grip so I can slide the card out. Much easier to me.\n\nThe outside slot has the removable card holder, which I don't use. But if I keep the removable part in, I can put a card in the outer slot of the wallet between the card holder and the outside of the wallet (the slot between the logo and where it says \"Pidengbao\" in the first picture), and it will be tight enough to not fall out, but I can easily access that card. I can even take a card in/out of that slot with it still in my back pocket.\n\nNow, I only have 2 regular house key-sized keys. I just stuck them halfway into one of the card slots of my previous wallet to store it (as a keychain for 2 small keys is just silly). No other reviews seemed to mention the 2 key holder slots in the picture. Well they work perfect for storing my two small keys that I have. I love this aspect specifically.\n\nThe only downside is of course the wallet itself is pretty thick.  I had to cut back on the cards I carry around, which isn't a big deal to me. I've got it at a size that will fit in my pocket easy enough and it is holding 6 cards, plus an ID, 2 keys, and of course some cash.\n\nIf you want just a regular wallet to hold a bunch of credit cards then look elsewhere. If you like to wear skinny jeans, look elswhere. But if you prefer to slide your cards out rather than pinch, or if you only like to carry only a few cards around, or if you need to store a key or two in your wallet, then give this a try. For the price, it's hard to beat.", "summary": "I can't believe I love this wallet so much.", "unixReviewTime": 1418515200}

It was made of real diamonds and my grandfather had given it to her. My own engagement ring was made from my my mother's engagement ring and exactly what I wanted, but that other ring was always in the back of my mind. My mom (though she loved the ring) had to let go of the real ring when we had an emergency vet bill in the late 1990s, and now I've found this one! There's a reason I'm telling you this.\n\nI am between an eight and a nine on my left ring finger (I have a set of ring \"sizers\" at home) so I originally ordered a nine. It was WAY too big. It kept falling off my finger. I COULD have worn it on a different finger, but I wanted something for my ring finger on days when my actual engagement ring is too tight. (I've gained some weight, so what?!)\n\nI liked this ring so much that I gave the size nine ring to my mom and ordered another in an eight for myself.  The nine fits her perfectly. The eight fits my ring finger perfectly though my ring finger measures 8.5.  I'm very happy.  It is still a little loose and I'm happy with that. It feels more like an 8.75.\n\nI felt both rings for loose stones and found that all were VERY secure on both rings. I worked in the yard with no gloves and mine became very dirty but was able to be cleaned easily.\n\nMy mom was THRILLED when she saw the ring I gave her! At first she thought it was Memaw's original ring! It looks so lovely and almost like it could be from any era. The stones aren't so large that they seem fakey, but they are a nice size. I'm think my engagement ring might be jealous!", "summary": "Beautiful! Runs about half a size big.", "unixReviewTime": 1469750400}

Very happy my hubby got this for me.", "summary": "Very pretty ring", "unixReviewTime": 1429315200}

I ordered this ring along with the Swarovski 2 CTW solitaire.  The rings are beautiful! The crystals catch the light and the rings sparkle. According to the jeweler's ring sizer, my ring finger is a  6 1/2.  However, these Swarovski rings are available in full sizes only so I decided on a size 6.  Surprisingly, the size 6 ring fits, and on some days the ring is loose!  Although I wear my Swarovski rings frequently, I don't wear them 24/7 because my concern is that they are not as durable as real diamonds. This may not be a valid concern.

Yes, it looks GREAT. The clarity and cut of swarovski crystals is fantastic, and Amazon did a great job and procuring a bracelet that was well built. All gems are centered properly, links are clean (a little rough in terms of fluidity in the chain though). There's no ugly glue, off-centering, different sized/clarity gems on this.\n\nTwo things:\n\n1) The bracelet arrives in two plastic bags inside of a manila envelope. So make sure you get a box to go with it. There's also a tag that says \"MADE IN CHINA\" along with the Swarovski certification tag. So make sure you remove that. Nothing says \"I love you.. kind of\" than a big \"MADE IN CHINA\" tag still on a piece of jewelry.\n\n2) THE CLASP! What people are saying is true. This is a hit and miss. If you're not doing much and you wear short sleeves or a dress, you should not have significant issues/risks of losing the bracelet. If you're wearing a sweater or jacket or something that is porous, this bracelet WILL catch the fabric and flip open one of the clasps within a few minutes of merely walking and swinging your arms. We knew the risk and tested the bracelet out when it first arrived. One clasp opened quickly. Merely putting your hand down on the table with the release lever facing down was enough to disengage the bracelet when both clasps were missing. Upon further inspection, the diamonds on top of the clasp itself seem weird, since they're not aligned with the rest of the bracelet. A watch style clasp with just a smooth locking mechanism would have been MUCH better in comparison.\n\nSo yes. This is a great piece. But it's not for every day use, which is why ultimately we decided to return it. If you know you won't wear it with sleeves, your risk of it catching are greatly reduced (warning: it can catch on the seams of your pants). It looks great, expensive, but the high risk of it falling and being lost forever are too great to justify keeping it.\n\nFYI, we bought the 7.25\" length and it was a good fit.", "summary": "I wanted to love it!

This also allows the knot piece to easily fall off it comes unknotted, and they're not as cute without the knot.

I'm happy we bought these headbands and am actually considering buying them in a different color/patterns.

I especially liked them for my babies early on when their hair was so short.  People always used to comment on how cute my little boys were, even though my girls were in dresses with their ears pierced.  Once I started putting headbands on them the boy comments were few and far between.  I own all different sorts of headbands and I have to say that I really like these.  They are a lightweight material that has a bit of stretch to it.  They remind me of a soft t-shirt.  They are about 3 in width across the back and tie in a knot in the front.  The colors are very vibrant and bold.  Size wise they are a bit bigger, I would say 6month-2T.  They fit the 7 month old in my picture very well.  They are easy to get on and off of the baby and she didn't seem to mind wearing them.  The knotted ties are a little longer than other similar style headbands so just watch how you position them.  Overall I am pleased with these headbands.  The solid colors will coordinate with many outfits and size wise you can use them for a good amount of time.\nI was sent this product free of charge in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Cute tie headbands!", "unixReviewTime": 1446076800}

Also, a few of the bands in the package didn't stretch at all, but a few did. The material is a soft cotton, but I would never buy these for a baby or let them wear them. I'll be tossing these.

You cant just run to the store and find these-we get lots of compliments!

After looking through the selection at Amazon, I narrowed it to a few rings.  This ring had the width, the look, and the heft (as the density of tungsten is nearly identical to that of gold).  If a product has only ten or twenty reviews, sometimes I am concerned that they may all be by employees of that company.  This ring has an exceptionally high rating and has almost 3700 reviews!\nI am thrilled with my purchase.  The comfort fit band is, well, very comfortable.  The size is spot on.  It is a beautiful ring and I am so pleased with my purchase.  Actually, my wife likes it so much, she has ordered one for herself for occasional wear.  The only thing with her relatively small finger is that she couldn't get the same width as me.

I would recommend them for anyone that does a lot of heavy work with their hands (my real wedding set sits in the safe because grew tired of paying for prong replacements and the jeweler asking \"what are you doing?!?!\" when they had to re-bend the bands to a circle shape) as they hold up well.", "summary": "Beautiful ring at great price", "unixReviewTime": 1516665600}

It is only a half shade or so darker in hue, but this is only noticeable in a side-by-side comparison. In reality, no one will know this isn't white gold. The ring looks and feels substantial and expensive. (NOTE: if you want the \"white gold\" look, be sure to buy WHITE tungsten, not regular tungsten. Regular tungsten is a darker gray.)\n\nCOMFORT: Looks and wears like a true comfort fit with smooth, rounded edges.\n\nDURABILITY: Two and a half months after our wedding, there is not a single scratch on this ring, even when viewed under magnification. It looks absolutely brand new. Despite the fact that tungsten is naturally more brittle than gold alloy and other metals used in jewelry-making, so far the ring has stood up to what I would consider an above average level of wear and tear without breaking.\n\nPRICE: Ridiculously affordable. Just under $18 as opposed to $300-400+ for good quality white gold (that scratches and needs polishing once a year)? A no-brainer. Plus, you get to skip the worries that accompany wearing an expensive piece of jewelry. If you ever lost this ring, replacing it would be a breeze. Eighteen bucks and two Prime shipping days later, voila! Brand new ring, negligible damage to your wallet.\n\nWOULD I BUY AGAIN? Without hesitation.

My sister tried it on and said her pinky finger started to fall asleep after wearing it for a few hours. She doesn't have that problem wearing the 6mm. Maybe that's why the 8mm is more of a men's size. The other difference between the 6mm and 8mm is the edge of the ring. The 6mm has a thicker edge than the 8mm. Both are comfort fit and domed. My guess is the 8mm dome would be uncomfortably thick to taper to the edge thickness I'm used to on the 6mm. Again, after 3 years, I love my 6mm white tungsten carbide.\n\nThe only other fyi is on the color.

I had wanted to try a tungsten ring for years, after I heard how strong and durable they were. This ring did not disappoint!! I am usually a silver or white gold kinda girl, and this matches closely, but it definitely has a little more of a chrome or slight blue color to it. I don't mind that at all. In fact, I've received compliments on it when people notice it's a little bit different. The comfort fit is also incredibly comfortable. You can tell that if you do anything too crazy with it, the ring could actually damage something else, not the other way around.

Now I wear the size 6 band shown here, stacked behind my engagement ring where it belongs, then the 5.5 on the outside to snug everything into place.

It was small, but since it's at the seams, it'll just get bigger if any pulling happens [which actually happened when I tugged on one of the shoulder straps to take the dress off]. I spoke with the company, and they offered me a 40% compensation if I could get it repaired by someone else. I paid about $7 for this, so I'm getting about $3 back, but getting it repaired would be a bit more if I want it done correctly by a tailor. I'm just going to stitch it up myself and hope nobody notices.\n\nSo if you do purchase this, just keep in mind that it's a hit or miss, especially when it's this cheap.

All of that being said, it is really beautiful with that unique color combination.  And it is somehow still pretty flattering despite my desire for a longer bodice.  I also had some issues with static in the skirt part, but I think that had more to do with the weather (and my lack of a de-static-ing spray, or even hairspray, which most women probably have).  Overall it was probably one of the best buys I've made through Allegra in terms of it fitting like the picture and looking like a much pricier dress than it actually was.

I'm having a boy so I went with the\"Nicole\" gown which is light blue with white polka dots. I loved the color, its a really pretty baby blue. For size, according to the size chart I'm a small, but upon reading some of the reviews I decided to get the medium, which fit perfect!!! I'm currently 36 weeks, 5'6, 145lb (116lb pre pregnancy), DD cup. The top still has room for growth which I like, and it easily comes down for breast feeding. I was concerned about the material, I didn't think it was all that soft, but once I washed it it got softer! It's really cute and covers all the right places. I'll be using for hospital and probably at home when visitors are here. My only recommendation for the company would be to use a softer material but other than that great gown.", "summary": "Going to be perfect for hospital", "unixReviewTime": 1503187200}

I ended up purchasing 5 more! I use them as day dresses and not nightgowns, most of the prints work out for this and they are thick enough cotton and long enough to go out in. I wore one just after giving birth to ride to the hospital in. It photographed well and I felt \"dressed\" and not like I was in some yoga wear or PJ.\n\nI will note that they are not support dresses- I wear a supportive bra underneath if Iam going out or feel the need to around the house, as the elastic under the breasts is not very tight/supportive. (To me this also is what makes it comfy so that's ok, but if you are looking for \"no-bra\" built-in support type dress, this is not it).\n\nThey've washed well in cold and warm water and in my dryer without shrinking.

The reviews were good so I sprung for a couple even though they were on the pricier side. They did fit according to the size chart. I wore them as nightgowns through the 8th month of pregnancy, then I packed them in the hospital bag and started wearing them around the clock after I had the baby.\n\nThe neck elastic is stretchy enough to pop a boob out quite easily, and it's manageable with only one hand and a fussy newborn since there are no fiddly clips. The elastic under the boobs means that it holds nursing pads in place (not perfectly but well enough), so I don't wake up in a puddle of milk. There's enough extra fabric in the abdomen that I was able to wear it for all except the last month of pregnancy and it was comfortable right after delivery, but not so much fabric that it will be too bulky going forward.

Nothing hangs out, but if I had a leak or engorgement, I'd want to be wearing a bra. I shamefully realized that I had worn this almost every night to bed for 2 weeks without washing it (gross prego moment!!). So I bought another! This time I got one of the prints that they carry a matching newborn gown in... (another gross prego moment!)", "summary": "After I wore this to bed for like 2 weeks without washing it, I decided to buy another!", "unixReviewTime": 1472947200}

The rest of the gown below the chest fits me alright even at almost 36 weeks.  I am about 5'7'', currently 185 lb, and 38D.  The chest is snug, but not overly constraining.  It's the sleeves that get me!  I keep pulling the sides of the gown down because the elastic around the under arm sits too high and irritates my already sensitive skin. I hope that with time, the elasticity relaxes a bit and becomes more comfortable.\n\nThe fabric isn't extremely soft, but got better after just one wash. I did not put the medium size in the dryer due to fear of it shrinking and no longer fitting me.\n\nI think these are slightly overpriced for the quality of the material and the amount of appealing patterns/colors available (more variety and darker colors would be nice!), but they are worth it if you find them on sale or are receiving them as gifts.", "summary": "Decent but overpriced", "unixReviewTime": 1464739200}

If you get a comfortable size, the cinched band in the middle won't sit right under your breasts, but instead will be an inch or so lower, which is what makes it less flattering (but also more comfortable because you don't have something squeezing you too tightly there).

I have smaller shoes since I wear a 7 1/2 in women's. I can fit 1 pair of my shorter ankle sneakers that are linner in one bag which is a plus because I can use the other bag for sandals for travel. If I want to pack a larger running shoe that has a wider sole, I have to use 1 bag for each shoe so it's probably best to have a few pairs of these bags for travel depending on what kinds of shoes you want to pack. Smaller, shorter heels of mine could fit into one bag, but I would suggest putting them in seperate bags so you don't get them scuffed up. I like the feel of the bags. It's a very soft material, so it won't scratch shoe material. The top and bottom of the bag is not as soft of a material. It feels kind of like nylon or something, but I don't think it would scuff or scratch. When it comes to my husband's shoes, he has some big feet. He wears a size 12. These can fit his dress shoes when really stretched but not his tennis shoes. They don't even fit through the opening. For us, this isn't too much of a problem because when we travel, he's usually wearing those. He prefers comfort when going places, so he would be packing his dress shoes in these bags if needed. Overall, these seem like quality bags that are well constructed. The draw string is easy to use with no resistance. My only complaint is I would like to see the opening a bit bigger and the bag a bit longer. If you like to pack more than 1 extra pair of shoes, I would suggest getting an extra sets of shoe bags for whatever your needs may be.\nI received this product free for my honest review.
