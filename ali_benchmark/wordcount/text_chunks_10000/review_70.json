These shoes are attractive and fit the bill being just gray and white lace ups.  When I first put these on my Kindergartner, my husband kept commenting on what cool shoes they were.  He thinks they look just like Vans.  My son liked wearing them and said they were comfortable.\nThe soles are a little stiff.  We usually buy shoes with super flexible soles for our kids, but these are stiffer, like a Converse.  However, my son never complained about it.  The shoes and laces have held up really well so far and seem to be well made.  They fit true to size and we had no problem getting them on even though my son's foot tends to be a little wider than average.\n\nI received a discount on these shoes in exchange for my honest review.", "summary": "Grommets tore out after a few months.", "unixReviewTime": 1453161600}

I was able to pick my dress up from the post office about three days after the expected delivery date, so it wasn't horrible.\nThe dress is stunning.

I was therefore somewhat expecting this to be a bad purchase, and was VERY pleasantly surprised by the quality.\nI have yet to find any sewing errors, tears, etc. I was also pleasantly surpassed to find the sleeves with a thin lining of the mesh material to protect the skin from the scratchy applique. I had tried on several dresses in nice boutiques that didn't have that and were really scratchy/itchy and uncomfortable. So that is a nice feature.\n\nI ordered a size 12, I'm 5'9\" and about 160lbs. I have an average build, pretty well proportioned, although a bit more on the pear shaped side but with broad shoulders. The dress fits me, but only just barely at the shoulders, bust, and arms. There is a little wiggle room in the waist though, and it is plenty long enough.\nI would recommend a petticoat unless you are very slender, and even then would probably be helpful.\nI am wearing a petticoat in my pictures.\n\nSo far I am incredibly happy with this dress and my purchase...

The armpit area was too tight for my arms and the neck line was paratically at my throat. Just FYI for shorter torso women. I'm going to make it work though because it's just for our anniversary pics. I'm going to alter it to be strapless. I can't stand the armpit area / neckline since it's made for somebody with a longer torso. It's what u get for the price which is why I'm not complaining lol but just giving this review so that others may take this into consideration before purchasing.\n\nThe hip area didn't bother me since it's just open in that area and it doesn't matter what size your hips are they'll basically fit.\n\nThe smell is pretty weird.

They are definitely okay for babies a bit older and toddlers. And actually, I can fit them on my own (small) head, although they are tight. However, I think they would comfortably fit a 5 or 6 year old with no issues.\n\nAnyway, they make a great accessory for pictures. I like that they are soft and don't have any hard edges.

After my last disappointing coat purchase, I wanted something very specific when I ordered this coat. The last coat I bought was not sized correctly, well according to American sizes, and the sleeves were very tight and the coat didn't button or zip, only had toggles, so it wasn't very wind/cold resistant. In light of that buyer's regret, this coat immediately made up for it!\n\nThe coat came in a large plastic bag, and was bagged separately inside the outer bag. Spreading out the coat, you immediately notice the thickness of the tweed on the outside. It feels very much like a wool coat would on the outside, but a bit softer to the touch. The coat is a very relaxed fit, with wider sleeves that taper a little to the thick, ribbed cuffs. They are very soft and can be easily folded back for easier movement and more warmth around the wrist. The front of the coat is fastened with both metal snaps and an inner zipper, with two tabs so the zipper can be opened from both ends without coming apart. There are two zippered pockets on the outside that can fit a cellphone, small to medium wallet, and keys, but not a large wristlet wallet.\n\nUp at the top, you have a high, ribbed, fabric collar that can be zipped to cover the mouth and throat. This is surrounded by the tweed collar that can be snapped in place over the fabric collar for more warmth. I was very happy to see that the hood (with a small drawstring) can be snapped off the rest of the coat and be separately washed. The coat comes down past the rear and lands just about my knees, and even with the zipper and snaps, is very comfortable to wear and sit in. One thing I noticed with some longer coats is that if the size is even slightly off, it is very uncomfortable to wear while driving or riding in a vehicle if you have the zipper/buttons/snaps all the way fastened. This coat, thankfully, doesn't have that problem at all.\n\n***Here's a piece of buyer's advice: The size chart they show on the Amazon page is ACCURATE! When they say that a 1X = 22/24W, they are correct. Do look at the size chart provided to see what size you need to order, and if you are a little unsure, maybe go one size up, but absolutely no more than that!\n\nI was intentionally looking for a larger sized coat that would be very comfortable and easy to wear while layering underneath it, and that's exactly what I got by ordering the 1X. I can easily wear a sweater or sweatshirt, layers of thinner shirts or tanks, jeans or dress pants underneath this coat and I'm guaranteed to be comfortable in this relaxed, slouchy winter coat.", "summary": "Size Chart Is Accurate And I'm Very Satisfied", "unixReviewTime": 1485734400}

It is roomy, with the huge inner pocket separated by a thin cloth divider, which helps with organization. Inside, it has a med sized zipper pouch on one side, 2 little pen/ lipstick/ earbud pouches on the other, and a key hook to keep you from digging around to find them. There is a roomy zipper pocket on the exterior of the purse, which is where I keep my phone for easy access, and the details on the outside are beautiful.\nThe strap is long, adjustable by buckle, and can easily be worn cross body. It smells fantastic, and the leather is thick, zippers are chunky but close smoothly. This is my new go to bag, it's a cavernous carry all and matches anything I wear.\n\nI gave 4 stars due to shedding issues from the strap, which is caused by the way it has been tanned. Any time I take it off I have to check my shoulder for leather dust. Don't get me wrong, it is supple, not dry; I think it is from the edges, hoping that will take care of itself after more wear.", "summary": "Wonderful", "unixReviewTime": 1510272000}

The arch support in these is really good and feels good on his foot. These are a harder insole but have a memory foam cushion layer on them too for comfort.\n\nI ordered a size 12 for his size 12 shoes and they fit in them perfectly. I didn't need to trim them at all. He really likes the layer of memory foam on these and says it takes a lot of pressure off his feet while he's on them all day at work. Normally we always bought just the cheap foam ones at the store which had to be cut down to fit the shoe or boot so it was nice that these didn't need that. Also the ones that are just foam from the store, doesn't last him and slide around in his shoes. These DoctorInsole ones have stayed in place and I anticipate them lasting him a long time because they truly are a real nice quality. I/we would definitely recommend these insoles to others. My husband loves them and so do his feet!\n**I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided.

Shortill", "reviewText": "BOTTOM LINE:\nAt about $130, this dress is good bargain, but it will likely require that you pay a seamstress to add a lining to the top.  Measure yourself and pay attention to the size chart before making your order.\n\nCONS:\n-- The top is see-through.  I will need to have a nude lining sewn through the top. Buyers of other dresses made by Now and Forever had commented that the dress top was see-through, so I half expected this.\n-- The bra cups sewn into the see-through lining are bright white, not nude, and are clearly visible like a pair of headlights.  HELLO!\n-- Pay close attention to the measuring chart and measure yourself accordingly.  Your size will likely be larger than your typical US size.\n--  I must hem the skirt because I am a petite and I ordered a regular.  I suggest that petites either order a custom size or alternatively be prepared to have the dress hemmed.\n--  To wear with a regular bra, I will need to have someone pin the top to the back of my bra.  Another woman might require a low back bra, depending on her shape and size and bosom.\n\nPROS:\n-- The seller Now and Forever contacted me by email after making the purchase through Amazon.  The representative was easy to understand and to deal with.\n-- The skirt of the dress has train and is meant to trail.  A tall woman would look very elegant the regular size I think.\n-- It fits beautifully through the bust and waist (if you pay attention to the measurements and follow the instructions!  Bra size is not \"bust\" size).\n-- The bead-work is good.  It is not too heavy. The beads did not look cheap or tacky.\n-- The skirt's fabric is very pretty and nice to the touch.\n-- The see-through fabric onto which the top's beading is sewn is not itchy.\n-- The look of this dress is very elegant. With alterations, it would be suitable for black tie functions. I will be wearing it as a \"reception dress\" at my wedding.", "summary": "Good value for the money, will need alternations to remedy see-through top, measure yourself carefully to ensure good fit", "unixReviewTime": 1447632000}

It looks just like the picture. When I received it, it had some wrinkles that I had to iron it. I usually wear size 4P or 4. This sweater fits me fine. The shoulders are a little wider than my real shoulders but because it's not loose, it doesn't add obvious width to my shoulders.\n\nIt's very warm to wear. Once I put it on, I haven't felt \"cold\" the whole day. The material is soft and very stretchable so that even if there is no extra room in arms and elbows, it moves with me that I don't feel unbearable tightness. It's very comfortable to wear. I like the length that covers my bottom. The lower part of the sweater is very forgiving being flared out with ample room underneath. I would just wear short-sleeve or sleeveless top inside as if I wear long sleeves, it would be not easy to pull up the sweater from the elbows to upper arms due to tightness. I would be careful in pulling it. Since the material is very stretchable, if you pull hard, you could see your own fingers through the material that if not careful, it's possible to pull out a hole with long sharp nails.\n\nThe collar can be worn rolled up or down. When it's cold, I can roll it up that has the effect of a scarf to keep me warm. When it's not that cold, I can wear it down that is very versatile.\n\nThis sweater although is very warm, it pilled after I wore it for two months. There are many small balls under my elbows.\n\nIt's perfect for my casual wear at work that looks sophisticated with its flattering shape, instead of just a regular rectangular shaped sweater without waist line.

He looks so classin and modern at the same time. It is so cool how all the little dials in the inside move. You can see through the watch and stare at the little gadgets move around.  I bought this watch for my boyfriend and he loves it. I thought it feels heavy on the wrist (at least the front part of the watch) but my boyfriend actually liked and said it feels confortable, so maybe it was my impression. If there was a simmilar in a smaller size I would wear it. It is stainless steel and it looks more expensive that it actually is.\nThe only thing that I didn't like was the packagte. The watch came in a plastic case and there were some fibers/dust on the inside (see photo). At first impression I thought the watch was dirty, but is just little fibers stuck on the protector plastic. After you take the plastic out it looks shiny!\nMy favorite part is that it doesnt need batteries so you don't need to worry about anything! Just wear it and go!\n\nI just boutht two (one for my boyfriend and one for my brother in law) as gifts and I`m very satisfied.

I suppose to make sure it didn't open during shipping. That I found to be quite tacky. The packaging in no way competes with the craftsmanship of this piece. It also comes with instructions. Also fairly tacky, on a cut off strip of paper. So if gifting I'd definitely upgrade the packaging. The recipient of this gift, loved being able to see the inner workings ,the weight and feel. And the old fashioned winding of the watch. It has a stainless steel backing and linked band with a secure closure. With enough room to fit most mens wrists. Great gift or purchase for anytime of the year. And a superb addition to any collection.

And to get a Skeleton that is also an Automatic and has luminous hands !!?? When you combine the three, the average price is normally $250 and up so this watch is a steal !\n\nThis is a large watch - the face is 42mm (similar in size to Invicta, Diesel, Tag Heuer). And it's wide also, nearly 1/2 inch thick. Watch does not come in a box, so if you plan to gift this, you'll need to go buy some stuff for presentation.\n\nFace and bezel have a lot of details.\nBezel:\n-- The color of the lettering and numbering is consistent. Font used is the same for both letters and numbers, Spacing between characters is good\n-- The 2 Pushers (located at 2 o'clock and 4 o'clock) are for looks only, they have no function\n-- The Crown (located at 3 o'clock) is used for setting the time (pull the Crown out) and for winding (when the Crown is in - roll / turn clockwise to wind). Based on what I see on the back of the case, via the glass window, it appears that this watch does incorporate a kinetic arm, which will wind the watch for you based on your arm movements. If you don't plan on wearing this watch everyday, I recommend you wind via the Crown.\n\nDial:\n-- Hour, Minute, and Second hands are luminous (they glow at night)\n-- Second hand ticks but it the movement is so subtle that it almost looks smooth, nearly Rolex smooth, almost as good as what Bulova uses for their Precisionist series\n-- The Hour Markers also appear luminous\n-- There's hash marks and numbers indicating the minutes / seconds (3 sets between each multiple of 5)\n-- Sub-dial in the center also has tick marks for each multiple of 5\n-- There's 4 arms spelling out (in very small font): Harwish (at 2 o'clock), Automatic (at 4 o'clock), Watch (at 8 o'clock), and Sport (at 10 o'clock)\n-- Raised platforms along the Dial Ring, which span every multiple of 5\n\nThe back features a clear window (I can't speak to the type of material, but it should be some type of crystal). The back can be removed - it's threaded versus snap.\n\nThe band is fairly lightweight and not the best quality. It features the standard 2-step clasp, to open: pull up on the locking bracket, then push the two spring loaded buttons on the side. The links can be removed but these don't use pins. Instead they use \"stretch band links,\" which are flat pieces of metal connecting two links together. These can be a pain in the butt to remove. Normally there's arrows indicating the direction of removal; however, this band doesn't have them. I plan to replace the band with something more heavy duty, which uses pins instead of the stretch band links (I prefer to do my own adjustments).\n\nOverall, I am impressed with the amount of detail and care put into this watch. I'm blown away that for what the watch is selling for, that it's an Automatic. Very, very happy with this even though I'm going to replace the band.\n\nI hope you found this review useful.\n\nI was able to purchase this item at a substantial discount in exchange for a thorough and honest review.

It's a very sturdy clip too, because my toddler was trying to play with it, and wasn't able to do any damage to it luckily. My husband is always asking for more ties, and tie clips, and this was definitely a two thumbs up purchase in his opinion. I would definitely buy this again!\nI have received this product at a free or discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.

I have a few bags my hubby out right refuses to carry, he himself has grabbed this one a few times when he need to take the laptop.\nSo there is two big pockets the back one is great for your laptop.  It had a little slot and also a Velcro attachment to keep your laptop in place.  There is padding in the front and back here to prevent your device from banging around.  In front of that is some extra room to store your chargers, mouse, ect\nThe front pocket is super organized and has a place for everything!  Pens, notepads, business cards and other small things.  Both pockets zipper so you don't nee to worry about anything falling out.\nThe front flap part has a really small area I found this to be perfect for my cell phone.  That way I can easily access it without having to dig around the whole bag.\nThe should strap is adjustable and has a pad up top to protect your shoulder from the weight.  Also their is a strap on the back, I've been using this around my waste in crowded areas.  That way I don't worry about my bag hitting someone or about someone trying to grab it off of me.\nI was sent a product to provide my honest feedback", "summary": "Nice size and very simple!  Great from him and her", "unixReviewTime": 1449705600}

There were a few loose threads hanging from the fringe, but nothing that compromises the design or quality.

I even saw people using similar scarfs as shirts and skirts. I wish the company would include instructions on how to do some of the different ties or make a product specific video and include a link with the purchase though. I do sometimes find it hard to wrap/tie the scarf where the tags aren't showing. It will just take some practice I guess.

The fabric is somewhat stretchy and sort of clingy, so make sure you wear smooth and lightly colored undergarments, otherwise they will show through.

The shirt is 100% cotton made in Peru.  They wash and wear well, and I expect to get years out if it (barring any stains or campfire ember mishaps).  It's super comfy, both the fit and the texture of the cotton fabric.  I use the dryer and shrinkage has not been a problem.\n\nI'm not an unbiased reviewer.  At last count my Life is Good collection has gotten past the 2 dozen mark, and they are more or less a uniform for me.  Over the years the LIG crusher shirts have gotten more form fitting.  That can be a good or a bad thing depending on preference.  The crusher tees are certainly not as form fitting at the LIG Newbury tees, but they're not as boxy as the crusher tees of old (we're talking 4 years ago old).  Over time they wash and wear REALLY well!  And get almost a patina quality.  Or perhaps I just tell myself that because I don't want to move on my tired old tees.

The color is a very dark blue that has to be I'm bright light to not look black. This very well made and doesn't seem like it should tear easily if nicked on something. The lining inside looks very good and is a lighter material, almost of the same color.\n\nI like the two buttons aren't the cheap buttons a lot of dress clothes use to minimize them from being noticed. This are nice thick buttons that really add style to a awesome looking jacket.\n\nThis isn't really something to keep you from being cold, but it will work on slightly cold days. With a long sleeves dress shirt underneath cold weather would be more than tolerable.\n\nI like the pickers this has a lot.  The pockets are all big and you have them inside and outside the jacket.

I felt assured it would arrive in time, and it did. Unfortunately, it arrived terribly wrinkled and I could never get it to smooth out enough to wear it. I threw it in the dryer, after spritzing it with a bit of water even, and the wrinkles STILL would not come out. I'd hoped the wrinkles would fall out over time but it is still like that - not as bad as it was, but still wrinkled... Very disappointing in that regard. I would think they would consider that in shipping. I didn't have time to contact the seller or ship it back, so I just let it go. I guess since it was shipped all scrunched up from China, and it is still wrinkled, it is likely permanent. It does fit a little weird too, the arms are really long and though the jacket does fit over all, its a little tight over clothes, so not all that comfortable - I would only wear it for the good looks... and, it has no pockets, so not very practical either. Not sure if I like the zipper thing at the bottom either. I know some reviewers love that option, but if you're like me and you don't like short stuff-and you know you'd never unzip it, it's just a little strange... looks good in the picture, but on, it is... well, just \"different.\" So, if you're looking for an inexpensive, cute jacket that does look like leather but is not at all practical but is very \"unique\" - and you don't mind a few wrinkles than be sure to order at least one size larger.", "summary": "Cute, but a little weird", "unixReviewTime": 1448064000}

I originally asked if I could get the dress in grey for my wedding, far before I ordered. I was assured that was no problem so I placed my order and a few weeks later I recieved a package and the dress had came but it was bright white. When I told them that I really didn't want a white dress, I was told it'd be more cost effective to sell the dress locally (used craigslist) and then send them money for a different dress in grey. Being in love with the style of the dress and not really being able to afford another dress on such short notice so I ordered another dress hoping it'd be the right color. So, the next dress was a off lilac purple, I made it work but it didn't go with my other colors so I had to get my husband to try and match his tux to me. So I wouldn't try and deviate from the colors they're used to making.

The real reason is that I have several belts, but my favorite fits just a fraction better than the others and it is ragged out and the others are still new and stiff. I had been searching for that size 40 belt that fit like a 40.5 I guess. Long story short, it worked great. I read a review about a guy sweating one out and it fell apart, but the one I have still looks new after two or three months. I decided to get one in brown to go with the black one and just snagged one on Amazon because it looked like the same exact kind. Beware! I got a Comfort Click belt and was dismayed that it was not as wide and the buckle design was completely different. And not nearly as good for me. The other belt got the good sounding name, but the Ratchet Click belt got the design right. The great things about it. 1 you don't have to bend the belt and search for a belt hole so it is quick and easy and doesn't crease your belt. 2 The strain is on the track system and not on the hole and the belt so you don't get a wallowed out hole or a buckle crease on the belt. 3 and the best thing is that it has one quarter inch increments so it fits like my favorite belt before lunch and after lunch and after working out too. The release system is SO easy and convenient (not like the Comfort Click which uses the buckle itself and the release) and you can tighten or loosen silently and quickly with no fuss. I love just grabbing the buckle with one hand and the tongue of the belt with the other and gently tugging it till it clicks to the perfect fit. My only caveats are that they don't offer a gold or brass buckle and I would really like the belt to be about an eighth or quarter inch wider. This belt delivers on the promise that I always thought might be there for those \"web belts\" that just wrap around the buckle. But those are just too flimsy and tend to loosen up because of the friction catch not being secure enough. I don't regret buying this belt and will be buying a dark brown next to go with this tan one.", "summary": "Finally a perfect fitting belt", "unixReviewTime": 1502150400}

Been in love with watches for a LONG time!  In my collection I have a Submariner an Omega Seamaster, some Citizen Eco drives (Nighthawk and Navihawk are my favs in that collection), Diesel watches, Kenneth Cole,  down to $65.00 Casio watches that had something neat or different about them so I bought them.  My more expensive watches were purchased pre-kids and 529's! LOL! I mention that to stress that cost and bang for my buck are more important today then ever.  I travel all over the country and I have seen a few friends as I travel with Invictas and really liked the look of the ones I have seen.  This being my third one I can say these are really cool watches.  I have had this one a day and have had two different people ask me what I had on?  Not saying that is why I like this watch but it can't \"hide\" on your wrist as this is a large watch and heavy!  Love the look, feel, fit and finish of this watch.  I was a little concerned with the weight of the watch not being comfortable on the wrist but this bracelet is really built well.  I think the weight of the watch was in mind when they made the bracelet because it feels great.  I am a larger person, 6'3\" and 255lbs.  With that said I have pretty small wrists, they measure 7.5\".  I have included some pics of the watch both on and off my wrist.  The bezel looks really cool, it is distressed just enough to give it a different look but still very up scale looking (IMO).  What I really liked about this watch was the interesting and different crown and pushers.  They look really neat and function pretty cool as well.  So far, the Invicta watches I have purchased have been amazing for the money!!!  I had to take 5 links out of the bracelet for a good fit.  due to the weight of the watch it needs to be a \"little\" tighter than some of my other watches. I used a vice and a few tack cloth or towels to wrap around the bracelet to tap the pins.  Easier for me that way.  It was very easy to do. If you want a large and industrial looking watch this is it!  Super happy with my purchase, I would recommend this watch and the brand to anyone.

The size I ordered is M, and looks like it is just about right. It is a little tighter than other shirts, but it is expected from the title of the product (Slim Fit). It arrived a lot quicker than expected. When I ordered, the estimated delivery was in about a month, but it arrived weeks earlier than the estimated date, Over all it is a nice shirt of good quality. I am happy with the order. I was offered a discount for an honest review.", "summary": "Nice shirt -- good for formal and casual", "unixReviewTime": 1453334400}

He came home and told me to keep the site in our favorites due to he would like to order more shirts from them and see what else they have to offer.

The shirt was bought for my husband and when he tried it on, it fit just as expected; definitely follow the size chart, because it's exactly right.  He's a medium, 15 1/2 size neck and a 34/35 sleeve, and he prefers slim fit shirts (as opposed to the traditional fit.)  This shirt fit similarly to a slim style, so something to keep in mind; if you prefer traditional fit, either go a size up or maybe look for a different shirt.  The neck/collar was perfect, although the sleeves were a tiny bit short; they fell just above his wrist bone, so about half and inch shorter than he'd prefer.  However, this is the perfect shirt for him to get away with rolling the sleeves, so that won't shortness matter; the shirt is professional, but is also casual.  It can certainly be dressed up with a tie, or it can be worn with jeans and a t-shirt; it's a good staple shirt to have, in my opinion.  In terms of craftsmanship, there were a few straggling threads on one side of the shirt, but I just clipped them; no big deal.  The shirt is very well made, and the fabric is soft.  I plan to order the green color for my husband, also.\nMy husband did refuse to pose for photos, so I'll update my review with a couple photos once I have the shirt ironed and hanging up.\nI did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "so I am unbelievably happy with the speed of this company's shipments", "unixReviewTime": 1452384000}

I love the flapper style dresses, so was excited to give this one a try!  I chose the gold color.  It's a really lovely medium gold that I think will probably be flattering on most all skin tones - even works well on my pasty white skin.  :)  The dress is entirely lined and non itchy (although still slightly sheer if you look at it closely) - I think it will work completely fine without a slip, which is good since the top is low cut and it has thin spaghetti straps!  I love the tiny little sequins on this piece - they only measure a scant 1/8\" in diameter, so smaller than most sequins.  The tassels are long (4\" and no big issues with tangling and knotting yet (that can always be the problem with tassels.)  They are sewn on nicely/swing a bit when you walk.  Very fun!\n\nI have this dress in the size small, so I would say the brand runs true to size.  I am 5'4\", 110 lbs, a B cup and have a 27\" waist.  I normally wear size 2-4 in US sizing.  This dress is made from a stretchy material so you have some leeway with the size, although the sewn on layers of fringe that run diagonal to the hem do NOT have stretch to them.  The top spaghetti straps are adjustable so the piece more easily works for a larger range of chest and shoulder sizes.  Conclusion?  At the under $30 price point, this is a great costume dress and I think you'll really enjoy it.", "summary": "Fantastic quality period piece - fun and flirty!", "unixReviewTime": 1471996800}

It does have the advertised 10 card pockets, and sub-dividers in the inside main pocket (not mentioned in the description). The texture of the outer wallet is almost rash, yet soft. The inside is coated differently than the outside, comprising of a more weaker canvas brown material. The wallet is decent to have been as the tag states handcrafted, and while I personally have my own wallet preferences, it combines nicely with the texture of the belt.\n\nSpeaking of, I like that the belt is reversible. Really saves you from going out to purchase another brown/ black belt. The texture of the belt itself is also a more coarser and stronger felt than the wallet. It feels like these were made out of the same leather, only more stronger. It doesn't have a slick and solid surface, it feels genuine and within a few uses, you're able to see \"wrinkle\" marks on it when used. The belt is a bit thinner than other belts, but still compliments nicely in the authentic look it has when worn with dress clothes.\n\nI am a size 34 waist and the belt fits me big, (it didn't have enough holes on it). So I punched some holes on it with no problem.\n\nOverall, a really nice and authentically looking set. The box and the ribbon on the top instantly makes this a perfect gift for a friend or loved one. If not, you can use it as storage or placement.\n\nSample provided at a reduced or free price in exchange for an honest evaluation.", "summary": "Wallet tinted brown/dull green.

It's packaged very nicely so it'd serve as a nice present. The belt has a strong leather smell (I like it, my husband found it a bit strong straight out of the box) and seems to be made well. The black side is a nice matte black, and the brown side is a nice medium brown - not too dark, and not too light. The reversible mechanism is easy to switch back and forth and it's impossible to know that it is a reversible belt. My husband loves these kinds of dual purpose things :).\n\nI also like the wallet! It also appears to be made of a nice leather and has a good amount of pockets for all of my husband's cards.\n\nI looked around for some time before purchasing this set and was not disappointed. My favorite part is really that it comes matching together and looks so presentable. I gave this to my husband as part of his birthday gift and it worked very well.

Black is often pretty well done, but browns can be a bit too much on the orange or red side and this one is the perfect balance.  The wallet is more of a hybrid brown/black color.  I have included a photo of the belt sitting atop the wallet to give perspective to this particular color shade.\n\nThe stitching, on both the wallet and belt, appears to be quality work.  Additionally, the finish for both feels natural  not too stiff, not too rubbery.\n\nThe layout of the wallet is very nice, with a compartmentalized cash bill area.\n\nThe belt measurement was spot-on.\n\nThere are a few minor points that I would think the manufacturer could address easily:\n- The mechanism to rotate the belt buckle is a little stiff.  I am not sure if this is something that will become more loose with use, or will wear with time.\n- The wallets leather feels a little less luxurious than the belt.\n- The gift box was coming apart in multiple corners, detracting from the look and feel of its contents.\n\nI was given the opportunity to purchase this gift set at a discounted price, in exchange for my unbiased review.

Really I would say this jacket is costume quality. The material just feels very rough. Along with the cheap material, the top button on my blazer was sewn on upside down. Now you are probably wondering why I gave the jacket three stars even though the material is poor and buttons were sewn on upside down. Well I will say that the jacket's design is one of a kind, and even though the material may be cheap the overall jacket was stitched well and unlike other Asian blazers I have purchased, it did not have any loose strings or material hanging anywhere. I have received blazers from other sellers that have been far worse than this one. I originally needed the blazer for a role in a short film. Once again I will say that I like the look of the jacket just not the material it is made of.  Overall all I'm neither happy nor sad about the purchase just indifferent. The jacket did fit me perfectly. If you are considering purchasing this blazer make sure you order two sizes up. I will probably not buy another one of these blazers or encourage a friend either, unless the price comes down.

I am 5ft-nothing. I hate wearing tight clothes so I usually go with a junior medium and then wash them in hot to make them shrink. I didn't know if this dress was going to be a junior size or not, but I read other reviews that said it ran large, so I went with small, and I'm really glad I did! The dress runs big. It runs like a size small in Apt. 9, Max Studio, White House Black Market brands (aka it's big!). It is NOT Wet Seal or Hollister small. In those brands, it would be a large or x-large. I washed it in hot water and each time it shrinks a little. Because of the material (knit, soft, stretchy), I think it'll continue to shrink a little every time I put it in the wash on hot (which I'm hoping it will). It's still not tight around the stomach or waist, though. I like the length, it's very classy because it hits right below the knees for me. I wear it with the sleeves pushed up because it looks much better overall as a 3/4 sleeve than a long sleeve because of the odd, kind of boxy shape(non-shape) of this dress.\nThe material is on the thinner side, but I like it! I wore it to work and the friction/swinging of my badge on the dress caused that one particular part on the dress to get that fuzzy, pilled look. But I have a fabric lint/pile remover so I just went over it with that once I got home and it came out like new. The v-neck is not a deep as shown and can be worn at work without all that cleavage.

YES, the fabric for the skirt and the cape are going to be cheap, but come on, look at the price! The top is a nice fleece and the symbol is a stitching that was a little messed up on mine but nothing that a few snips from the scissors couldn't fix. The skirt and top are attached, the cape is attached by velcro so it would be removed, and the belt is separate. I am 5'6\" and around 150 lbs and I got a Medium. Sadly, the costume is a little loose for my taste, but I was mainly worried about it being short, but it's not! The belt is really really big, I don't know why, so I think I might cut it and use safety pins to hold it together because there is no way to tighten it because it is also velcro attach in the back.

Wear tights or boyshorts underneath and call it a day.\n\nIt's cheap fabric - but I knew that since I bought at a super cheap price. Want quality? Pay hundreds of dollars.\n\nDress comes with detachable train, veil, garter, gloves and choker.\n\nDress top (from boob area to waist) has some type of cheap lace (that I happen to like). Dress bottom has that satin look to it. Under the flair part, it has a layer of tulle attached, which does the same thing a single layer petticoat would do.  I actually love this because it gives the dress a lil fluff.  There's a zipper on the back of the dress. Dress has elastic spaghetti straps - that you can cut off if you're into the strapless thing.\n\nCOLOR: dress is white. And it looks dirty. It's meant to look dirty since it's a CORPSE. I'm not sure if the bride is a burnt victim and the \"stains\" are meant to be smoke stains... Or if she was buried with her wedding dress and now she's all dirty.  Whatever. The \"stains\" are blackish/grayish color and they are on the front and back of the dress. Stains can also be seen on the accessories (veil, train and the other stuff).\n\nSIZING: I actually took a chance here. They had what they call \"Free Size\" stating the measurements to be: Bust: \"88cm/34.6\" Waist: 76cm/29.9\". This dress fit me like it was made for me. For your reference MY measurements are as follow: Bust 36C (or 34D), Waist: 28, the hips measurements do not matter since the dress is only tight on the breast/torso area.  THE DRESS DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF STRETCH so if you have bigger breasts/waist than me, don't buy this as you will not fit in it.\n\nAll in all, the crappy picture they have here of the costume, is pretty much what you get. No lies there.\n\nTotally worth the twenty something bucks I paid for it. I'm definitely a happy camper.\n\nHappy Halloween y'all!", "summary": "DEAD BRIDE WALKING", "unixReviewTime": 1477353600}

I was confused about the use of the words \"slim fit pleated expansion.\" (maybe all the skirts under the heading Expansion Skirt aren't actually that).  I was thinking maybe the skirt had a partial expandable or elastic waist, which could be somewhat forgiving, but not so.

I ordered a Medium skirt last year (I typically fit into a 6 in women's sizes) but I have what I would call a unique hip/waist curvature that can make high waist skirts and pants awkward looking. Decided to try this skirt anyway because everyone looked so cute in their \"Review\" photos and I thought it would be perfect for an upcoming social event! My initial fit was not great. The skirt hugged my waist a bit too tight and created slight stomach rolls/lumps over the top of the skirt. Not so cute. I contemplated returning it, but fortunately for me, my new job had me running around so much that I lost a few inches in my waist right before the event. I slipped into the skirt the day of the party, and it fit great and got plenty of attention. My suggestion: Check your measurements with the sizing chart.

So my advise is be mindful of your underwear color choices (strictly black undies only in my case).

I ordered the matte black frame with the black, bronze, green HT, and clear lenses. I was looking for a sunglasses SYSTEM for work that would allow me to interchange lenses depending on the weather conditions. I had Laser Eye Surgery back in 2001 and i've always been a little sensitive to the light....I've been using sunglasses almost daily since. I really like the Oakley Radar shield style but I'm not a fan of the optics.\n\nPlease note. I use these sunglasses DAILY and they get tossed around quite a bit. I swap the lenses out sometimes twice in one shift and I use a micro fibre cloth for cleaning. The case that Maui Jims sends is FANTASTIC. I can house the sunglasses (with a Lens) and 3 additional lenses in the same case....4 lenses in total in 1 case!!!! I keep these stuffed in my duty bag and after vigorous use the case still looks good.\n\nThere are some negatives to these sunglasses. I found that after a year the matte finish started to wear off on the frames. I also noted that the middle button on the bridge has stopped working. It would depress but was not clicking into the lenses. The beauty of these lenses is that the side clicks can support the lens without the middle...but the middle button definitely has a design flaw. I also found that there are some distress points and cracking on the bridge of the lenses (especially the bronze)....this I assume is due to frame flexing during daily wear.\n\nIf this was any other brand I'd probably one star these and move on. But I can't say enough about the optics of Maui Jim lenses....for that reason alone I keep using these for work despite the flaws. The bronze lenses on most days are a treat....I love these lenses the most. During our blazing summers I'm usually rocking the black lenses. For our overcast rainy days (we have lots in Vancouver) I like to use the Maui HT Green lenses (despite my colleague commenting on how the green makes him feel depressed). I opted against getting the Rose lenses because I felt that I was doubling up with the Maui HT Green.....My colleague uses the Maui Rose and finds those optics pleasing.\n\nI did contact Maui Jim a few years back complaining about the bridge button and other issues. They told me to send them in for an evaluation. Life got in the way and I missed the 2 year window for warranty coverage.....my bad....not theirs. I've used Maui Jim warranty coverage in the past for nose pieces etc on other sunglasses and a colleague sent his Switchbacks in and had them fixed without any issues.\n\nI am waiting for Maui Jim to release another style of interchangeable lenses.....until then I will continue to use these until they fall apart....which I predict will happen within 2 years.", "summary": "I LIKE THEM.......BUT THEY'RE NOT PERFECT", "unixReviewTime": 1476576000}

The chest and abdominal straps do not offer a sleeve, which results in the abdmonial strap of having extra strap hanging as a result of tightening as there is not a way to tuck it away. Though I did learn that that abdominal strap, you don't want to tighten too much, and you want to keep it flexible, for the comfort of the dog. When I tightened too much, my dog could not comfortably sit. Having it looser did not allow for the vest to slide off or be easily moved.\n\nMy dog is 85 lbs, and I ordered the largest size they offered. My issue was that I didn't want to order a vest that was too small, but after trying it on, I realized that a size smaller wouldn't have hurt. So measure your dog twice before deciding which size to buy.\n\nMy dog doesn't seem to mind it. With it on, he is able to sit, walk, run, lay down, and can't shake it off even when he tries.\n\nThe velcro spans the entire top, and the loops are on both sides.\n\nNothing is included except for one velcro patch that I think is intended to make your dog look cool.\n\nAlthough a free sample was provided in exchange for an honest review, my opinion does not change based on whether or not I paid for an item. In this case, I felt the sizing was a tad off as I ordered too big of a size, but other than that, I don't really find anything wrong with it. I'm not thrilled about the abdominal strap, and think it both takes some getting used to and adjusting, but there was no instructions included, so you're kind of on your own.", "summary": "Measure twice, cut once", "unixReviewTime": 1469232000}

I am 39 in waist ,Tag says US medium Tag L. I need a medium but don't see where it is offered. Not happy about that.  Because it is to large it's not supporting my balls in properly in front like I feel it should because the g string for this size labeling on tag Size US medium Tag L  is to loose for my frame. I know g string doesn't need to be to tight but this size isn't really working. Having to pull g string up higher around my waist to get g string in my crack to pull front panty tight enough to pull my ball sack in and support them to. Need medium  Happy with the material and Love the product just the way it is. Just would like to see it in medium medium.\n\nAfter trying one out I've discovered that the crack g string will actually roll up around the waist g string if you set the front panty around  your ball sack and penis first and then pull the slack out of crack g string and then raising the waist g string up slightly and then releasing. This seems to have a reverse effect on the elastic g strings by rolling up a little of the crack g string automatically around waist g string and keeping the slack that I was experiencing before and now my ball sack fits perfectly in the front panty.  The front panty is a perfect design to hold the ball sack and penis very comfortably in place. Feels great to. Very happy with the front panty after I discovered that you should first  pull dpwn and back first on crack g string just enough to set ball sack and penis in front panty and then slightly pull up on waist g string and this sets everything nice and comfortably so that it will adjust to your liking. Absolutely love the colors and spandex material. I can now appreciate a little better the one size for this product. It's like it's adjustable. Everything I've described of course would work for men with waist size 39 inch or smaller in my opinion for this tag size US medium/ L.  Would however still like to see it in a medium medium.  Great product Kingsky. Please consider making a medium medium and I'll buy that size to.  I've decided not to return this size.", "summary": "To Large need it in medium", "unixReviewTime": 1460764800}

In fact, there are no tags whatsoever on this shirt identifying where it was made and what it is made out of nor does it say the size.\n5) They are located in China and it takes a long time for the item to arrive.\n\nHere are the positives: seller contacted me in a timely manner when I had a question; the item arrived on time.", "summary": "A cheap knock off product", "unixReviewTime": 1481673600}

When I got home and took it off, there was dog hair, hay AND human hair all inside the lining...everywhere. It was ridiculous. I took it to the tailor (since I couldn't return it at this point) to have the lining replaced and they wouldn't even accept it even after I gave it a good shaking because it had so much hair in it. It took me about an hour with a lint brush because the hairs had literally woven themselves into the fabric lining the jacket.

It seems well constructed and it's warm.\n\nThe Cons: I thought Woolrich products were made in the USA but this Jacket says, Made In China.

A belt loop was broken, there were dark dirt spots all over it, the buttonhole closure was stitched completely closed and never opened.
