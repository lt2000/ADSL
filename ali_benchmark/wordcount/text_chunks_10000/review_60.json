If you do then you are in the right place and if you don't you soon will. I have been wanting a new cell phone for probably around 5 weeks because of my job as a reviewer I come across things that require the newest android & blue tooth etc and as you can see by my video the camera is really lame as well so it's time for a new phone and I thought it sure would be nice to get a cell phone to review and everyday the thought goes through my mind, I even started a pitch letter to send to Samsung but, haven't sent it or pitched to any other sellers. Then 3 days ago when I finally got around to opening this package to see this cute little guy in there. I'm checking it out looking at the quality thinking wow this is really a nice score because I got a coupon for it at 100% savings. Anyway, just so happens I had this silver chain that was perfect for it..so I put it on and have kept it on day and night not really thinking anything about it, just cute..I wasn't thinking Talisman but, I'm pretty sure this one is a for real deal. because, after wanting a new cell phone so bad for more than a month, I received a request yesterday asking me if I would like to review an unlocked cell phone. Can you believe that? The other weird thing is the whole time I've been wearing it I have this feeling I am going to get rich. I never think like that and wearing it is an unconscious thing. I mean I wasn't putting any spiritual energy into it..not like with crystals or prayer. So now what? lol I am aware and taking notice I also dislike taking it off..is it coincidence? As far as the craftsmanship on this piece it's awesome and well worth the price tag they have on it. It's presented nicely in it's little box. I showed a picture of him to a couple of my Chinese friends and one said it was a Japanese fortune cat and then my other friend she said no it's Chinese and the symbol \" is lucky, in the end neither one could remember the position of the paws saying one paw up was maybe Japan and two paws up like this guy is Chinese so I don't know gonna be a good question for me to ask. Either way you're gonna make yourself or someone else very happy with this little guy :) Peace!, ~Kiki", "summary": "DO YOU BELIEVE IN MAGIC?", "unixReviewTime": 1464825600}

It is made of genuine 925 sterling silver, this will not turn you green.  The cat is adorable, and the detail of this is stunning.  Red Swarovski crystals dot the bale which hangs on the bracelet, adding a touch of bling and sparkle without being overdone.  Similarly, 2 clear Swarovski crystals dot underneath the cats paw.  It is cute, but elegant, and is appropriate for jewelry wearers of all ages. The attention to detail is great, even the base on which the cat can stand up is detailed with ornate carvings. Red enamel adds to the detail.\n\nIt is well made and heavy duty, this is not cheap costume stuff.  I would say the quality here is on par with, if not better than the big brand name bracelet and charm companies.  I have looked for similar designed lucky cat charms from the other companies, and I feel this one is the most aesthetically pleasing with so much detail. It is a heavy weight, and there is a lot of silver here, but it is not so heavy that it will weigh your bracelet down.  It is also multi-functional. This charm is compatible with both Pandora style and Trollbeads style bracelets, and would fit other European style bracelets.  It is also able to be worn as a pendant on a necklace.  I even was able to wear it on a hoop earring, how cute would a pair of them be? This charm is great and I cant rave about it enough. It always makes me smile and I really enjoy wearing it, and I think you will too.\n\nI received this item for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "High quality and super detailed, stunning....", "unixReviewTime": 1462665600}

So for Christmas I decided to buy her this Bettie Page wallet. She is also a big fan of Bettie Page so this was 2 birds with 1 stone without a doubt. Excited and anxious for this to arrive, I waited by the front door so I could personally receive the delivery. After opening the packaging I looked at the wallet and had a huge smile on my face just knowing my girlfriends reaction is going to be priceless. Yet after giving it a \"once around\" I had noticed that there was some crooked and off-stitching and instantly my stomach felt like it was in my throat. After dreading giving my girlfriend the wallet, she was beyond stoked with it. She didn't even notice the blemish at first and when she did it didn't phase her one bit until it cane time to closing. She hates returning items, especially gifts, and when I told her I wanted to send that back she had gotten upset and showed me she could jerry-rigg it close to make it work. After seeing her get frustrated with it yet still not complaing, I took it upon myself to contact Sourpuss and see what I should do. After getting ahold of them, I was helped by a lady by the name of Libby and let me tell you she gained a lifelong customer with the way she helped me. She was very understanding and very easy to communicate with. Libby had expressed her extreme apology and sorry for the inconvenience. She had given me the option of having me send her some photos of the off set fabric stitched and assessed what she needed to help me and reimburse me with a brand new wallet with no hassle what so ever. Libby was amazing to deal with and again I will never have a second though, nor should you, about buying any Sourpuss product because I know that I am getting a quality item and if not I will be getting beyond amazing customer service. So I Dont see any reason for anyone to be unhappy in the end with the outstanding service and product. THANK YOU AGAIN LIBBY.", "summary": "Dont You Worry!!", "unixReviewTime": 1420761600}

The fabric is thin, the dangling fringe looks a little silly, and the flower pattern is painted shimmery silver.

I had to hoped to wear these scarves as mantillas to veiled mass as a part of my summer aesthetic - somber 50s Catholic housewife who is seriously tempted to strike up an affair with the pool boy or her best girlfriend to alleviate the tedium of her endless shopping/homemaking/shopping route.\nApart from the silver, the scarves just don't look very flattering on. The fabric hangs a bit weirdly around my face and the two pointed ends are way too long. I'll end up wearing them anyway because this is aesthetic on a budget and at $4 they are the only affordable option, but I wish they had left the silver fabric paint on a homemade homecoming t-shirt where it belongs.", "summary": "I had to hoped to wear these scarves as mantillas to veiled mass as a part of my summer aesthetic - somber 50s Catholic housewif", "unixReviewTime": 1465257600}

They come from China via China Post so it takes about a month to receive it. Normally I wear a Men's XXL size shirt from Ralph Lauren or Nautica. There is a Warning in the listing for these shirts that they run small by about one size. I found that in reality they run about 4 sizes too small. If you Order a XXXL you will get a Medium in USA size. That is before it is washed as it will shrink more no matter what you do or how you wash it. In other words if you wear a size Large or above in USA sizes these shirts will NOT fit you. If you are a small or a medium USA size order the XXXL for these shirts.  I ordered the largest size they had the XXXL and it was far too small. I am a six foot 2 inch man normal weight for my height and this XXXL shirt would not make it down to my belt line.

I went with the white/silver set as they were the same exact colors I had originally worn back in 2009 for my sisters wedding and they were gorgeous. I figured I would go with that as they would match anything and everything I wore.\n\nWhen it came time to put them in my ears, I got a little confused. I originally had the bigger pearl on the part of my ear that shows and the smaller pearl behind it. With how heavy the bigger pearl felt, I knew something had to be wrong. So I switched them around. After doing so, it didn't feel so weighed down anymore. I made sure to come back to Amazon and see if I had them in correctly, which I did. Beings it was my first time ever wearing earrings like this, that was to be expected. Haha.\n\nAt first I wasn't too crazy with how they looked in my ears. Normally I just wear studs and that is that. I wasn't too sure about the whole double look that these kind of earrings give off. After wearing them for a bit, I finally saw how unique they are.\n\nWould I normally wear earrings like this? No, I wouldn't. If I hadn't received these to review, I'd probably just go get a regular pair of pearl earrings and call it a day. Because I had the opportunity to review these Stylish Double Sided Tribal Pearl Earrings I was able to see for myself the beauty in them. They aren't your normal pearl earrings and I can't seem to stress that enough. I would like to mention that if you aren't used to wearing heavy earrings in your ears, these will feel heavy until your ears get used to them.\n\nThese earrings are beautifully made and if I ever need a gift idea or another pair, I now know where to go to purchase them in the future.\n\n*I received this product for review purposes.

I am 100% satisfied and feel much better about sending her to school with Laceez as opposed to shoes she cannot tie. Laceez has certainly made our morning routine faster & easier and I know its made her teachers job easier too!\nAs far as The sizing goes, that can be a little tricky. The pair we got was a little long for her style of Nike tennis shoes. So I just had to re-run the Laceez through the top two holes again. That however was not a big deal at all.

Even when I was younger I had a fascination with necklaces, bracelets and earrings. I think it is a part of every woman. It helps us to sparkle and shine. So I loved the sparkle to this necklace here and I couldn't believe that not only does it come with a necklace, but it also includes a nifty little piece of hardware. Or should I say, a fashion accessory for your hardware?\n\nThe necklace itself is very pretty. The chain is not as nice as I would like, you can just tell the quality isn't the greatest, but for the price it is a sweet gift. Perfect for teenagers or young adults and I think the fashion accessory it comes with would be a great fit for teenagers as well. If you own an iPod or iPad, you know how much dust gets in the headphone jack. Even with a case it still gets dirty. This set here comes with a plug to keep dirt and dust out! And it is a diamond charm! How cute is that? Needless to say, I enjoy the necklace and while I wouldn't mind keeping the diamond charm, it has disappeared into the iPod of my sister. Sweet set!\n\n*Disclosure* I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

The crystal gem catches the light and sparkles beautifully. I like the teardrop design and the cz stones in the setting, it sits very pretty in the 18in chain. The clasp is a traditional hook style and seems of average quality. I do like that it slides off without catching so I can switch the pendant easily if I want to use a shorter chain. I think the color is perfect for a preteen or teenage girl.\n\nThe cell phone dust protector bling is cute! It is not the same color of the necklace but that's ok. I actually received a green gem (my necklace is pink) and it fits perfectly in the aux port on my LG G4. It's a cute accessory. I'm thinking this will make an excellent stocking stuffer.

It was one that made noise and had lights, but it didn't impress me. Now here I am years later and I found something that looks as identical to the Stormtrooper's standard as you can get. I really love the design, it fits in your hand, it's really compact and it's about as close to the blaster seen in the film as you can get unless you construct a custom version of it.

When I checked with them to be sure, they told me to just return the package to sender and they would send me the right lenses for no extra charge.  They came as promised, and they fit perfectly.  It took a little more effort than I thought it would - both to get the old lenses out and to put the new ones in (I used the trick of heating the glasses in HOT tap water to expand the frames to get them out, still afraid I might break one of the original glass lenses and cut my hands, but no problems).  I'll just have to see how these polycarbonate lenses hold up - I really liked the old glass lenses until they got scratched.  And I'm not sure I ever had polarized sunglasses before.  Others are right - they really make smart phone displays dark, and one iPhone looks green in the vertical position and magenta in the horizontal, so if you don't care for that kind of funkiness, you might stick with the non-polarized version.  But I have to admit, they sure cut down on light reflecting off the pavement, and for the price, you could get both.  It's GREAT to have new scratch-free lenses in my old vintage American-made Ray-Bans, and at a FRACTION of the cost of the new ($200) Italian (polarized) version.  And these being American made lenses, it's that much better.  I've since ordered replacements for my Oakley Whiskers.  I know those will be easier to install since the frames screw apart.  DON'T THROW YOUR OLD SUNGLASSES AWAY WHEN THEY GET SCRATCHED AND DON'T HESITATE TO REPLACE THE LENSES.

I went to give it to him and this was nearly impossible to adjust. I am pretty buff for a lady too. i ended up having to have my boyfriend struggle to adjust it. now that it is adjusted it fits with the paws touching.\n\nOther than that it is really cute and i think i am going to buy one fore the entire family. the quality is great and has great detail. so far my son has been wearing about 2 weeks and don't see a sign of any wear.\n\nI was able to receive this at a half off discount and am really glad i did.

I received the \"September\" version of this piece, which includes a sapphire bead that dangles from the center setting. It really looks and feels great in person.\n\nI like the bracelet that we received and would recommend this to anyone looking for unique, interesting and fun jewelry.  The 10mm silver beads sit around somewhat elastic monofilament that has some give to it, making it easy to slide this bracelet on & off over my wrist.\n\nWhen laid flat on the table, the unstretched bracelet measures about 4 inches across (or 8 inches in total length) and it was an easy stretch to about 4.5 inches (9 inches total length). As mentioned, this thing weighs in at about 1.8 ounces per our postal scale, so it does feel and look substantial.\n\nI lightly buffed the silver with a soft microfiber cloth, and it sparkles nicely under the light. The silver (described as silver plated base) and sapphire colors look outstanding together. There was no mention of a warranty that I found, so if an unexpected issue occurs within a reasonable period of time I would return to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. I received this beautiful bracelet gratis from the seller and wore it to see how it looks and feels. My statements here reflect that testing and his sentiment.\n\nIf you are looking for a beautiful, substantial bracelet of this quality, construction, price, size and style, then I would recommend giving this piece from Cat Eye Jewels a try based on my experience with it.\n\nRecommended.\n\nGo for it.", "summary": "Tibetan Silver & Sapphire colored beads - About 8 inches long - One size fits all - Beautiful - Recommended", "unixReviewTime": 1433721600}

It is listed as a hat for those who have hair loss, but she does not have that issue.  The thing is, this hat is totally stying!  I love the way it fits her, and it is wonderful for many reasons.  The grosgrain ribbon can be utilized to tuck in accessories to match an outfit, a flower, a feather, a pin, and so on.  Since she is a professional entertainer as well as an artist, she can use this hat to dress up an outfit that is used on stage.  It is extremely well made.  I think that if it were listed differently as something  that is universal it would be more commonly worn, since it is adorable.  No lie.

The color is not a bright burgundy, but a darker, dusty, muddled burgundy, which looks really awkward with the black trim in my opinion (very low contrast). On the model, the hat also looks like it has a bit of structure. On me it looked frumpy. It is a lightweight unstructured knit. It might be comfortable to some, but is much less fashionable in person. I thought it made me look too much like an ill patient.\n\nThe return process was also not as smooth as others I have had on Amazon. We ended up having to pay shipping to return, even though the product was represented differently than the reality.\n\nOn a positive note: the packaging was beautiful, and done with much care.

She hates hats and was avoiding shopping for one even though her hair was falling out due to the chemo treatment. She loves this one I picked out for her. I was a little confused by the size chart because there didn't appear any way to select a size. The hat has no size marking in it so it appears to be one size fits all. It is slightly large for my wife's head but fits okay anyway. From the photos it appeared to be made from velour but is actually constructed of two layers of cotton knit similar to tee shirt material. The corduroy-like trim around the edge really makes the hat stand out.  My wife is an expert seamstress and she commented on how well made it is. I was impressed with the presentation; it was carefully wrapped in issue paper on a cardboard backing with a pretty refrigerator magnet on top.\n\nUpdate: It's been eight months since I ordered this for my wife. I also purchased the burgundy one. The burgundy color is much muted compared to the photo in the ad and looks much better because of.

It would even work for someone with a full head of hair and needing some head coverage.\n\nI bought the beige hat and love the color and design of the hat. The hat has a solid under material of tan, and the top material has a design lines that somewhat resemble zebra stripes mixed with a few short stripe designs here and there, of both solid and sheer material that shows through to the underside material. Then there are little sequins all around that shimmer different colors like blue, green, orange, etc.\n\nThe size inside on the tag says it is 57 cm, it fits both my daughter great. We are able to pull it down over our ears and cover everything, or let it sit higher and look more like a newsies hat.\n\nLoosing hair can be especially hard for women and young girls, we put so much emphasis on our looks and a lot of that is on our hair. I would recommend this hat to anyone especially those who want to feel their best, as the rest of us know how beautiful they are, sometimes it helps to feel it themselves.\n\nI did receive this in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

Hem longer than expected - but again, no big deal.\n\nMaterial wasn't as expected. Polyester and kind of rough, but not uncomfortable. Hoping it will be breathable on hot days.\n\nSkirt is very cute. The reason for the 4 star reviews is because it is see through. Definitely plan to wear a slip under this. I was bummed about this initially, but then I realized I always wear bike shorts under skirts like this anyway, so I suppose a slip isn't a big deal.\n\nEven with a slip, you can still see the curve of my legs and booty if you're staring.

Patterned? No problem. Short? No problem. But it seemed like everywhere I looked - there were no cheap options for me.\n\nI decided to take the plunge and try shopping online for skirts about a year ago - which was a big deal for me, because I am very pear shaped. It's hard to shop online because I can never tell if it'll be flattering due to my hip:waist ratio.\n\nWell I'm glad I did. These skirts are amazing. They fit well, with just enough flexibility to be comfortable, while also having enough elasticity that they have no trouble staying in place. They are made from quality material. The colors are true to the picture. They are very flattering, on most body types. My girlfriend is very square shaped, with a tummy - looks great! I have ridiculously wide hips, with little to no tummy - also very flattering!\n\nThey are long enough that I am able to hike them up to my boobs if I'm feeling a little cheeky (though keep in mind I am 5'3), yet also offer some sense of decency and covers down to my knees if worn at my waistline.\n\nSo why the four stars?\n\nI've bought four of these skirts over the past year. Each one has been different. I have two black skirts (one for me, the other for my girlfriend) and the material feels different (though maybe that can be due to the fact that they had been bought about a year apart?). I also have a red one, which is a LOT thinner than the black version, and lays slightly less \"fruffy\" (for lack of a better word) around my hips (no complaints here, though). The most recent one I bought, the white, was also a LOT more see-through than the others. (Looks like I'll be investing in more white undies...) Which is, I suppose, what I should expect from the picture. But no less disappointing seeing as I absolutely love these skirts.\n\nAll in all these skirts are a great investment, and I definitely plan on buying all color variations with time. Just be aware that there might be some difference in make between one skirt to the next.\n\nOr who knows, maybe I just got a weird batch.", "summary": "Great quality, very flattering!", "unixReviewTime": 1469923200}

I realize the large style might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I really like these. I received the i-Design Purple Metal Sunglasses at no cost to review and I love that they are so light! They don't dig into my nose or hurt my ears. I chose the purple frames and I am am thrilled with the choice. I normally don't care for large lenses but I like these. I wear regular glasses and only wear my contacts once in awhile. I love that these sunglasses fit over my regular glasses. When the sun is burning out my retina, I don't even care if it looks dorky.\n\nThe metal is thin and has lots of flex in it. I don't think of it as flimsy though because they have quite a lot of give without breaking. It allows the arms and frame to flex to fit faces of different widths. The flexibility also allows them to sit comfortably without the clamping pressure some glasses can cause. I like the screw free design of the arms because for me, that is usually a weak point in glasses. Those little hinges end up bent  , broke or the screws fall out. At any given time, we have a couple of one-armed glasses or sunglasses laying around. The screwless hinges on these create a more solid connection between the front and the arm. These definitely feel different if you used to the thicker heavier plastic sunglasses. The first time I wore them I was unsure, but it didn't take long to get over it. They stop the sun from burning my eyes, stop me from squinting in bright light and are comfortable to wear.\n\nThese come with a microfiber drawstring bag as well as a square semi-hard box to store them in. I use both. I keep them in the bag to keep the lenses clean and then place them inside the box for breakage protection. You also get a microfiber cloth for cleaning the lenses. If you just prefer the smaller lenses, you might not like these. I didn't care for larger lenses myself, but since trying these out, they are my favorites now.

While  that usually causes design flaws, none could be found in these stylish and unique frames (see attached photos for screw free nose pads and temples) . I love the light weight, the high-low detail on the corners of the lenses and the subtle gradient lenses.\n\nI have a round face that makes finding sunglasses a tad difficult, but the style of these would look great on any face shape. And as a random side note: I wear thin framed small lensed glasses when I am not wearing my contacts. In my rush one day I forgot I had my glasses on, and through these sunglasses right on top. Funny enough, they fit! They covered my glasses completely and no one but me realized what I had done.\n\nThese glasses come in soft drawstring bag to protect the lenses, and then that bag comes in a rectangular hard glasses case. This double layer of protection keeps your glasses extremely safe when not being worn. A cleaning cloth was also provided.\n\nOverall: Stylish sunglasses that I won't hesitate to purchase again in different colors.\n\nI received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

I fell in love with it when I saw it online because the style and colors are so perfect for the occasion.  I have to admit I was uncertain about taking the risk of ordering it, BUT, I'm extremely glad I did!  My only advise is to make sure you measure yourself properly, as shown, and don't worry about what the size says.....go by the measurements.

You'll find these earrings available at a couple of low priced retailers for about the same price. Then you can see in person what they look like. I didn't do it that way. I just ordered them from Amazon.\n\nThe type earrings I 'needed' ~YKWIM~ to match a gorgeous real topaz and diamond pendant I own are at this time out of my price range. After finding these on the Bay and on Amazon, I ordered them here.\n\nRead the description here carefully. The jackets *are* gold plated sterling silver. The little CZs sparkle and appear securely set. I'm uncertain how good the gold plating is. Time will tell.  To my eyes, at least one of the the jackets I received is out of round. But not severely. It appears the craftsmanship is about what one might expect at this price point.\n\nRead the description carefully for the topaz earrings. The earrings are separate from the jackest. There is no description of the setting for the topaz earring setting securing the stone. The blue topaz stones are a deeply saturated Swiss blue. They are set in those cheap brassy thin jeweler's metals with a flat bottom and four sharp edged 'claw prongs'. The posts are about 2 mm shorter than posts on most modern earrings. The butterfly backs are teensy, but fit tight.  This is what we used to call a dime store type setting.\n\nFor me the blue topaz studs won't be wearable on any frequent basis because that tinny metal irritates my pierced ears. (And the posts are too short.) Maybe one day in the future I'll get a jeweler to set the stones in silver (vermeil) of standard quality. I'll being along the jackets if they last.\n\nI tried the jackets with my real .90 carat (each) diamond studs set in a solid tulip setting. No fit at all.\n\nFinally, I tried these jackets with a nice pair of good quality .50 carat (each) CZs set in a 6 pronged vermeil setting. Bingo! These jackets gave a nice halo effect to the bare CZs. Perfect fit.  Otherwise, these would be going back to the seller.", "summary": "Nice jackets", "unixReviewTime": 1437177600}

It really looked great with both.  The solid grey fabric really makes this a very versatile piece and Im considering ordering the black, as well.  I wasn't sure that I would love the shoulder cut-outs, but they are actually a cute feature.  Im happy to say that it fit my criteria:  its loose and covers everywhere I wanted covered\n\nAs far as quality, its decent.  I definitely wouldnt say its superior quality, but its not bad, especially for the price.\nMoving to the fit, I really like the fit, but I definitely want to talk about sizing.  As mentioned in the Amazon listing, the seller requests that you use the sizing chart provided in the pictures to the left.  This is very important.  Im typically a 10/12 in shirts (which equals a 2XL  yeesh), but I wanted to make sure that it was loose enough, so I ordered a size up (12/14  3XL).  Im finding the upsizing really wasn't necessary because I think it would have been plenty loose enough had I just properly followed the size chart.  So, when making your size selection, you may want to take that into consideration.\nGoing back to the versatility, I think this shirt will be very easy to dress up or dress down.  I can see wearing this very casually, or adding some jewelry, hair, makeup and making this looked dressy.  I noticed in some of the other reviews that there were comments about using this as a T-Shirt Dress.  I wouldnt recommend this, but this just my opinion.  For me, this is firmly in the shirt category.\n\nOverall, I am very happy with this shirt and will likely purchase this item in black.  I do want to tell you that I purchased this item at a reduced cost in return for my honest review, which I worked hard to do.\nIm going to attach a picture to this review to illustrate fit.  I think it looks a little large (since I sized up and probably shouldnt have), but I still love the look and comfort of the shirt.", "summary": "Great Tunic.

It's really a nice dress and price, especially for the cloth material and build. Things to watch for is that the lace is sewn on a bit loosely, the silhouette is a bit off from the picture- the sash sits way higher than the natural waist, and you will definitely need a bit of tailoring.

I normally wear a petite size 4. I'm 5 feet tall and weigh about 115 lbs...this is just to give you an idea of my size. I thought for sure a small size would fit me. I could barely get it over my shoulders. I drove to Walmart which is way out of my way (that's why I ordered through Amazon) and thankfully I was able to find the last two Scooby costumes with one being a medium. My arms aren't that huge, but it was still a snug fit around the armpits for a medium size.\n\nBTW, when you take off the costume, I found it easiest to bend over and slowly pull it off. The arms take the longest because the fabric isn't that stretchable and you might have a harder time pulling those out. Maybe I just have big hands...???\n\nThis costume is made in China, so this small is probably accurate for them. Not for us. We have more in the hip area to cover among other places.\n\nOverall, it's a cute costume and I got a lot of compliments on it. I added a blue bow to one of my ankles. The hood won't stay on your head on a breezy day. You might find glitter from the tutu to stick to your face. Not a lot...just a little. Took off one star because the size is not accurate.

Good dress if sized up! I would say the dress runs at least one size too small. I'm normally a size 6, but just had a baby a few weeks ago, so am more likely a size 8 now. I'm 5'4\" and weigh 145 (usually 135) with an athletic build and a size 34E chest. I ended up ordering two sizes up to a 10 in the short sleeve version of the dress and it fits perfect! I wanted a more loose fit like pictured on the model rather than skin tight. If it's skin tight it will show any belly you have rather than hiding and flattering like in the larger size. Also, be warned that the dress does shrink considerably when dried in the dryer! Oops! Thankfully I tried it on beforehand. One other thing that bugs me is the way the wrap part lays across the chest. The line from where the chest part attaches under the breasts to the top of the shoulder does not match up when you put it on unless layed exactly in place and then it doesn't stay there, so there will always be a fold-over somewhere along the line. It's hard to explain, so I've attached some pictures. It's not terrible, just strange. Lastly, the top is wonderful for a breast feeding dress! It stretches out easily and goes right back to shape. I have actual nursing tops that don't work as well. So, if you're nursing, this dress is definitely good for the price just size up!\n\nPros: Very comfortable, super stretchy, love how the v-neck accents the chest but is covered enough to still be modest, fantastic for breast feeding!\nCons: One size too small, thin material so light shows between your legs even indoors, strange lay of wrap chest part, shrinks in dryer", "summary": "Has some issues, but GREAT for breast feeding!!", "unixReviewTime": 1444780800}

However, the case gives it that extra protection if you use it, and don't want to put it in a bag or purse. Great for travelling.\n\nThe zipper case makes an excellent stand. I use it on my bed all of the time, and it works GREAT. Please note that side of the case that the iPad snaps into needs to be the side that is at the top when using it as a stand in order to stand as it shows in the pictures.\n\nI would highly recommend this to anyone needing that extra protection.

In fact, do not get the one size if bigger than DD even if band size is as small as 32.\n- do not expect support, good for lounge wear or sleeping for large cup sizes\n- I like the idea to wear over a bra for a camisole look\n- get rid of the pads.

I ordered a Small I usualy wear a Medium but I wanted a tighter fitting shirt so I went with the Small and it fits just as I'd expected its not as tight on me as it is on the model in the picture since I am not as muscular as he is I am about 5'9\" 131 lbs so the fit is perfect not skin tight like I was affraid it would be. The color does not match the color in the picture though the one in the picture is a bit lighter then the one I recieved which is more of a Navy Blue but its fine its not a big deal so just know that the color may be darker when you recieve it so keep that in mind other then that its a Great shirt I will update this later on after its been through several washes to see if there's any shrinking or color fading.\n\n(Next day UPDATE)  Just took the shirt out of the dryer had it on the lowest setting this is the first wash and dry and the shirt did shrink nothing major but it is a more form fitting shirt now then it was before still a little loose in the hips but it is a bit more accurate to the fit on the model in the picture and same goes for the sleeves a snugger fit on the arms. If I was a bit more muscular it would be an exact fit as shown in the picture which is awsome, but from now on I will be hand washing and airdrying this shirt to prevent further shrinking as of now theres no obvious fading in the color I will update if that changes.", "summary": "Great shirt super soft and a perfect fit", "unixReviewTime": 1447027200}

You can tell a lot went into the craftsmanship and the materials are excellent. The woven finish definitely brings a level of sophistication to the piece and the stitching is flawless. The reason that I deducted 3 stars was because it suffers from a huge design flaw that no wallet of this caliber should ever suffer from. Because this is an 8 credit card wallet, it's 4 cards per side. They card slits are horizontal and so when you fill this wallet with cards, it sits closed flush and has a tendency to twist because the area of contact between to the 2 sides is too small. What this means is when you pull the wallet out of your pocket it has a disheveled look to it because it is presented as \"crooked\". I'll live with this flaw but I won't buy another like it. I'll be stuck with this wallet for some time and I am ok with it because it is nice, it just has a messy look because the credit cards touch each other in a staggered formation when closed. This is \"teaching\" the leather a dis-symmetry that I will be fighting for the rest of the wallet's life.\n\nI am including 2 pictures to illustrate my complaint - One of a side view to show how the credit cards sit against each when closed and one of the wallet a rest to show the effect of the design.\n\nIf Montblanc or the Amazon seller wishes to rectify this I am welcome to do so and would restore my faith in these companies, however I fear they likely won't respond and I'm stuck with a fancy wallet that looks sloppy.", "summary": "Beautiful wallet, poor design", "unixReviewTime": 1455926400}

Boutique bras made for petite ladies in small sizes are insanely expensive. Bras made for teens in small sizes tend to be too narrow, and the cup placement is too close to the center. Padded sports bras sometimes work, but they tend to make one look flatter. As Goldilocks would say, this one is juuuuust right. If you don't need \"support\" and can't deal with underwire, this is a comfy, stretchy bra that's just slightly padded and naturally rounded.\n\nI've bought several sets of these and wear them everyday. My size is 34AA, so I was looking for a bra that would primarily provide nip coverage with a natural looking shape. I really like that the pads are triangle-shaped instead of a big circle. A lot of similar bras on Amazon in the same price point are too baggy, padded, or rounded so they look very unnatural with clothing.\n\nDon't put these bras in the dryer, as that can ruin the padding. I put these in a small lingerie bag and then hang them to dry. No need to hand-wash though. Sometimes the padding shifts around, but there are small openings where you can reach inside and adjust the pads.\n\nAnother note: The \"nude\" color is a typical pale skintone color, but the \"natural\" color is a bright orangey peach.", "summary": "The perfect bra for petite, flat-chested ladies", "unixReviewTime": 1450569600}
