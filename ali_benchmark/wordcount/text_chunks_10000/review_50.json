Turns out these are those same shirts, or at least the fitting is the same.\n\nI would order Large of most items (6'2\" 175lbs).  These shirts I get in medium.  A large would be way too long.  They say they are meant to shrink with washing.  I've never had one shrink a noticeable amount.\n\nThat being said, I'm not round,  So I look for shirts that aren't made for round people.

It stopped working so I started looking for a new one. I wanted to find a quality watch with the following characteristics: a unique and modern look, a good company/manufacturer warranty, and a functional time piece.\n\nAfter doing hours of research over a few days, I decided on this watch. It came with the two year warranty and is made by a German manufacturer. The Detomaso website is informative and the customer service was very quick to answer my question about a few other watches via email.\n\nFirst of all, this watch looks fantastic. The black finish combined with the red and silver highlights look very good together. The chain is also black and goes with the watch very well. I have been using it for about a month now and am very pleased. The Triplo has kept accurate time down to the second. The overall quality is excellent. The displays are very easy to read and the glass does not give off a glare under light.\n\nThe two smaller displays are used for other time zones. This watch features a chronograph to keep a running timer. The second hand for the chronograph is the large white hand with the T logo on it.  The large display contains three very small 1-hand faces inside of it. One is the second hand, one is the chronograph minute timer, and the other is a 24 hour clock. This watch has a very nice stainless steel casing that gives it some weight and sturdiness. The backside is all stainless steel (not painted black) with the Detomaso logo and name engraved/stamped into the steel.\n\nThe only thing I would change would be the chain clip. The concept is very cool and functional but it feels slightly cheap and breakable. If it were made out of a heavier duty material such as steel or a harder aluminum, I would feel more comfortable.\n\nIf anything else happens to change my review, I will post it here. Overall, this is an excellent watch that has met my every expectation!", "summary": "Finally, a good quality, modern pocket watch!", "unixReviewTime": 1437955200}

Even if the slip doesnt bother you, I might still recommend putting them on clips or another headband, just so you can have more freedom in where they sit on your head. You can achieve a lot of different looks with them depending on where you put them, which is great, but the strap can make it tricky to get them exactly how you want.\n\nThe look is cute, but there are very visible seams running along the sides of the horns. This is visible on all the photographs, so its not a surprise, but something to keep in mind. I was hoping Id be able to cut/sand them down, but because the horns are hollow and the seams appear to be holding the whole thing together, I'm afraid to mess with it too much. Im thinking of filling them with expanding foam to make them a little sturdier, but its not necessary. It would just make me feel a little more confident working on them and then toting them around.\n\nIt might be worth noting they are not perfectly symmetrical, which I think makes them look more natural, but I could see how might bother some.\n\nOverall, I like them. There aren't a lot of options at this price point, and they are alright given how cheap they are.

This is an actual corset and is very difficult to put on. You will either need to somehow slide it around after clasping it or ask a friend to help. Because the top fits snugly, I wasn't able for get more than 1/3 of it clasped on my own.\n3. Mesh back- on either side of the clasps on the back of the corset there are mesh panels. I was hoping to be able to wear this as a shirt, but it doesn't seem to be designed that way. In the picture you can see my hand and the tag through the mesh, and also note the clasps- there are 16 total running down the back.\nOverall, OK item.

I went to YouTube and watched some reviews of Jaragar watches and decided to pull the trigger. The vendor sent the watch out within 24 hours of order. Watch arrived with the estimated delivery dates. Watch was in retail box. Watch in a never worn condition. All push pieces, crowns secure, doesn't seem prone to loss. Crown that operates slide rule very smooth. All hands are oriented properly to their respective dials. Sweep second action of second hand extremely smooth. Luminosity is nil on all treated parts. Dial is hard to read, but this watch is for sharper eyes. No markings on the case back to indicate water resistance. I would not recommend committing the watch to any sort of exposure to watch. Case back has a plastic display window. Movement is roughly finished and clean. I have seen Miyota movement look worse. Beats of the hair spring are strong and consistent. The movement will need time to settle in, it is running at a gain of 38.9 seconds on day two. I do not expect a chronometer certification. Case is substantial, roughly 49mm in diameter will fill the wrist. Strap is well made, stamped genuine leather and manufacturer. Buckle signed Jaragar. I will continue to watch for similar watches offered by Hamimelon. This was a second purchase, and I received a little break off of shipping I believe because of it. I recommend this watch.", "summary": "Exceeded all expectations.", "unixReviewTime": 1415059200}

My little guy is 5mo, about 16lbs and 25\" long, and the 6m fits just like I wanted it to - comfortably through the shoulders, slim but not snug through the body, and plenty long (babies' shirts tend to ride up as you're holding them or they're on their bellies!). The fabric weight is moderate, not tissue jersey like Kavio's raglan tees (which we also have) but not as heavy as like a Hanes Beefy T. It is not super stretchy, it's not going to stretch out.\n\nNot cons necessarily, but things to be aware of:\n- The colors are not bright, they're pretty moderate; significantly softer than they appear on my screen. Cobalt is not a primary blue, more like a lightened navy. Caribbean is not a clear tropical blue-green but more beach glass-ish. The one exception of the six colors I have is the orange - it's what it looks like, strong (but not neon) slightly red orange.\n-If your baby has a high-percentile head circumference, this is probably not the shirt for you. The neck is a regular crewneck with no snaps, and as I said, it's not the stretchiest fabric. Average-headed babies should be fine though.\n-If you want a looser fit, you'll definitely want to go up a size, or if your baby is very chubby for his or her length. This is a great shirt for average to skinny babies. I recommend consulting the size chart rather than going with your baby's age.\n-I can't comment on the durability. They seem well-constructed and don't feel cheap.

It has a definite 1920's vibe. The bottom of the  Pretty Guide Gatsby dress I purchased from Amazon is scalloped, with gold sequin \"lines\" that reiterate the shape of the bag. The purse looks really cute with the dress, so I kept it. I think the gold color should be more \"antique\", but that is a designer/manufacturer issue, and a matter of personal taste.

They have another version that IS plus size, however. Overall, I think the dress itself is great - I'm just not sure how I feel about it on me. First of all, I'm 5'9'' and finding a maxi that actually goes to my ankles is difficult to begin with, and this one is typical in that regard; It probably sits about 2 1/2 to 3 inches above my ankle. It's made well, especially for the price (I've been doing a lot of bargain shopping on Amazon lately, and in general, I'm pleasantly surprised at the quality), and is a nice buy for people on a budget.\n\nAlthough this dress comes with a built-in slip, it's not enough to disguise underwear (at least with the white color) so you'll either need to wear nude undies or purchase an additional slip to wear underneath. As someone else said, the tie for the dress is the same color and material as the dress - which doesn't bother me at all. The company also threw in a free, cute necklace when I bought it. Not sure why, but it was a neat surprise because no other company on Amazon has done that for me before! :)", "summary": "Listed as \"Plus Size\", but it's incorrect.", "unixReviewTime": 1403654400}

I bought it in size small and it was extremely comfortable. However, as usual, you get what you pay for. This is definitely a good trench coat for the price. However, I had a trench coat from Express that cost twice as much I was considering as well. I waited until this one was delivered and eagerly tried them both on for comparison. I really really wanted DJT to win but sadly, Express was the clear victor. It was just much heftier, better fitted (ie made me look slimmer) and better quality overall. The other thing I didn't like about this coat was that the material seems to have some sort of micro glitter in it. it's barely obvious but I don't prefer it. Also, the belt is a little too high waisted for my taste. Overall, I would recommend this if you are on a budget. Normally I would go for the cheaper option if the only difference is the brand. However, I really want a coat that will last me for a few years to come and I figure, I might as well spring for the option that is much more likely to last through several wash cycles.", "summary": "This fit of this trenchcoat was actually really great.

If you know your measurements and you use the size chart provided, the jacket will fit. Do not order a Medium because you normally wear a medium T shirt. It doesn't work that way.\nI sized up to a large due to reviews saying the jacket ran small. My measurements put me in a medium on the provided size chart. I am 5'9, 36 bust 27 waist and 39 hips. The Large was huge. I exchanged for the medium (which I would have initially ordered had I followed the size chart). The medium fit well; It fits in the shoulders but is a little loose in the waist and looks frumpy. The sleeves are even a little on the long side, again I am 5'9.\nI am exchanging again for the small. I have an hour glass figure and I am willing to have it a little tight across the shoulders if it will be more fitted through the waist as I will be wearing this for a more formal look over dresses. If you have a larger tummy or breasts don't size down. Just follow the size chart.\nObviously I really like the coat or I would not be exchanging this many times.

The sweetheart neckline is pretty & simple. The pleated details is as image, may require some steaming/light pressing once received. The dress is soft, super flowy and the mermaid skirting starts approximately 12\" from hips (approximately 1.5\" under one's behind). The dress is pretty long (extra 5\"-6\"), and i took it to a tailor to get it shortened (ends 0.5\" extra to heel height) and once i tried it on, i noticed the proportion of the dress was off. I'm 5'3\" and curvy (bust 36\" and hips 39\"), the shortened mermaid skirt did injustice towards the dress which then looked out of shape & awkward in comparison to the pleated part of the dress, plus it made me look shorter than my actual height and my behind appeared to pop out more than naturally. What was a very feminine, chic, sleek and figure-flattering dress when i initially received & tried on, turned out to be a stumpy, 3/4 tight dress with a loose chiffon skirt hanging around it. I really like this dress, simple, beautiful & at a somewhat fair price, and would recommend contacting seller for a tailored fit/measurement. If not possible, then i would say this dress is made for taller than 5'3\" ladies.", "summary": "I really like it, but", "unixReviewTime": 1449446400}

Having said that, I would advise prospective buyers that this company is based in China and a bit of patience may be required.  I love their boxer/brief style with a small cloth waistband.  This type has the rubber embossed \"wantdo\" logo on the outer  front.  I accidentally ordered the boxer/brief with the large \"HERO\" logo waistband and I returned it as I don't like large elastic waistband, and there's apparantly another style with a large waistband with a printed 'Wantdo\" logo.  They have many differing styles under a single page on Amazon's site, so choose carefully.  On top of that, they don't have all styles/sizes in all colors so it's tricky picking out the style one prefers in the color of choice.  Also, when I received my first order, they were XL size.  I had ordered M (medium).  I wrote to the company to arrange a return and received an email from a representative who suggested I first try them on as they were Asian sizes.  To my amazement, they fit perfectly.  I have a 32 waist and usually wear a medium.  The quality of the product makes all this a minor inconvenience and I didn't even mind paying $18.00 per pair, which I have never done before.  Maybe I am just unaware, but I don't know of any American apparel company making underwear of 95% Modal, (a fiber derived from bamboo), 5% spandex (so comfortable!) with a perfectly designed shape to accommodate the male anatomy and look so good at the same time!", "summary": "Amazing Underwear!!", "unixReviewTime": 1430697600}

The dress fits just perfectly now, the length is also right, below the knee, and it sits right on my waist. Not sure it would be good for somebody taller than me, the waist of the dress will be probably too high. Though the dress fits nicely it still would look better size up.

A few notes, however:\n1. This is a 'slim fit' shirt. If you are looking for a loose or baggy fit, this is not the shirt for you.\n2. The fabric is not as thick as the picture looks. Sorry, this is more of a knit shirt than a sweater. If you want something to keep you warm in cold weather, maybe try something else.\n3. The collar has to be styled in order to stand up. It's little more than a sewn on flap. You have to fold it inside in order to get it to stand like it does in the picture.\n4. Asian sizes run smaller than US sizes. I'm 6'1\", 150 lbs, 30\" waist with a very slim build and a medium is a casual fit. I plan on ordering a small because I like my clothes form-fitting.\n5. Keep in mind that the photo pictured here is on a mannequin with athletic measurements and with a man's face and hands photoshopped on. It will not look like that on you unless you have an athletic physique.\n6. The collar is a bit wider and not as tall as pictured, which I actually wound up liking more anyway.\nA note about care: Do not ever put this in a dryer, the materials are not designed for it. Add extra spin cycle to your washer and this puppy will come out nearly dry. I took it straight from the washer, hung it up for a few hours and it was ready to wear. Shipping was faster than expected (10 days as opposed to the estimated three weeks)\n\nThe only con I have to mention is that the shirt does not come with extra buttons in the event that one becomes detached or lost.", "summary": "Don't expect miracles", "unixReviewTime": 1448928000}

I don't know if she received it or if she likes it or ifshe will wear it, but I like it very much. The skull is quite large & heavy with beautiful flowers & swirl designs all over it. It is definitely a necklace, not a bolo tie, like the picture appears. I wish that I could wear it, but I'm allergic to metal. I'd order one for myself & display it on my wall, if the price goes back down to where it was.\nI recommend this to wear to nice events where you don't have to move around a lot, not jogging or dancing. It would hurt very much if it hit you while running, but would come in handy if someone was in your bubble & makes you uncomfortable! Irrecommend this for a teenager or adult female, not a male, because of the exquisite designs. It is not a glitter that gets all over the place. I don't recommend this for a young child, but only because it is too heavy for them & the long chain would get caught in their backpack straps or on the swingset, etc\nIf you want to buy it like I did & give similar but different designs for, say, your daughters, or for best friends, look for the skull bow tie mask design necklace & there are others. This is not a cheap looking skull, though, I personally don't think that the chain is attractive.

As mentioned, I've ordered this exact necklace before, and it was beautiful. Unfortunately, this one looks sloppily put together. Taking a close look, I noticed that many of the \"stones\" are shoddily glued in. They aren't even in place. There's a clear setting where the stone should be, and most of them are glued halfway out. And obviously so. Furthermore, some of the finer metal details on the upper attachment (above the moon) are broken. I'm very disappointed in this purchase.

I'll be honest that I was worried with a larger order of so many small items that the seller might forget one or two items when shipping, but they were all there when I got the parcel. Some of them do need a smidge of DIY TLC. Have some superglue ready in case of pieces falling off (trust me, pieces will never fall off again). Really, though, even with a little assembly needed for SOME of Yazilind's products (only 3 out of the 10-15 I ordered even needed any altering), you're getting some very nice jewelry for the price! I get compliments on my bracelets, necklaces, and wrist cuffs all the time! It's my little secret that they were less than $5 each! The only part of the pieces I received I didn't like was that the bracelets are lobster clamps - so hard to get on by yourself! I feel like pull ties would be much more manageable, and probably look better, too. I will probably find some threads for them and replace the metal chains on the bracelets with pulls instead when I get the chance. Other than those few small complaints, all the items I received from Yazilind were as pictured, comfortable, and very charming. I'd definitely suggest this item as well as other similar pieces in Yazilind's collection.", "summary": "Large Yazilind Order (General Review)", "unixReviewTime": 1453680000}

I'm reviewing each of these dresses (see a list of them at the end):\n\nAbout me: 5\" 2 tall  / weigh about 152 pounds / bust - 94 cm (37\" ) / waist - 82 cm (33\" ) / hip - 110 cm (43\" ) / shoulder - 40 cm (16\" ) / floor length - 143 cm (57\" )\n\nSize  - it is very important that you use the measurement given by the manufacturer in the description. I ordered this and the dress  fits perfectly. I use US size 8 or 10 or medium; I measured myself beforehand to check with the manufacturer size table. Also have in mind that if you are well endowed, I would recommend to order a size bigger .\n\nThe chiffon is very nice and of good quality and the color is wonderful...they say it's light blue, but is more a light greenish tone love the color! - this dress is a classic one and makes you feel very feminine and slim; I really liked. Fits so nicely, but I was looking for a floor length dress and did not paid attention to the length they gave of 138cm so it ends a little higher than my ankles...would be nice it it was just a little longer. The buttons could be of better quality and most probably if I kept it would change for some more fancier...it's an easy fix!\n\nThe inner layer (lining) is a non-stretch knit, but very soft and comfortable; the lining does not go all the way down...it's up to the knees.\n\nDresses I also tried:\n\nEVER PRETTY ELEGANT V-NECK LONG CHIFFON CRYSTAL MAXI EVENING DRESS 09016 - 10US - RED\n\nEVER PRETTY EXQUISITE BROWN CASUAL DRESS FOR GIRLS 09016 - 10US - BROWN\n\nEVER PRETTY ELEGANT PARTY DRESSES WOMEN 09102 - 10US - BROWN\n\nEVER PRETTY SEXY V-NECK CROSS BACK RHINESTONE SHADE LONG EVENING DRESS 09735 - 12US - BLACK\n\nEVER PRETTY GLAMOROUS GREEN DOUBLE V-NECK RUFFLES PADDED EVENING DRESS 09890 - 10US - WATERMELON RED\n\nEVER PRETTY GLAMOROUS GREEN DOUBLE V-NECK RUFFLES PADDED EVENING DRESS 09890 - 10US - BLACK\n\nEVER PRETTY GLAMOROUS GREEN DOUBLE V-NECK RUFFLES PADDED EVENING DRESS 09890 - 8US - PURPLE\n\nEVER PRETTY EPIRE WAIST PLEATED RHINESTONE VE NECK BRIDESMAID DRESS 09449 - 10US - SAPPHIRE BLUE\n\nEVER PRETTY EPIRE WAIST PLEATED RHINESTONE VE NECK BRIDESMAID DRESS 09449 - 10US - PURPLE\n\nEVER PRETTY EPIRE WAIST PLEATED RHINESTONE VE NECK BRIDESMAID DRESS 09449 - 10US - BLACK\n\nEVER PRETTY FLOWERS ONE SHOULDER CHIFFON PADDED EVENING DRESS 09768 - 10US - RED\n\nEVER PRETTY LACEY NECKLINE OPEN BACK RUCHED BUST EVENING DRESS 09993 - 10US - BLACK\n\nFANCY DRESS STORE HOT IRREGULAR CHIFFON FULL SKIRT LONG EVENING WEDDING PARTY DRESS SLEEVELESS - ONE SIZE  - LIGHT BLUE\n\nSEXYGGS WOMEN'S BOHEMIAN CHIFFON SLIM ROUND NECK SLEEVELESS LONG DRESS - SIZE 10 - LIGHT GREEN\n\nVON VONNI WOMEN'S TRANSFORMER DRESS LONG - ONE SIZE FITS ALL - GRAY\n\nLQSHOP LQ INFINITY STYLE MULTI WRAP CONVERTIBLE LONG DRESS - MEDIUM - BROWN\n\nLQSHOP LQ INFINITY STYLE MULTI WRAP CONVERTIBLE LONG DRESS - MEDIUM - TAUPE STRIPE\n\nKOH KOH WOMEN'S COWL NECK DRAPE FRONT SLEEVELESS MAXI DRESS - MEDIUM - NAVY BLUE\n\nKOH KOH WOMEN'S SLIMMING KEY HOLE SLEEVELESS MAXI DRESS - MEDIUM - LATTE\n\nSAKKAS STORE FOC1-1008 PAISLEY ON SOLID BLACK GRAPHIC PRINT V-NECK CAP SLEEVE EMPIRE WAIST LONG MAXI DRESS - ONE SIZE - TURQUOISE\n\nZEHUI BOHO WOMENS CHIFFON MAXI DRESS SUNDRESS - 10US", "summary": "Wonderful Color and very nice dress", "unixReviewTime": 1406764800}

They have a nice amount of stretch to them so they move with you and would accommodate people of differing sizes up front. The pouch has a nice shape and good size. I'm still not sure the color description is accurate. The photo makes them look blue, the description says green, but they're sort of a super dark olive color.

I also had to wear a small jacket due to being backless at work. Beach ready fine. The material flows well, I like that stuff, viscose polyester or something like it.

They were surprisingly careful about my order, making sure that the measurements I sent them were correct (I have odd dimensioning).  I wanted the coat to look as close as possible to the one worn by Willem Dafoe, so I asked them to make a red liner which they did for free.  The fit is excellent.  My wifes first words upon seeing it on me were that coat fits you perfectly.\n\nThe coat as delivered had almost a suede like finish, but an hour or two with some Meltonian black shoe polish made quite a difference.  Now it has a nice even sheen to it.  Im sure that further polishing with a harder shoe polish would make it even shinier.\n\nThe belt included was way too long for me, so I will have a seamstress make it shorter.  The coat has two internal and two external pockets.\n\nIt arrived only about one week after I placed the initial order, much faster than Amazon predicted.  Overall I am very pleased with this coat.

I originally ordered because of its super cute style and affordable price. However, I wasn't sure what kind of quality it would be for the value that it was. But as soon as I received it and tried it on I saw that it was actually great quality and incredibly comfortable.  I would definitely say that the Small fits more like an XS but that was fine for me.  I would recommend sizing up though accordingly. The bottoms were great because they came right up to my natural waistline. Often times, high-waisted things don't fit around my waist quite right - either resting too high or too low.

She said she was a little nervous wearing her diamonds around foreign countries without me there, but she wanted a wedding band.

She says it's very comfortable and elegant, and she likes that the design goes all the way around so she doesn't have to turn it constantly.  It's accurately sized and has the comfort band feature with the rounded edges.  Awesome.  If I didn't love my ring so much, I'd probably get one for myself.

I mean, you get the jist of what they kind of look like with the picture. They are a gold color, they are rings. But, studying the larger ring that, in the product picture, has roses and leaves on it, There is really no design.\nLooking up close and knowing what it is supposed to look like, you can see leaves, but not like in the picture. The ring is also misshapen. It is not a consistent shape, looks a little bit squashed from the sides. I will still wear it as it kind of has an abstract theme since it looks like it never had a design in the first place.\nThe twisted ring looks more like the picture as is has a simpler design. It is still not as nice as the picture. The other ring is fine, a simple small band thick toward the top as you wear it.\n I am a size 7 in rings, normally. The larger ring only fits on my pinky. The other two don't go over the knuckle on my pinky finger. But the small plain ring fits on my ring finger but not past the large knuckle. I don't mind because I needed pinky rings anyway.\nI am giving this 3 stars because I still like them even though they do not live up to my expectations at all. They look pretty on and with my other rings. For the price, I wasn't expecting much anyway.\nStill disappointed because I really like the design in the picture.\nI probably would not recommend", "summary": "Set of 3)Golden Ring Flower Leaf Ring Golden Woven Band Ring", "unixReviewTime": 1411948800}

I chose this watch because it is not so expensive that I am concerned about damaging it when working in the garden or working on some home repairs.  Not like a Rolex or Tissot, or Omega.  Bottom line, it is an automatic which means no dead batteries.  Another plus it looks good, the strap  is heavy and will take wear, the case is heavy duty, has a Sapphire crystal, and best for me with poor eyesight I can read the date.  The ability to read the date without a magnifying glass was the feature that sold the watch.  I have some expensive Swiss watches , and the dates are too small to see.

Color is very good and really good luster...honestly.\nIt's equal to a $70-$80 strand from JC Penney's/Macy's, IMHO....and I wouldn't be surprised if my wife sneaks them out, LOL.", "summary": "Color is very good and really good luster", "unixReviewTime": 1404691200}

I like to wear my skirts super high-waisted, with a couple inches of skin showing underneath my bust line.

I am a 5'6 female, 130lbs, and I got a size medium. I am not large-chested - I am a 34B, and this top shows underboob. If I lift my arms up, my breasts will fall out of the top entirely. My boyfriend finds this both horrifying and amusing.\n\nWhat the top really needs is an elastic band at the bottom to hold it in place, but it does not fit tightly around the bust line at all. I have remedied the problem by wearing a basic black bralette underneath it. The top tends to ride up to where my nipples are regardless, but with the black bralette underneath, you can't tell that it has rode up unless you are up close.\n\nThe material is soft, and the top otherwise fits well.

I really, really did. And despite reading some strange reviews, I took the gamble of buying it considering it was only $15 and came with free returns.\n\nThank goodness for the free returns because there is no way I'm keeping this dress. The color is the single good thing about it. They are exactly as pictured and very lovely.\n\nThis is a trapeze style dress and yes, as another review mentioned, it only has one arm hole. She didn't get a defective dress (as I had imagined); that's how it's intentionally designed and made. The neck-tie at the top effectively creates the other arm hole once it's tied. However, in order to get the arm holes anywhere close to the same size, you have to tie the neck tie uncomfortably tightly, and even then they don't quite match. It doesn't come with a belt, so I threw one on to try to get it to look like the pictures. Ehh...not exactly.\n\nI'm 5'8\" and this was WAY too short on me. For the 10 minutes I wore it and took these photos, I was in serious danger of flashing the landscapers.  No way I'd ever risk wearing this in real public. The fabric is extremely light-weight, which adds to the wind dangers and extreme static situation I was battling (and it's 84 degrees and humid here!). Despite being so light weight, it is definitely not breathable and I would be very uncomfortable wearing this on a warm day. Also, the print on the fabric doesn't match up from front to back.

The seam is obvious ad though it doesn't look bad, it is not what I wanted.\nThe strap across the back of the dress looks like it should be thin and hit high close to the nape of the neck. False, in actuality the strap is a little over an inch thick and hits more like lower shoulder line.\nThe backless aspect is also very disappointing, the dress is backless however not nearly as deep as pictured, it dips about halfway down the back.\n\nThat being said, the dress is well made.

The style is very cute and feminine. It has big brown buttons as opposed to snaps. The fabric is a nice pattern and the color is true to the picture. It's lightweight and 'swishy' but not plasticky in texture. The hood has snaps in case you would like to remove it. It's very comfortable and fit like I'd hoped. I am 5'6\" with a 26 inch waist, and a Small fit me with enough room for layering and movement. I suppose some people may want it a little tighter around the waist, but it's no where near the flowiness of a full poncho. More importantly, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this jacket. I immediately put it under some running water and was really impressed when the water just beaded away. I'm not sure what prolonged rain might do, but the water resistance it had was very promising. I am completely satisfied with this item. It's fashionable and well made, and I absolutely recommend it.", "summary": "Looking forward to stormy weather!", "unixReviewTime": 1408233600}

I bough mine in pink, but it is a touch different compared to the picture. It's more of a soft and pale peachy pink than a light or baby pink, but it's still lovely. Could easily be worn in both the spring and fall because of its color :) It is a bit lighter than your average \"winter coat\", but since you'd probably be wearing heavier clothes underneath, and/or a scarf during that time of the year, it would work just fine. One thing that is important to note is that it does run small. I'm 5'2\" and 128lbs, and going by the size chart, and my usual size I would get a medium. However, since I know that Asian sizes tend to run quite a bit smaller than US, I was convinced after reading the reviews to buy an XL. It fits just perfectly in this size, so my advice is to get one 2-3 sizes bigger than your norm, (depending on your shoulder size too because it can be a touch more snug there.) Overall, this coat is cute, stylish, and casual all at the same time. I love that it's not bulky at all, and can easily be worn with a heavier piece of clothing underneath. So if you're looking for something along these lines, this could be a potential choice :)", "summary": "Very cute!

The pockets are acceptable as well. Back view is cute too. VERY Happy and a great buy.

Two hours later, it was still working, so I took it off and set it aside.\n\nAt 4PM, he looked at it on the counter and said, \"It's 12:00 again,\" meaning this lovely piece of technology reset itself with no one touching it.\n\nThis is garbage.

There is a zipper on the back of the dress, it camoflages perfectly with the back of the black dress. No issues with the zipper getting stuck. Only issue I have with the dress is the strange smell.

Ive gotten so many compliments over it.  Its not really a common design for your average one piece swim suit.  I love the fact that the front hangs over my mid-section and doesnt conform snug to the body.  I refer to it as my beer suit.  Living in Hawaii, beach barbeques are very common.  This suit allows me to eat whatever and consume as many beverages I want without me being self-conscious of holding in my gut.  It allows you to just feel free and enjoy yourself without having a care how far your belly sticks out because you cant see it.  It fits snug around the bottom half kind of like a mini skirt so it still gives off the appealing factor of wearing a bathing suit.  Another plus is that it reduces the area you need to lather yourself up with sunscreen.  If you know the Hawaiian sun, you need to reapply sunscreen a few times if you're planning on staying out.\n\n** PROS **\n1.  Very fashionable.\n2.  Unique design.  Ive never seen anyone with this style of swim suit.\n3.  Covers your mid-drift.  No sucking in your belly required.\n4.  The suit is well made.  Its been through many washes.  Crossing my fingers it lasts forever and never gets damaged.\n\n** CONS **\n1. Nothing bad to say about this swim suit.  Ive worn it at least 20 times and washed it in the wash and it still is in great condition.  I still get compliments every time I wear it.", "summary": "** Overall comment ** I absolutely love this bikini dress", "unixReviewTime": 1458604800}

I definitely love when sellers use prime great packaging and fast shipping. After reading the other reviews I decided to order a size a up and I'm glad I did.  This suit runs small but ordering a size up fit perfect for my bottoms.  The top however was to small and not very supportive at all but I usually wear a 36ddd so it's hard for me to find tops that fit in general.  The material was soft and not to thin which is wonderful a swim suit that's see through is not a good thing especially for me.  The stitching was good and seems to be really good quality.  The color I ordered was pink and it's very vibrant and beautiful.  The twist top is very cute and if it fit I believe it would be very flattering.  The straps are made to be removable so you have the option of strapless another positive. The snap in the back of the top also seems like it would hold up nicely even being to small in had no issues with breaking or seam ripping. I'm giving this swim suit five stars because the quality is great,  ordering a size up fit my bottom perfectly and the fact that the top didn't fit was my own fault.  It's a beautiful swimsuit and I plan to wear the bottoms with a different top.  I'm very pleased especially with the very affordable price now a days good quality for a good price can be hard to find.  I certainly recommend this suit but would advise ordering big because of Asian sizing.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the sizing is all off. The bottoms and the tops appear to have been randomly picked and do not reflect a single size as a set.\n\nWhen this suit arrived, I had high hopes. It is beautiful in terms of the cut and colors and style. I have to be honest and give the suit credit for it's attractiveness. But, the moment I pulled the suit out of the bag to try it on, as soon as I stepped one foot in one of the legs a button flew off of it and across the room. Seriously, across the room. No biggie, I could sew it on later...\n\nThe bottoms fit ok. They were fine in the hips and the butt, but the leg openings were a bit too snug and the waist was too loose. The suit bottoms came up about two inches above my navel, but the waist band was just too loose so the bottoms would slouch down about an inch below the navel.\n\nThe suit top...wow. I wear an upper C/lower D (size 12 overall,) and I ordered the XL because 1. Asian sizes run small, 2. I order almost all of my clothing online and am very accurate when it comes to my own measurements and sizing guides, so I know what I need to order, and 3. I considered other reviews.  This top...again, wow.  This top is so small I cannot even begin to explain. It goes around me just fine and the shoulder straps fit well, but the cups of this suit are maybe for an A cup at best.  I literally came out below and above this suit. The inserts inside the top cups are very domed and I am not sure who has this shape of breast that would make this kind of insert ever work.  As I took the suit off, two more buttons came off.\n\nI had two friends try this suit on in the hopes I could pass it along to someone else. My first friend is a size 10. It fit her in the top as she is an A, but the shape of the cups was alarming. And, the bottoms fit like they did on me. My other friend is a 6/8. The bottoms fell off of her and the top (she's a B cup) was very awkward.\n\nI received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. Even at a discount, it is not worth your time, sadly.\n\nThis suit...", "summary": "The sizing is severely off and the two pieces are mismatched.

No one has ever noticed and I doubt anyone would care even if they did.\n\nFor fit, I'm a 5'11\"-ish woman with proportionally wide shoulders and this works well under nearly every one of my sweaters.

I am usually a size 2, 5'1\", measurements 34, 26, 36 and the small fit me perfectly. I am also a D cup and the inner lining fit me fine. I like the backless part of the dress although it is not exactly as pictured. The straps connecting at the lower back portion of the dress are not as spread out as they are in the picture, so it only really gives the appearance of 2 straps instead of 4. As far as material quality it seems fine. There are some frays in the lining but for the price I wasn't expecting perfection. I ordered the green dress and I wish I ordered the black. The green is not as bright as in the picture, just a regular dull green instead of a brighter almost sea-foam green that it looks like in the picture. I am giving this dress a 3 due to the fact that the color is not as expected and it will probably be see through in the sun so I will have to wear it as a cover up.

When I managed to force it down onto my head it just popped back up because it's too shallow (I am only 5'2\" tall btw.)\n\nThe fit is nothing like how it looks on the model in the item photo.  The size of the hat I received is more appropriate for a 10-year-old than a grown woman.\n\nOther than the size issue, the color was true to what was shown in the photo.

The material feels about wally world material so not to bad if you're a cheap-o like myself. But as soon as I tried it on I could tell it wasn't going to fit, it was tight around my armpits, needed about 3 inches to close and it was wwaayyy to short.

I give the concept and design 5 stars.  I am a die-hard Seahawks fan and I love to be able to show my spirit.  The Bradford Exchange allowed me to return the Seahawks bracelet and exchange it for the Seahawks Superbowl bracelet because I ordered it before the Superbowl - then they won and I definitely wanted the Lombardi trophy charm; however, it took at least four phone calls and I can't tell you how many emails to accomplish this. The charms are nice.  The football helmet is quite detailed.  The charms include the helmet, football, jersey, green and blue beads, hearts with the Seahawks name and crystal, Seahawks name charm and the Lombardy trophy.  I would give 1 star to the customer service department - intentions are good but the follow through is terrible.  The biggest disappointment is the quality of the materials used to make the bracelet - it turns my arm green and dark blue.  $120 for a bracelet that turns my arm green/dark blue? For the price of this bracelet, they should have used sterling silver or another metal that isn't so cheap instead of the cheapest silver plating around.

The detail is good with no obvious dust under the glass (it is at least glass and not some acrylic material) The dial is not printed but has actual hands and numerals that look like they have been attached as separate parts. Around the bezel are 4 machine screw heads which are also real, unlike some watches of this style that have printed or screened screw heads on the surface of the glass. The strap is supposed to be real leather? Its possible but the surface feels like no leather I have ever seen or felt before. All in all for $30+ it's not a bad watch at all. The strap will only fit up to an 7 3/4\" wrist, the 3 small sub-dials are non-working and I don't think it will stand up to a lot of abuse.

I tried them because I wanted low-rise long johns that don't reach halfway up your stomach while the crotch sags halfway to your knees. These don't do either of those things. But I did want them to be warm, which again, they are not particularly. The cargo container in front gives room so they don't crush you, but they don't sag either. The stretchy material leaves all the room anyone might need to accommodate the typical expansions and contractions that naturally occur. They are styled, cut and stitched so that they hug your buns and fill in the gap and hold to your shape, so they work well and look good under jeans. It took a bit of getting used to the feel of them at first, but not long, as they feel quite nice against the skin and they look good too. To be honest, they almost feel like they gently massage your legs and bum. Im not sure Id like to be taken to jail or the hospital in them though.\n\nPros:\n+Fit great.\n+Feel great.\n+Inexpensive.\n+Dont, won't & cant sag.\n+Dont bind, constrict or crush.\n+Work well and look good under jeans.\n\nCons:\n-Not thermal underwear for warmth", "summary": "Wasn't so sure at first, but I'll buy them again.", "unixReviewTime": 1456272000}

The quality appears to be excellent, there are no rough spots on it and the ratcheting and release mechanism work smoothly.\n\nI bought a brown belt, wishing that it were a little darker than pictured. The good news for me is that it is indeed a good bit darker, I'd call it dark brown.\n\nAs this is my first ratcheting belt, I was very conservative in cutting the belt to length while trying to keep the excess to an acceptable length. I may yet cut off another inch or so to get it right. It does appear that you might need to leave a little more length than some other belt types to ensure that the buckle mechanism can engage the ratchet strap. I'd highly recommend buying a longer length than you might normally wear to ensure you have plenty.", "summary": "Great Belt and Buckle", "unixReviewTime": 1405728000}

As other reviews have said, they do ride up a little on the thighs but again, not really a deal breaker. I don't anticipate it showing from under clothing.

I am 5'5\" and 112lbs, and the small fits perfectly.  They have the right amount of stretch and don't ride up in the back when bending over, so I won't have to be in the back row of Yoga class. :-)  The little pocket in the front waistband is a nice touch - not sure I'll ever use it, but it's a nice size and would hold a house/car key (but probably not a ring of keys), and maybe a few dollars folded up and/or a credit card or ID.  I got these shorts in both pink and blue, and the colors are just slightly more intense than the picture shows (or it could be that my monitor makes them appear a little washed out in the photos), but they're still pretty true to the photos in terms of color.  I will probably order a few more in different colors.\n\nNOTE ABOUT OTHER REVIEWERS comments about the sizing and 'cameltoe' issue - ladies be realistic about your size. I think all sizes are beautiful and I have some very curvy/voluptuous friends that I envy, so this is not a body-size criticism, just a comment about figuring out what size you should order.  If you are under 5'6\" and weigh over 125 lbs, a small will cause cameltoe problems. Order a medium instead. The material is stretchy, but even stretchy materials have limits. Several reviewers who complained about the small being too small (and listed their height and weight) my first thought was \"well I'm not surprised, they should have ordered a medium, not a small.

It drapes nicely and allows for a certain level of customization. The rouching around the waist enables the length to be adjusted within a span of several inches. I love this dress!  It's so soft and comfortable.  My only complaint is that it's super long, but I am 5' 2\" so that's always been a problem for me.  I would've loved to wear it with flats but I will need to wear 4 inch heels with this dress. It can also be manipulated in a way that conceals your waistline or accentuates it. I'm quite busty (34-D) yet the top doesn't give me a plunging neckline.\n\nThis was the 1st PattyBoutik item I bought and wow! I was super impressed! Since then, I've purchased dozens of items from this brand and they've become a major staple in my closet. This investment has made outfit planning so much easier and I am now able to get ready and dressed much more quickly.\n\nConsistently, these garments are made from high quality, soft material. I appreciate how they aren't see through (although I've heard that some of the shirts are but I've never experienced this with any of the ones I own).\n\nAdditionally, I love the way they're cut: They seem to be designed for women with curves. Most clothes look funny on me as my bust and rear are larger and my waist is small. Subsequently, many shirts, sweaters and dresses either don't fit my chest or make my waist look big. This brand hugs all the right spots... And without looking trashy or over revealing.\n\nAlso, the rouched accents on many of the tops and dresses are very forgiving, which makes them ideal during the post-pregnancy months. With that said, these details do NOT add extra weight or bulk. I think the designer of these garments must be a brilliant individual who understands women's bodies well.\n\nLet me clarify: Yes, this brand is made in China. And I'm pretty sure it's actually a Chinese company as well. But please be rest assured that there are NOT cheap \"MADE IN CHINA\" clothing. Patty garments are a great value and come with a certain level of quality that I have come to appreciate greatly.\n\nI've been telling all my friends about Patty!!!", "summary": "Super comfy and pretty dress!", "unixReviewTime": 1460246400}

However, after wearing it a few times, the ring turned my finger a muddled, unsightly brown color, which is quite odd - I am not certain whether this was the finish wearing off, or whether this was because of a chemical reaction with my skin (yet, I am positively sure that if it were the latter it would have turned that all too common green color).  Overall, I rated this item five stars though because of the prompt service, shipment, and reception of the bracelet/ring - it was certainly in good condition, and was listed with a great cost and free shipping - hence five out of five stars.
