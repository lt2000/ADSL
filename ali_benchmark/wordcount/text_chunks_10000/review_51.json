I even wear it to work at Dunkin' Donuts.\nThe ring is very classy and small. It goes well with my promise ring that is rose gold with a heart shaped stone. The three little hearts are so cute and stand out on even my pale peachy skin. Simply the best buy if you're looking for something simple and cute.\nAlso as the description says, it does look rose gold.\nAs for size, I bought what I thought would fit my middle finger and it fit.

The material is light and breathable while the fit contours to your body. The side straps rest gently on the hips and do not dig in with the thong strap itself is hardly noticeable. The first pair purchased was a size to small, but that was because I failed to look at the size chart, the second pair were perfect. They are great for daily wear while at work, or for more strenuous activities such as running, biking or even yoga. The design which allows air to get between the fabric and the body keeps you cool and dry making these both a fashion statement as well as a great addition to your collection whatever the purpose.\n\nThe price is what seals the deal in that in todays underwear market for men. When the average thong or jock can run you close to $10, finding a comfortable thong for 60 - 70% less is a steal! Then when that garment turns out to be made with quality to last wear after wear and wash after wash you cannot beat it. I have purchased each color twice because of how comfortable these are and how versatile they have become. They work well for everyday for the office, while working just as well running on the track. Not to mention their flexibility in the yoga studio or fashionable to wear with a nice suit or tux on the town (mainly for the fun after the event). Highly suggest these if thongs are your style or if you are looking to give them a try. Most people sneer or laugh at the thought of wearing a thong, but in most cases they have never tried it.

It was obviously made to order, judging from the residual chalk lines for button hole and strap placement. The construction is just immaculate though. The fabric is a nice solid cotton broadcloath and feels fantastic and the shirred backing is very forgiving.\n\nSo you might be asking yourself why isn't this a 4 or 5 star review? Well there seem to be some issues with the grading of the sizes, If you were not an xxl this might fit better, or maybe if you go for the custom sizing. But for the xxl that I received the straps are like two inches too short. We are talking the sides are all up in my armpits and the waist of the dress is an inch or two above my waist on my body! Not so flattering with full skirted designs. Also while there are darts at the waist  there's no tapering above the waist... so if you're busty like me there's going to be a lot of extra fabric flapping around the top edge of the bodice.\n\nI'm sure after I get it back from the tailor who is doing alterations is going to be an adorable dress. If they fixed their large sizes I would definitely buy another of their dresses.\n\nSo if you have a stick figure or want to try the custom sizing, this is an excellent deal.\nIf you are curvy, expect to pay for $30 worth of alterations, but even then it is a pretty good deal for the cost.", "summary": "Very Acceptable", "unixReviewTime": 1357344000}

The sequins where coming off and the belt around the waist was sloppy stitched. The Sleeves were so long that they hung 5 inches past my finger tips. I am 5'8 size 12 so could not even imagine how it fit on someone that is petite. On a positive note; It was easy to send back and I found two other dress on Amazon that fit and looked very classy.

The fit is as I expected, and my 13yo son loves it.\n\nAfter reading other reviews, I will likely give it a vinegar/water soak before washing in case the colors aren't set.  At this price range, I would think it prudent to do what I can to keep the colors vibrant.  Also, it is 100% cotton and a bit rough-feeling (which to me equates to sort of a cheaper-grade cotton) so I am expecting it to shrink if I don't wash in cold.  It's okay, I've got room for it to shrink, but again, I am reserving the right to come back after washing to update my score.  But my son loved this shirt so much, he put it on immediately, so I'm likely not getting it back for a few days.  LOL.  I will report back!\n\nREPORTING BACK:  The colors were fine.  I soaked the shirt in probably 2 quarts of cold water with a cup of vinegar in it before machine washing just in case and forgot about it for 2 days.

I was walking her down the isle.  She wanted me and the mother of the groom in a salmon or fleshtone colored dress to match the one pink flower in her bouquet.  I specifically emailed this company my bust measurements as well as my measurement under my busts when I ordered the dress.  When the dress arrived it was too small...I could not close it in the back.  After contacting their customer service and going through emails it turned out they had given my measurement of under the bust as the bust size.  They offered to make me another one and at my own expense for shipping, mail it to me..me keeping the one that was ruined.  I thought maybe that would work...I would need to redye the dress since when it arrived it is not the coral or salmon in the picture it is a peach, like a sherbert peach. I\"m a seamstress so I knew the top of this according to the picture would fit well on me being busty.  From the picture it looked like the top would be very comfortable and not at all stiff. When it arrived the bodice was so lined with thick heavy duty lining that it was stiff with no give in it, the sleeves were lined with the same horrid lining.  I figured when the other dress arrived I could take the lining out myslef, hem it appropriately and then dye it with some RIT dye and make it a more salmon color.  Of course I also only had two weeks till the wedding.  I told the customer service person to not start on it that I wanted to think about it some more.  After sleeping, I opted to change my mind and not have them make me another one. I thought the fabric was a bit on the cheap side for such a gown as is in the picture.  The chiffon on it is definitely of the cheaper kind making the dress very heavy and 'off the rack' looking.  You almost hear a raspy rustle when you move in it...the sound of cheap fabrics.  I would be too stressed awaiting it and would spend more money because I would need to buy another dress in the event the new one arriving was not the correct size.  Their customer service was very nice until I told them I was changing my mind on having a new one sent to me.  They changed the return terms for me...I had to return the dress and would take a hit on the shipping, what it cost when I ordered it and I would also have to pay for my own shipping to get it back to them...in CHINA!  That would be approximately $65.00.  I've been a single mother for 20 years...their father did not help with this wedding or my other daughter's wedding...like I told the CSR person...I did not have returns to China per their mistake budgeted into my wedding money.  So I sit now on a loss of $140 including shipping and a dress that will never ever be worn.  All because they put the wrong measurements into the dress. I will never purchase something like this out of our country ever again.", "summary": "like a sherbert peach", "unixReviewTime": 1436745600}

I had been looking for a compression tank top for my son and there were many to choose from. I decided on this one because I thought I was going to get 2 in the package. The picture shows two shirts. Two of the exact same shirt. The same picture. Not the front and the back. Not the front and the side. The same picture. Plus- the name of the product has a number 2 in it. Since we were going for quantity and not necessarily quality, we decided on this. I was so excited that we were going to get 2 shirts for about the same price as others were selling 1.\nHowever that is my fault. I should have investigated it more. But oh well now we own it.\nMy son wanted a compression shirt because he feels that his \"moobs\" (man boobs) are too big. I can't see them. But he is uncomfortable wearing t-shirts by themselves. He will wear a hoodie even if it is a hot day. He can wear a large or even an extra large shirt. So we thought getting a large would work for him. He notices that if he sticks or Puffs out his chest, he notices the compression more and feels that it is doing its job. But if he is relaxed and just hanging out, he doesn't feel like it is small enough. He wore it the first day, and he liked it. But when the day was over, he really didn't know how he felt about it anymore. And he hasn't worn it since. I think if it was just a little bit smaller it would be perfect. We like that it is a tank top that way he can wear it under shirts. But he will probably have to wait either a few months or a year so he can grow a little bit more to fit into it.

My bathroom doesn't afford me a drawer or shelf where I can keep my makeup. Instead, I have everything in a bag and have to work out of it every day. Every. Single. Day. So keeping things organized and accessible is a necessity. I've gotten so tired of riffling through a tall makeup bag searching for that eyeliner that's on the very bottom, and it seems that's how the vast majority of bags are constructed. But this one is different. It opens all the way around so I can see everything at once! It's also just rigid enough to hold its shape (so things don't fall out), but pliable enough to zip closed even when I've shoved another eyeshadow palette into it. In the zipper pocket on the lid, I keep about 5 eyeliners. The clear zipper bag that was inside holds all of my brushes. I threw away the little mirror as I have a much better one that I just use for travel anyway. And then in the main compartment I have: a bottle of liquid foundation, an undereye concealer, mascara, eyelash curler, eyebrow gel, powder, bronzer, highlighter, two sizable eyeshadow palettes and 5 liquid shadows. That all fits easily IF I leave the bag with the brushes separate. Or I can put that inside if I take out one (very large) eyeshadow palette. And even with all that in there, I can see and access all the products easily. Nothing gets buried at the bottom. Oh, I do keep all my lipsticks in a separate bag because I have a lot of them, but I would guess 2 or 3 would easily fit in the main compartment.

Once it was on it fit correctly, but it wouldn't fit anyone bigger than me. It is incredibly short so theres so way you could wear it out without leggings or pants. The model in the picture must be 95 lbs because thats the only way this dress will fit someone like it does in the picture.\nAnyway, the skirt poofs at really strange angles too- in the front making you look way bigger than you are, rather than the back (like it does in the picture). It would take a ton of styling and messing with the top grey layer to make it look like it does in the picture of the back where it has 3 tiers.\nIt took a good amount of time to get here but thats because it came from China so Im not complaining about that.\nOverall I would NOT recommend this dress.

The colors are faded and the shirt has that old rustic look which blends well with the \"old fashioned\" appearance. As a Large wearing person, I went for the XXL so it'll be baggy for a night shirt. However, my brother tried this on as an XXL wearer, and the shirt fits quite well. It's a SLIM fit shirt, HOWEVER, only in the arms from what we've gathered. There's no extra baggage underneath the armpits, and the sleeves fit relatively close to the arms, but very comfortably. The material on this shirt is decently thin and very lightweight. It's quite forgiving with movement and doesn't smother you, or make you feel stiff.\n\nAll in all, it breathes very well, has a comfortable worn look & feel, and doesn't make me feel uncomfortable if I wear it to bed, or to the store.", "summary": "\"Blue\": worn appearance & feel, well worth it!", "unixReviewTime": 1511568000}

The fit works pretty well. However, the swimsuit isn't particularly flattering on pear shaped bodies. I see no \"slim tummy control\" to be honest. If anything, it made me look a little chubbier in the midsection. I have other much more flattering swimsuits that I'll probably stick with until I lose a few tummy pounds (waist ~28/29). This is definitely a push up though; there was a thick underwire in there as well as removable padding. This doesn't pack well because of the underwire and padding. It's actually quite bulky, not ideal at all for light packers traveling on a plane. Takes up about as much room as a pair of jeans. This won't be going with me to Australia, unfortunately for these reasons.\nImportant point: the skirt isn't really a V shape like in the picture, it's more of a straight across which is fine but also makes it a little less flattering. The undershorts are great, not too tight and not super loose. The back looks pretty, but I'm a bit unsure if the clasp will hold up since I haven't swam in this yet.\nI can upload a picture of myself in it later if anyone wants to see it, just leave a comment. The color is a pretty bright red. The swimsuit itself came in a super handy thick reusable plastic zip pouch and also came with a nice random hair tie. I would definitely buy again from this seller but would not recommend this swimsuit itself if you're a little chunky in the midsection. If you're slimmer in that area, I would definitely say go for it if it's still about $18.", "summary": "Meh.", "unixReviewTime": 1429401600}

Lots of sequins, and the silver around the bust and back really sets it off. There is a second layer underneath the skirt area that has a very subtle sparkle in it.

It did arrive way ahead of schedule which i was excited about, until i opened it that is. I ordered it strapless and corset back. They did the corset back fine however to my surprise, it still had straps. However after putting it on, I rather like the straps. The biggest issue i have with this dress is that it shows it as well as describes it as a sweetheart neckline but i received a straight neckline which changes the whole look of the dress and definitely not what i wanted. The bust is a lil big also but i was expecting something to that effect and to just fix that in alterations.  I have contacted the seller and hopefully they can correct all these errors and i will update this review.\nUPDATE:\nThe seller was amazing at making this right. They offered to pay for the entire alteration to do the neckline.  I am extremely happy with their handling of the situation.  Also, i must say, every alterations shop I took it to said it was extremely well made. Be cautioned however, they did such a good job at with the details that it will cost top dollar for anyone to take it in or let it out due to them having to remove the beautiful beading and lace, make the cuts along the seam, then put the beading back on it.  I think it will turn out wonderful and i can't wait until it's done.\n\nFinal update:\nThis turned out so beautiful.

The top fit me...just slightly a little loose, but I was able to tighten the straps around my back and neck. The top covers a lot of my chest due to me being small chested. I like the bottoms! The back of the bottoms are cheeky, but I love it! They have a scrunched look in the middle and it is cute. The strings on the top and bottom are long and if they are too long for your liking you could cut them and leave them how you want. The top is padded, but if you want them out you certainly can take them out (they are removable). The material is 86% nylon and 14% elastane, so there is stretch to them. The stitching is very nice and was made well. The insides of the top and bottom are line with a soft material!\n\nOverall, it is a nice bathing suit and I will wear it.

When put to a woman CEO of irreproachable integrity during what was a semi-formal, public event, my internal monitor ruled in favor of the mute button over a query that might be judged in bad taste or, worse, unacademic and impertinent.  The more I thought about it, the more I (like Hamlet) refrained from taking action.\n\nNevertheless, the question continues to nag--in direct proportion to white briefs that continue to sag.  It was Fats Waller who wrote the provocative, even profound, popular song most often associated with Louis Armstrong, \"What Did I Do to Be so Black and Blue?\"  The song is saying, \"Like it or not, my color is nothing of my own doing--I can't accommodate it to your personal preferences.\"  But is Jockey equally powerless to make full-rise white shorts that ascend to their wearer's expectations?\n\nBeing a student is, by definition, a continual lesson in humility, so I won't pretend to have an answer. I've tried enough brands to learn that the white shorts made by Fruit of the Loom and Hanes fare no better--if anything, both are worse for wear than the Jockey brand.  There's nothing like Jockey black and blues to give a man the welcome feeling of starting the day off with a lift--that sense of having your act together even before taking it on the road and hitting life's always-challenging next stage.  But I refuse not to purchase white shorts along with the colored ones (we all could use a little more humility every 3rd or 4th day).", "summary": "\"I'm white inside, but that don't help my case...\": Pops was right, but Jockey's got your back with offerings in blue and black", "unixReviewTime": 1410220800}

Based on the reviews and the company sizing chart, I ordered a medium, although I am a US 2P. I have slightly broader shoulders than the average 2P, and medium shoulder width looked to be sufficient. When I got the shirt, I was pleased with the color and quality for the price. I put it on and took a few photos, noting that the shirt is as not slimming to the waist as it looks in the photo. Definitely a bit billowy. Matched with a skinny belt or a pencil skirt, I knew it would be fine. But then I tried to take the shirt off.... and got stuck. There are no buttons or zippers to help you with the shoulder width and the fabric has zero stretch. After several yoga moves, I managed to get the blasted thing off, but now I'm scared to wear it. However, if I went up another size, I'm certain the billowy look would have been that much more pronounced. So now I'm stuck, figuratively, with what to do with this blouse.

I'm not really a tan/brown person but I got it to go with a new pair of tan shoes. I liked the bag so much that I hunted it down in black. I like nice things but generally don't spend so much money on accessories. This bag, however, is worth it.\n\nThe leather is butter-soft, which makes it wonderful to touch and allows the bag to easily shape to the body as it hangs from the shoulder. The bag is really quite large, but doesn't feel or look enormous. I can put a file folder and/or my small laptop in it with no problem, yet I don't feel like I am carting a shopping tote around with me.\n\nThere are several pockets on the inside, which is the key to a good bag IMO. The pocket on the front goes all the way across and the magnetic snap on the front flap keeps it from feeling like anything in that pocket will fall out.\n\n**Update, January 2015** I have used this bag almost exclusively since I got it. It's a great shape and size for me, BUT the silver finish is wearing off of the buckle on the front pocket flap. I am very disappointed - I paid way too much to expect  this kind of wear after just a few months.", "summary": "Expensive but worth it", "unixReviewTime": 1402012800}

I was amazed at how fast I got the package (it seemed like only a week).  The Bad:  I bought XL for the extra length because I am 5'7\", 145 lbs (36B) but when I put it on, the front of the top did not even reach the bottom of my crotch!  I bought this to cover the upper thigh area (that many of us women have trouble with) while wearing leggings and although the back of it is plenty long, the front was a total disaster for that purpose.  The Ugly: To get the shipping wrinkles out, I moistened the fabric with water and put it in the dryer to get the steam to remove some of the folds.  Lo and behold, when I took it out after about 10 minutes, the seams at both armpits were coming apart (about 1\" of the way down) and the fabric had shrunk so that now the top only hit my belly button in the front!  Now, if you ironed it I am sure the \"shrinkage\" would disappear but I'm not an ironer and don't want that hassle.  ACKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK.  I am sending it back.  2 stars just because I think the seller is good, but the product is a 1 IMHO.  P.S. It is NOT cotton as the description states.  It is some type of synthetic material.\n\nUPDATE 8/24/14:  After several e-mails back and forth, I was not able to get a full refund from the Seller (Jetest-US).  They are very friendly and respond quickly but will only give you a 50% refund but don't need you to send the item back (so you can keep it and give it to someone very short LOL).", "summary": "If you are over 5 feet tall and want it for length in the front, RECONSIDER!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1408320000}

First I removed the underwire, which was rather uncomfortable. Removing it was super easy. I just stretched the material tight over the end of the wire on the inside of the swimsuit, and using a sharp razor blade, made a very small slit and pulled the wire right out. There is enough padding in the bra part of the suit to make it look good without the underwire.\n\nThe second modification I made was the straps. They fit just a little too tight since I'm somewhat taller and they are crossed straps. I removed the straps and reattached them uncrossed and now it's completely comfortable. That modification did take 20-30 minutes, but I'm not very skilled at sewing.\n\nAll-in-all, if I swam more often I would definitely buy a couple more of these swimsuits in different colors, even knowing that I would need to make the above mentioned adjustments.", "summary": "Trust the sizing chart.", "unixReviewTime": 1434412800}

I actually today bought another one for my younger sister, in the watermelon red color, because I think that it was modest enough for my standards. I have personally tested it over a sink and in a pool, and the material is good and absorbs the water.\n\nWhen the package came, I opened it up and found the color to be almost identical to the color in the computer screen picture. I was actually pleasantly shocked, because I hear lots of stories and reviewers say that the color was a little bit off from what they have been aiming to buy. The only thing that didn't work for me was that the place for the bra, or the widening on the top was a little bit too big for me. But that varies with every woman's body figure, so I would recommend actually measuring yourself carefully before you buy, so that you don't miscalculate it(I believe that the measurements are in the information box above). The material feels very bathing-suitish and so that it typical.\n\nI would just like to comment on the shipping, it took the suit more than one month(a tad over that) to get here, because this is manufactured in China. This depends on where you live, but I live in America so I would recommend that you order this is May, or before the summer months even start, so that you have the suit the first time that you ever enter a pool. This shipping time frame was actually a big thing for me, and might be a big thing for you too, because I had to have this bathing suit by a certain date, so that I could pack and so to my camp with it.\n\nThis is very modest, and covers your whole body, so if you have certain standards or guidelines(like I do for my camp) this should fit the bill, because it isn't revealing at all. Also, under the skirt there are normal pants, but the skirt just covers over that.\n\nI would recommend buying this, if you are interested in keeping a more modest approach to your swimwear.", "summary": "I have bought this tankini because my friend recommended and linked me to it", "unixReviewTime": 1436400000}

I got about a month's worth of use out of it.  I loved it while it wasn't broken so I was pretty sad when I noticed it was torn.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nI received the hot pink tote and I really like that it's not gigantic, nor is it too small.\n\nUnboxing:\nThe bag was in a soft white disposable bag and there was plastic wrapped around the handles.  However, this plastic was STITCHED into the top of the bag.  I had to use tiny scissors to free the plastic from all four points where the straps meet the bag.  You can still see little bits of plastic from where I couldn't cut it close enough.\n\nFirst impressions:\nLOVE the color, it's bright and vivid.  I like the tan contrast with the hot pink.  The little wallet is a cute touch.  It has a zipper closure on both the tote and the wallet.  There is one zippered pocket on the inside of the tote and 2 non-zippered pockets on the opposite side.  The lining is a thin black material.\n\nPros:\nGreat size to use as a purse without looking like a crazy lady carrying something the size of a suitcase to the grocery store.\nThe bag has a zipper closure keeping your belongings safe.\nThe wallet is attached to the tote so that meas it will never be left behind somewhere.\n\nCons:\nHaving to cut away the plastic that was protecting the straps during shipment.  Usually this plastic is just wrapped around the handles and is easy to remove but this was actually sewn into the purse.\n\nOverall impression:\nSince this won't be my main purse (I'll only use it when I'm wearing something that matches) I'm thinking it will last me quite sometime.  However, I would heed caution if you are planning on using this everyday.\n\n*I received a sample of the Faux Leather Medium Tote from HDE at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.

Stitching could be better, as you can see in one of my pictures, if you pull gently, as a too full bag might, you can see the stitching isn't reinforced and would likely rip if packed heavy or tight.\n\nLooks cheap, feels cheap, but smart structure with the pockets to keep key items easily accessible and I like the top zip, often missing on similar shape\\quality bags.\n\nWould be easy to brush off dirt/sand.\n\nI recieved a sample in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.

This organizer fits snugly in my bag.  But due to what I have to carry with me and the shape of the bag, which is somewhat bigger at the bottom, it's hard to distinguish the pockets because it squished in there.  It may not be quite as stiff as it looks in the picture but again that could be because of the shape of my bag.  I may be giving it only 4 stars because it's not exactly what I wanted, but again that may be my handbag.\n\nNow the pros.  It is very close to the purple that shows in the picture if you care that much about the color.  It has the 4 pouches on the outside on both sides.  And another 4 net pockets over those.  The center is plenty wide and there are zippers on the full length of the top on both sides.  So it does have several pockets but they are all fairly large each being half the length of it.  I would prefer some smaller pockets on one side to hold things like pens, etc.\n\nI would recommend  it all things considered.", "summary": "A good organizer for your handbag.", "unixReviewTime": 1403568000}

It has held up great over this time period and is still in great shape.  I really love the material, it seems to handle getting wet better than a leather wallet, as it doesn't really soak in the water.\n\nIn the id window slot I keep my license and a transit card behind my license (that I just swipe without removing it).  I keep two smaller cards and a big door access card that I don't need to remove in the back pocket.  Then my debit and a back up credit card in the middle pocket, and my main credit card in the front pocket.  So about 8 cards total.\n\nThe only real con is that the ID can be a pain to remove if a place requires that you remove it.  It just takes a bit.  I don't need to remove my id often, and I'd get the wallet again, so it isn't a big deal to me.  I'm guessing if I did it more often the id sleeve would get a bit looser, and this would be less annoying over time.\n\nIf this one ever gives out, I plan to buy another just like it!", "summary": "sinfree@gmail.com", "unixReviewTime": 1492560000}

The 12 round stones are larger than I expected, and the changing mechanism looks very secure and it's easy to work.\nI have to admit that I spent probably 20 minutes playing with the different stones, putting them in and out of the pendant. It's amazing how the same pendant can look so different with a different color stone in it, and it's amazing how fast and easy you can go from having a ruby pendant to a sapphire pendant.\nInside the box a small key was included if you don't want to use your nail to open the back to switch the stone.  A Lifetime warranty also came with the pendant, along with an instruction page.\nThis is probably the perfect gift as you can stop guessing as what color stone you should get.

I normally wear a 2/4 and sometimes 6, depending on brand. This was too large for me. For this style of dress, it won't look good if it's too small or too big, so I really think they need to market it to a specific size instead of making it seem like it fits a variety of sizes. The material also just feels cheap. The straps also fit oddly. There is no stretch in those either, so they won't move with you. They are adjustable, but it's not practical to adjust them every time you want to move a certain way. Very unhappy with the product. I was so excited about it, too.

The shorts are decently made, fit my son like a glove and are long enough to extend down to his upper knee area.

Think chiffon (if you wanted to use these for your hair, think back  to when you were little and your mom put scarves on your head). But I was thoroughly disappointed - they are THIN/SHEER so just like any other scarf you'll need to double up by folding it width wise. Unfortunately that doesn't leave a lot of material to do much with. I can't make this an infinity scarf around my neck because it's too short and I can't wear it on my head in those super cute styles to protect my natural hair because there just isn't enough fabric.

One notices immediately that the face is unusually large, so much so that it might even look too big on a man with slim wrists.  On a muscular arm, it looks impressive and certainly eye-catching.\n\nIt has an aura of quality and sturdy reliability.  The buttons are easily accessible and work reliably.  The main reading has an hour hand, minute hand and second hand.  On the right is a date display and on the left is the second time zone reading.  Very handy for people who travel abroad, as it completely eliminates the annoying and sometimes confusing procedure of changing to the local time back and forth.  Given the partial dial, this second time reading is approximate as regards the minutes but, for precision, one can refer to the minutes on the main dial. The booklet of instructions covers nine watch models, but the SH159 is not one of them.  I found that the closest model is the QTM2.  In any case, operation is fairly simple.\n\nTo change the date:  Pull out the largest, central crown (on the right hand-side) a very small amount (first position) and turn to set the day's number (14 for the 14th day of the month).  Push back to set.\n\nTo adjust the time:  pull the largest, central crown out fully (second position) and turn to set the time.  Press back in when done.\n\nTo set the secondary time (for a different time zone): Pull out the left knob and turn to required hour setting.  Push back in to confirm.\n\nStopwatch operation:  the starting position should be zero.  Push the top knob (A) on the right to both start and pause or stop the count.  Press the bottom knob (B) to reset the chronograph hand to 0.\n\nI like the lightness and comfortable feel of this watch on my wrist.  Despite its imposing size, it does not weigh down my wrist and arm.  It looks edgy and reminds me of a rugged Diesel watch.  The quartz movement is precise and the watch does not require rewinding.  The miniature battery which powers its movement is said to last approximately 2 years, after which it should be replaced by an authorized dealer.  It is rated 3 ATM, which means that it can take splashing and rain, but should not be immersed in water.\n\nI love the leather strap, with its easy adjustment (the holes are straight slits, very easy to engage) and I generally like the look and the feel of this watch.  I was asked by the vendor to evaluate a sample watch for review purposes.  The reason I have withheld the fifth star is that, to my ageing eyes, the readings are very difficult to discern.  The hour and minute hands are grey over a black face and the only stand-out hand is the yellow second hand.  Also the main watch dial only shows numbers for the hours 7, 8, 10 and 11.

Got her this for Valentine's Day when she was away, and now that she's back in town, she finally put it on for me. I gotta say, it was sexy as hell. Having said that, it was pretty cheaply done too. I mean, there was some major fraying thread hanging from the bow on the chest, and why was the bow on the panties in the front? It's supposed to be in the back on the actual character and in the item pics too! Hmm, maybe she put that part on wrong, I don't know, but she knows the characters well, so I can't imagine why. Well, the bottoms weren't on for long anyway, and it still looked amazing while they were. I suppose the fraying threads are easily clipped. As for size, well, they seemed perfect for her, but she is quite petite. Not exactly short, but a fair amount shorter than me (I'm 5'9), and pretty much physically perfect (small but not too small on top). I have no idea if I'll see her in these again ever, so I don't know how they'll last or even how they do in the wash, but if someone took the time to fix the frayed areas, they are darn sexy, and I'd so love to see her in some of the other Scout outfits, ha.

I may just hand sew in liner myself.\nMy only complaint for this product was how poorly it was put together. The bows aren't even sewn on, they're two strips of fabric help with a little elastic on the chest and bum. A good portion of the thread was fraying out, and the stitiching wasn't even even for the white ribbon on the sailor piece.

Not sure if best for yoga, as the length and flare is more dressy. I do wear with flat boots running around doing errands. Careful washing, use stain remover on real stains. Wash on cold, and dry on low heat, except for first wash. First time I bought, I figured no size woukd fit cause of the length. I'm 5'5\", and that one wash shrank the length, but not the entire size. And although I have accidentally washed on hot and dried on heavy heat since, they don't keep shrinking or loose the thick quality. But if continue to wash on hot , will loose darkness.

Covers anything from being viewed but doesn't choke me. :) The only problem is that XS is only available in the scarlet color at this time, which is not exactly a color I can wear under all my low-cut tops :(. I will keep the scarlet because it's the only one available for now, but I really hope this style is not being discontinued and that Second Base will bring back the other colors in XS. PLEASE!! :) For reference, I have a 33\" bust measurement and wear a 32B bra. XS is perfect for me.", "summary": "PLEASE BRING BACK THE X-SMALL!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1494288000}

I kept these on my newborn inside the house for hours and it was a bad idea. His hands were wrinkly from sweat and his feet smelled from the sweat as well.

{"overall": 4.0, "vote": "4", "verified": true, "reviewTime": "11 4, 2017", "reviewerID": "A3MNMPRLQBSS5J", "asin": "B00K8UVPM4", "style": {"Size:": " Large", "Color:": " Burgundy"}, "reviewerName": "LifeIsGood", "reviewText": "I purchased  the Microfiber Organizer Cover with Study Kit (Size Large Color Burgundy), as well as the Deluxe Organizer Bible Cover with Study Kit (faux leather) (Size Large Color Burgundy) on October 22, 2017, so this review is based on the information given on Amazon's website on that date and based on the covers I received a few days later.  Sometimes Amazon starts selling the same product by a different manufacturer, or the manufacturer makes some changes, but the listing info isn't changed.  For that reason, I clarify that the information here is as it was on October 22, 2017.\nNOTE: When I purchased them, the listings said \"White Dove\" and no mention of \"Dickson\". But when I clicked on \"Buy it Again\" from my orders list a week later, the Microfiber one comes up saying Dickson, instead of White Dove.  Same dimensions and info, and the picture looks identical.  The listing was White Dove when I bought it and the card on the cover I received says White Dove.  The faux leather one now says \"White Dove by Dickson\" on Amazon.  The card attached to the one I received says only White Dove. No mention of Dickson on either Bible cover I received, but that doesn't necessarily mean they aren't the same covers now as the ones I received.\n\nThe microfiber case and the faux leather case have almost the same design, so, for comparison, I will review them as one, mentioning differences. The fabric from which they are made is different of course.  The microfiber is a sturdy cloth that has a sheen to it, almost like nylon's sheen, but heavier and nicer.  It has white stitching for detail, while the faux (fake) leather cover has burgundy stitching that is not noticeable.  You can of course tell it is not real leather, but it's nice.  On the faux leather cover, all the zippers and zipper pulls are burgundy to match the cover. On the microfiber cover, all the zippers and pulls are burgundy except the pull on the smallest outside compartment, which is shiny metal with a cross on it. Very attractive.\nColor - I ordered both in burgundy.  They are dark burgundy, with the faux leather one being darker, looking almost dark brown.  The colors on my computer screen are very true to life for both covers.  The card attached to each cover states they were made in China.\n\nDO TAKE NOTE, IN CASE YOU'RE BUYING FOR A MALE:  The card attached to the microfiber  one says \"LADIES DELUXE ORGANIZER\".  Why it specifies for ladies I'm not sure, unless the manufacturer thinks the white stitching looks more for ladies, and perhaps the fabric with a sheen. The faux leather one definitely does look more masculine, but a woman would be comfortable carrying it as well.  If you remove that card, there's no information anywhere.  Each case came in a clear plastic bag only - inside a shipping box of course. I mention this in case you are giving it as a gift.\n\nSIZE - At the time I purchased, the Amazon listing for the microfiber cover said, way down below under Product description:  inner dimensions 9 3/4 x 6 3/4 x 1 3/4.\nThe faux leather deluxe organizer said, right up in the description near the top, for size Large: Bible cover measures approximately 10.5 x 7.5 x 2.\n\nBased on those measurements, I expected them to both comfortably fit two identical Bibles, measuring 9 5/8 x 6 3/4 x 1 5/8.  When I received the covers, however, the cards attached to them said:  Large fits books up to 9 1/2 x 6 1/2.  No depth was given, but these measurements are definitely smaller than what the Amazon listing told me.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, both covers were too small and the zipper would have chewed the corners of the Bible cover if we had tried to force it.  If I had to guess, I would say the 9 1/2 x 6 1/2 inches is probably accurately what this size Large covers will accommodate, though I didn't have a Bible that size to try it.  I definitely do not think they would accommodate a Bible 2 inches thick.  If the width of the Bible were less than 6 1/2, then perhaps. 1 3/4 inches thick?  Maybe, but I can't say for sure.  The microfiber cover seems to have a little more \"give\" than the faux leather one.\n\nOn both, when you unzip the Bible compartment, it has the usual panel on each side to slide your Bible cover into.  The microfiber one had a built in ribbon bookmark. The faux leather one did not.  Neither one had a pen holder in the Bible compartment.\n\nWhen you unzip the notepad compartment, it has a steno notepad (VERY few sheets of paper) on one side that measures 8 1/4\" (from the top of the spirals) by 5 1/2\". The cards say the steno pads measure 9 x 6.  When it's time to replace the pad, you can use a Jr. Legal Pad if you prefer. There is a slit at either end of the notepad compartment, so you can turn the pad upside down and turn the cover the other way, putting the Bible in the other way, and thereby have the notepad on the left side of the Bible instead of on the right side of the Bible, for left-handed people.  It works fine either way.  BUT: do realize, the notepad is separated from the Bible by a flap, since the Bible and notepad are in totally separate zipper compartments.  So if you leave the Bible inserted in its compartment and the pad inserted in its compartment, you would have to flip back and forth, back and forth to read from the Bible and then write on the pad.  Or, you could remove either the Bible or the pad from the cover while writing.\nAmazon sells other covers that are tri-fold (three fold), which means the notepad folds out to be beside the Bible, so you can take notes without having to remove either the pad or the Bible.\n\nThere is one elastic pen holder beside the notepad.  On the other flap of the notepad compartment, there are pockets that run across the short direction of the cover, so that they won't be upside down no matter which way you use the cover - left handed or right handed.  They will always go side to side.  These are narrow pockets, some narrower than others.  They can be used to hold pens, markers, highlighters.\nZipper close these two compartments, and we will look at the outside of the organizers.  The back is plain - no pockets.  There is a handle on the spine, made out of the same material as the rest of the cover. There is a zipper pocket on the front, with a smaller zipper pocket on top of the larger one.\nThe larger pocket measures barely 7\" x 5\", with rounded corners  It has a double zipper so you can unzip it all the way to the bottom on both sides and completely open the flap, which, if you do, would allow whatever is in it to fall out easily. My Samsung S7, which is in a sleek/low profile case, fits easily. There is room for something else beside my phone, such as a comb and lipstick. A 6 inch ruler would fit nicely in this compartment to use for underlining.\n\nThe smaller pocket on top measures about the same size on the outside, but the straight zipper only opens 4 3/4 inches, plus part of the compartment is up above the zipper.  It is smaller on the inside than the other compartment.  I cannot get my phone in the small compartment.  It would be good for keys, credit cards, cash, or other small items. And again, a 6 inch ruler would fit in this compartment - if you angled it in.\n\nBoth covers come with 4 highlighters (green, blue, orange and pink) and a ball point pen, sealed in a little cellophane bag. The card says they are twist up dry highlighters, but I didn't open the bag.", "summary": "Nice Organizer Cover, but read my review about dimensions!!!!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1509753600}

The metal is malleable to hold more bills when folded.  You can even take out the clip if you just want to use that.

For such an expensive wallet, you feel good about using a high quality product backed by a decent company who cares about their customers.\n\nIf I had a criticism it would be that I personally wish the wallet would also come with scan protection, but if you are a nut about security than that option is open as well in another model.\n\nIf you're looking for a company with style and actual humans to speak with, look no further.", "summary": "They hand wrote me a letter wishing me the best on my trip and the wallet comes with a ...", "unixReviewTime": 1440288000}

The wallet hits some marks--good layout, size, organization.  It is slim, but not what I would consider \"Super Slim.\" But the big issue I have with it is that it sticks.  Cards stick in the slots, the license sticks to the plastic window, the wallet sticks together when closed, the pocket on the back sticks closed.  I have no clue why it does this, but it is a pain every time I use it.  My hope is that it subsides with time and use.  But I am skeptical as it seems as if the leather is treated with something and it feels kinda cheap.  I will try and follow up after a few months after it breaks in as it may just be because it is new.\n\nFor the price, if it stops sticking, I think this is a good wallet.  However, if you are looking for a nice wallet that holds up and are willing to spend more, I think that Hartman makes the best.  I have owned a lot of wallets over the past few years--J&M, Coach, Tumi, Bellroy and others, and the Hartman was the most durable and best quality IMO.", "summary": "I am a big fan of Johnston & Murphy products--I have one of their briefcases that I love.

I like a looser band, so this suits my purpose nicely.  I imagine it would fit even a nine-inch wrist or larger, but I have it cinched quite a bit smaller.
