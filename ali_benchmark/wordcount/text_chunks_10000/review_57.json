With these cheaper dresses I would rather them be too big because most of them are ok to throw in the dryer.  This one however actually ended up fitting perfectly.  The fabric is a thick jersey cotton and I would note that the black ruffle at the bottom is not a separate layer, rather it is all one layer and the black part flairs out.  I am writing reviews on a bunch of these cheap dresses from China after reading many buyers comments that they are dissapointed with the cheap quality and the thin material.  Some of these dresses are better than others.  This one is not overly thin... but as I have said in a bunch of these reviews, understand what you are getting.  These dresses are not highly structured pieces that will nip you in and shape you.  If you are not happy with your body shape and you have lumps and bumps that you want to cover, than these cheaper dresses are probably not a great idea.  However, many of them look pretty good if you put full slips or shapewear underneath.  The pictures are accurate for the most part, however they make the dresses appear to be very structured, which again, they are not.  The benifit to the thin, cheap dress is that it is not the end of the world if you don't like it and they are great for summer compared to your heavier weight structured pieces.  I really like this dress and will definitly be wearing it to work but again, I put slips and shapewear underneath it and understand that the dress will not create shape, it just lays on the shape I already have.  When I buy these cheaper dresses I usually add belts, cardigans, pantyhose, etc. which makes them pulled together and look a lot less cheap.  If you are looking for a very special occassion dress that is going to make you look amazing or help trouble spots, then these cheaper dresses from china are not good.  However, if you are happy with your body shape and just want to buy some fun pieces to add to your everyday wardrobe, then they are a great option.", "summary": "Understand what you are getting", "unixReviewTime": 1422230400}

I would always buy a cheap pair for $10 because I knew I would loose them or break them.  I would go through around 10-12 pairs a year.  Then I decided to get a good pair of sunglasses, I was thinking Oakley's.  So I went to the store, to be honest I had never heard of Maui Jim before that day, and tried on all sorts of sunglasses.  I had the pair of Oakley's in front of me and was prepared to buy them.  Then I saw the Maui Jim Banyans.  I was intrigued, so I tried them on.  The store seemed to go dark and I knew I had something.  The Banyans are sleek and sexy and the protection from the sun is unparalleled.  I fish a lot and that was really what I wanted a good pair for.  I'm terrible with estimated depth in the water but I've think I've seen fish with these glasses on that had to be in 25 feet of water.  Now obviously that was clear water but I've never had such clarity looking down into the water in my life.  The glasses are so good that when I don't have them and I go outside, I immediately go back inside and get my glasses, that's how good they are.  Now lets talk warranty!  Maui Jim's warranty is totally legit and it will only cost you $10 for shipping and handling to get you glasses fixed.  Scratches and normal ware and tare are not covered, but if anything brakes on the frame they will replace it at no cost (except for S&H).  I have had 2 experiences dealing with Maui Jim's directly and they have been nothing short of amazing.  My glasses had snapped at the hinge of one of the arms right in the middle of the summer.  So it was important for me to have my glasses so I decided to glue the piece back together, which I would regret.  The fix held for a couple of months but it got to the point where I could no longer repair them myself.  So I went to Maui Jim's website, filled out a form, printed out my packing slip, boxed up my glasses, and my package was off in the mail.  I can't remember exactly how long it was that I sent my glasses to the time I heard back from them, but it wasn't long at all.  The had inspected my glasses and then called me to inform me of the situation.  So it turns out that because I tried to repair my glasses myself with super glue they were unable to get the screw out to repair my glasses.  To say the least I was devastated.  Then they went above and beyond for me to keep my a happy and loyal customer.  They offered me a discounted pair of glasses and out of respect for what they did for me I'm not going to say how much but lets just say I immediately said yes and had a new pair of glasses on my way.  Every single person that I dealt with at the company was amazing.  I am in sales myself at a very customer service oriented company so I take how a company treats me very seriously.  Out of all the companies I have ever dealt with Maui Jim's is right at the top.  I can only speak for the quality of the Banyan line of sunglasses but if that is any indication how the rest of the line is, BUY THEM.  I hope you found this helpful I know this may sound like a company PR review, but I assure you its not, I am 100% real and have no association with Maui Jim other than being a customer.  Oh and I totally suggest getting some sort of neck strap so you don't loose or drop your glasses!  I prefer the rope type but to each their own!!", "summary": "BUY THEM NOW!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1476489600}

The hook/eye closures are tight and not easy to work with cold, old hands, but you could pry the hook open a little more to make it easier. I was wondering why the manufacturer/care labels were sewn inside the left pocket, until I found a removable hang tag under the arm that says \"REVERSIBLE\". I tried it, and it is, but I like the leopard side out better. I am 5' 100 lbs and the small fits fine. For the price, this is a good faux leopard coat to knock around in.

It fits like a stadium coat, so if you are large in the stomach area you will not have a problem with fit.  The collar is large and when you pull it up it will cover 3/4 of your head.  Closure is a fabric coated hook and eye.  Pockets are roomy.  No where on the coat is there a care label.  There is an attached tag that lists lining and outer material as 100% Polyester.  I am assuming it could be washed gently.  Made in China as is everything now days.  The lining is a nice light weight Poly, making it easy to get arms in and out.  OK, now I will come clean and admit I bought both patterns/colors, and like them both.

This jacket is so light-weight and warm; it's hard to believe.  It is TOASTY no matter how frigid it is outside. I live in New Jersey and have worn this in temps in the upper 20's and low 30's.  I usually wear this jacket with just a long sleeve cotton T-shirt or a quick-dry shirt underneath.  I wear this during my 3-4 mile walks, and after a few minutes, I usually end up unzipping it to cool off.  I have even worn it in single digits, with a sweat-shirt underneath and have been very toasty.  The only negative is the sizing.  I fall in-between the small and medium on the Patagonia size chart.  The small was just a bit tight under my arms, so I ended up getting the medium which fits a bit roomy in the body.  Still, the fit is very flattering.  It has a long, lean look, and comes right to my hips, slightly covering the top of my butt.  I am 5 ft 8 inches, 120 pounds, tall and thin. My measurements are 36B-29-36.  I usually wear a size 4 or 6.  Depending on how you want to layer this, it will dictate your size.

As for sizing, purchase your usual size, or a size up. These kimonos are meant to fit loosely and that's exactly how the medium fit for me. I was unsure of how it would fit based on mixed reviews so I did order a size up, but it's not too baggy and I could have definitely ordered a small (I'm not sure if a small was available at that time, though). I had absolutely no issue with the sleeves or anything being too tight as they were actually as baggy as you would expect from the picture.

These pants are quite beautiful, I wanted them for a dressy party. However, they were far too short for me.\n\nI ordered size large, and the fit was perfect had they been longer. They were at least 2 inches too short, even with no shoes on, and I had planned to wear at least a 3 inch heel. They were of such high quality that I may have considered keeping them for flats had they been 3 inches longer, I would have needed them to be about 5-6 inches longer if I wanted to wear heels. Sadly, I am returning them.\n\nAfter reading the other reviews about material being too heavy I thought I would comment on this to be helpful for other potential buyers. The material is of a heavier weight, which lends to the overall look being very classy and expensive looking so I found this to be a plus had they been long enough for me to keep. This made the pants extremely flattering because the material flowed over any flaws and hid them. If they were longer and sold them in 10 colors, I would have bought all 10, they looked that good.\n\nAlso, as far as the sizing, I chose the size that corresponded to my numerical size and it was perfect, except for the length. Lixmee,, please increase the length of this product! If they are too long for others of smaller height, they can easily have them tailored. For those of us that are a bit taller and wish to wear heels, we are out of luck. If the cost of material is the issue, I would gladly pay a bit more to have the option of an extended length.\n\nFYI - My guess is that these pants would be perfect for women that are 5'4\", or maybe (big maybe)  5'5\"  if they plan to wear flats.", "summary": "Way too short for 5'7\" woman, even with flat shoes!", "unixReviewTime": 1492214400}

Some things about it, first, it is made in India which makes me suspect the origin of the hide used. The hide is what I would call lambskin. It is ultra soft, but not a rugged coat for outdoors. Secondly, the lining is not quilted nor is the jacket insulated to any noticeable degree. Apart from these two VERY minor criticisms, if the coat had been tailored to size, I'd be wearing it right now. It got 4 stars because of size but, it's ORVIS so there is no question of quality.

The carry strap hardware on one side broke after a few uses, on a day when I had the bag packed to about 40 lbs, probably my fault as I shouldn't have packed it this heavy as the hardware tolerance seems less than that.

The bag does seem sturdy; the material is canvas, even the interior.  The zipper is a little hard to zip and may have been sewn a little unevenly (which was more of an annoyance than anything else).  My biggest complaint about the bag and the reason I am returning it (and giving it two stars) is that there is a metal logo attached to one of the front pockets.  It is not attractive, not removable (without damaging the bag), and could easily get caught on something (which would likely cause damage to the bag).  I also did not like that the \"padded\" section of the shoulder strap is curved which forces you to carry the bag with the pockets to the outside, not against your body should you want a little extra \"security\".", "summary": "Would have been better without the logo.", "unixReviewTime": 1488067200}

It's based on Star Trek: The Next Generation's science/medical uniforms (think Counselor Troi or Doctor Crusher), but it's a short dress. My mother actually mistook it for a classic Trek uniform, until I told her it was from ST:TNG. It's a \"skater dress\" (referring to the length and cut of the skirt) and even though they don't mean it literally, I think it would be awesome to see a figure skater wear this on the ice, while skating to one of the themes from the newest Star Trek film! Personally, I bought it to wear to DragonCon, the massive sci-fi/fantasy convention held in Atlanta every summer.\n\nBe aware that the sizing is juniors, so if you're used to wearing women's sizes, don't order your regular size or it will be too small! Go up at least one size, if not two. I typically wear a small or medium in women's, while in juniors I'm usually a large. All the reviews said it was very small, so just to be safe, I ordered an extra-large, which fits comfortably. If I went down a size, it would still fit, but would be rather snug. It's also rather short. One reviewer said it barely covered her rear, but mine isn't quite that short! I was hoping it *would* be, so I could wear it with jeans, like a long t-shirt. It comes to about mid-thigh on me, which might look a bit strange with jeans, but it's too short to wear on its own. (I'm not that brave, even at DragonCon!) However, it should look adorable with black leggings, or black pants, which is my plan.\n\nThe communicator and commander's pips are printed on, which means they might eventually start to peel or crack. I assume that's the reason why this dress is air-dry only---you're not supposed to put it in the dryer. If you think it looks too cheesy, you could probably pin real pips and a communicator badge over the printed ones. That's what I wanted to do, but I didn't have time to order them before DragonCon. Maybe next year!\n\nOverall, I'm extremely happy with this purchase. It was a bit on the expensive side when I ordered, but it's so cute! The low neck and cap sleeves give it a modern twist, while making it more bearable to wear in warmer venues, like DragonCon in Atlanta, or ComicCon in Phoenix or San Diego. The fabric is stretchy, which helps accommodate different sizes and shapes. It's absolutely perfect for fans of Star Trek. I'll give it five stars and recommend it for anyone who wants a unique, quirky way to play dress-up for any science-fiction event. Or, it's comfortable enough to wear as a nightgown, if you wanted.\n\nP.S. If blue isn't your color, it also comes in red (command), or gold (security/engineering).

I'm used to caftan sleeves reaching to just above the elbow.  Contrary to what was said about it needing to be hand washed and not to put in the dryer, I was told by another purchaser that she did wash and dry in the machines.  First, though, I colorfast it, having done that with previous batik  caftans. Then, I washed it in my machine, used a fabric softener in the wash rinse and then dried in my dryer on low and it was wearable straight out of the dryer.\n  To naturally colorfast the fabric, in one gallon of fresh, clean, cold water, add 1/4 cup table salt and one cup white vinegar, give the water a swish to make sure the salt and vinegar are evenly distributed.  Add the caftan and press it into the water until it's fully saturated. That's it! Let the fabric soak in the water for 24 hours to ensure the color is completely set. You might notice a bit of color in the water, but that's OK. Remove the item, dump the water and rinse the container, and fill it with fresh water. Add the fabric back to the container and gently squish and swirl it, refreshing it with clean water. If you still see color releasing from the fabric, repeat a soaking in the vinegar saltwater. Let the fabric fully dry, and your item will hold its color the next time it's tossed in the wash. Immediately after I colorfast the garment in that solution, I put it in a cold rinse cycle of my machine with Downy Liquid Fabric Softener and then dried in my dryer for 20-30 mins. then took it straight out of the dryer and hung it up till I was ready to wear it.

If this one lasts as long as the other I'm sure it will be a great wallet for years to come.\n\nUpdate: I have been using this wallet every day for nearly 2 years, and I am still very impressed. There is a little bit of wear and tear here and there but overall if has held up extreemly well. A bit of color has come off the outside but this wallet still functions great.", "summary": "I am very pleased with this new version", "unixReviewTime": 1461110400}

I contacted the seller and they was very eager to resolve the issue. They are sending me the belt so, I'm pleased with that. Especially since it was resolved in 24hrs.\nNow to the sweater. It's a great sweater I must say. It's thick and despite the comments saying cheaply made I beg to differ. Everything seems very well put together. And mine had no smell what so ever. I wore it the very next day without washing it. The length is what I expected considering they gave measurements in the description. I knew what to expect. The sleeves as well are just as the stated. I'm 5'5, 129lbs with a bust size 36 (bra size 32D) and it's a tad snug in the bust area. The length hits just above the bottom of my butt. The sleeves are right at the wrist but can be stretched a bit. Overall I think it's a really nice sweater. I was going to give it 4 stars because of the lack of a belt but they handled the issue so well that I decided to give it a 5 anyways.

After looking at the size chart, I decided to buy the size 2 dress with one-day shipping. I was not disappointed.\n\nThe dress arrived the day before the event. I was actually shocked at how small the packaging was since the dress was rather \"fluffy\". I took the dress out and not a sequin was out of place. It really was love at first sight.\n\nI'm 5'8 and a 34b in victoria secret. I ended up wearing sandals with the dress because heels are so uncomfortable to dance in. The dress covered them up - slightly meaning I did need to pull up the dress a little while walking downtown as to not get the bottom of the dress dirty, but could let it flow freely while inside the event without worrying about tripping over myself. In all honesty it was a perfect fit. There wasn't a need to wear a strapless bra because the sequin top works perfectly as one. I also did not have to worry about the dress sliding down. It even remained up during the various dances my significant other and I did.\n\nA+ purchase.\n\nNote on images - I was standing lopsided.

Okay, so first off I LOVE THIS dress. It comes in the exact color as seen (I got the light teal). In addition, you can send them the measurements to get it fit just right to your body. The dress will fall how it should provided you give them your measurement. The company is SO helpful and willing to work with you. They even offer refund options (I will not be needing to do this). In addition, the shipment was extremely fast. The predicted date of delivery was the 28th of September and I got it on the 11th.\n\nI love the measurement options because I am a Plus Sized Woman and it is so hard to get something to ever fit my body right. With that being said there were a few hiccups so here they are and here are some tips and recommendations to the seller:\n\n1. Dress was to long. I am only 5'6\" and the hallow to floor measurement is not accurate. The dress is even to long with 4\" heels on. Make sure when sending length measurements that you emphases your height and the hallow measurement. Luckily my mom can sew and is willing to help me hem it.\n2. Dresses waist was an 1 1/2\" to big for me and will need to be taken in. This was my fault. I measured my waist and ordered it an inch smaller for predicted weight loss. I lost more than I should have.\n3.

Ace bandages just weren't doing it for me anymore, and I really needed a chest binder for cosplay, and this was the cheapest alternative I could find since I couldn't afford an Underworks binder. My friends, if your chest is bigger than 36 inches, don't buy this. I'm a 38D and ordered the biggest size they had (which many said would still fit). I could get the clasps closed, but after only two hours of wear, I was in so much pain I could barely breathe. The next day was even worse.

The estimated delivery date was from June 30th to July 21st. It was delivered to my door June 8, 2016 coming all the way from Mumbai (via DHL). You can't get much better than that! The color of the top isn't the orange-yellow \"mustard\" color described/shown in the picture, it is better......a bright sunny yellow, which I love! I ordered size Medium, which is what I received. It is a little snug in the mid-section, but that is not the manufacturers fault; it is mine due to my ice cream addiction! (I am on a diet having lost 10 Lbs so far & expect to lose 5 to 10 more) I bought the top to wear to my daughter's combination college graduation & 50th birthday party in July this year, so it should fit perfectly by then. I plan on wearing it with black leggings, but would go well with leggings of other colors as well. It is a thin, knit, 97% viscous / 3% lycra, T-shirt like material, and is very soft, but also has a front lining in the bust area which is a plus. It appears to be well made. Cleaning instructions state first time dry clean, then hand wash separately in cold water, and dry flat, but I see no reason for that if machine washed in cold water on the gentle cycle with like colors and materials using a gentle detergent, and dried on air dry cycle of dryer and promptly removed. The manufacturer also enclosed a necklace as a free gift for ordering from them!\nI would highly recommend this product to every woman, and I plan on purchasing from them again.", "summary": "I LOVE THIS TOP!!", "unixReviewTime": 1465430400}

The reviews seem all over the spectrum but the price seemed worth the risk. It arrived promptly and I tried to ignore the packaging which made it look like I'd just ordered a parachute. I sliped the dress on and felt circus-like (NOT GOOD). It \"fits\" but...OH MY. The elastic waist is sewn tightly meaning that if you have the slightest curves from your waist down, the fabric looks more like clown pants. If you have a very small butt and narrow hips you'd probably get away with this (If you *actually* look good in skinny jeans, this skirt is for you). Sadly that wasn't the only issue. It is MEGA long. Not just a few inches...MEGA. While wearing it, the skirt was like a puddle on the floor around me (I'm 5ft 9\" so this is very unusual). I took the skirt off, held the hem of the skirt to just below my ankles and then saw how high the waistline was. It was awkwardly at the part of my chest where you measure your bra cup size. Yeah. Dissappointed. I could tailor it to fit but then I'm doing the work to make it from a 2-star skirt to a 5-star skirt.\nRight now this skirt just feels like a tribute to a Circus: Big-top style fabric, clown-pants like hem, and have to walk on stilts to wear it as a skirt!!", "summary": "Elastic waist is sewn too tight and skirt is WAY too long", "unixReviewTime": 1437091200}

I just toss them out. I always wear the white ones with an under tank top, as they are a bit see through, but I always wear under tanks anyway so that is not an issue for me. The black and navy are fine to wear alone with a smooth t-shirt bra. The shirts are clingy but that's my look so if you have bulges to hide, go with something else.

I am not a big person by any means, a little busty perhaps, but not a large person. I look like a tube of sausage in this dress. The fabric isn't anywhere near stretchy enough, and it's very sheer in between the scales. It's your basic halloween costume material that traps heat and sweat and isn't very comfortable. A terrible fabric for a form fitting dress. But I think the worst thing about this dress, hands down, is the way it was sloppily sewn together. There are holes along every seam of this thing, like the machine would just skip a few stitches. The edges aren't hemmed, and there are long threads hanging down in places.

My fiance had a few things (some good, and quite a few things needing work) to say in regards to trying this jacket out. ((He likes the simplicity of pros and cons list so that is why the review is in that format)). These are the things he told me he had to say about this:\n\nPros:\n-style is retro but cool\n-He was told Denim is starting to come back in style\n-removable hood is awesome!\n-Length on his torso is just right, (not to long and not too short)\n-Color of dark denim looks good on my fiance (he's so handsome)\n\nCons:\n- a bit tight for the sizing (we chose a much bigger size based off the reviews of others prior to us)..\n-sleeves too short by about 2\"\n-shape is a bit boxy and thus unflattering (in the torso area)\n-no pockets on the sides for hands\n-button size too big for holes (make the holes a bit bigger so next time closing and taking off coat won't be so difficult)\n\nAll and all, my fiance likes the coat but it needs some serious work to make it really worth the cost, and make it more comfortable to wear. These are all suggestions and our hope is the company will use them to better their product. Not sure if we'd recommend them to friends and family based off the issues we had with it, but he'll wear it. I just don't feel it's worth the money at this point.

When it arrived it fit perfectly. The sizing from the US to China are a bit different but again if you follow the sellers instructions you should be just fine. I was worried about the sleeves being a little thin (we live in the south and it gets a little cold here) but they are very warm. The vest part is jean, again not thin at all, the weight of the jacket is what I call in between. It's not so heavy that it's a coat but not so thin that it won't keep you warm in the fall (again, i'm in the south). I have had to wash it a few times since receiving it and it has not shrunk and that's with just washing it and throwing it into the dryer. The only downside to this jacket is the fact that it does not have pockets which my son doesn't mind at all. I myself and my son highly recommend this jacket.

When I received it, it was perfect and only the original box had been substituted, so I was quite pleased.\n\nI tried it on and it fit well. No problems there.  I noticed that it seemed uncomfortable, however, and rubbed between my fingers due to the Cubic Zirconias being set all around the band.  As I wore it around the house, I found that they didn't sparkle like I had expected either.  They are pretty little stones and appear to be set very well, but I just didn't see them catch the light and sparkle like I'd expected they would.  I ended up deciding to return it, mostly due to the discomfort, but also due to the fact that it didn't impress me enough to put up with it.\n\nI have a number of Myia Passiello jewelry pieces and have always been happy with their quality and design.  This ring looked sturdy and was made well too.  Perhaps the different colored rings in this design are more impressive but this \"clear on silver\" just didn't bring the bling that the price would mandate for me, and I only paid about a third of the retail price.\n\nEdit- 7-17- I have taken a chance and purchased this ring in other colors since writing this review and added a star. I have the black, blue, and the turquoise rings and like them a lot. They are much more attractive, colorful, and sparkly than the clear ring, to me, and I've been able to wear them without a lot of discomfort. Of course, this style ring will tend to catch on things a little more than a smooth ring, but not terribly. I suggest you give them a try if you're attracted to the look and style. Myia Passiello has been a reliable, well-made brand for me and I've purchased a lot of pieces. The Swarovski zirconias have always been clear and beautiful, as these are. None of the rings have lost stones yet either! Yay!\n\nThe price fluctuates a LOT on these rings so keep tabs to get the best, if you have time. I'd actually give these four and a half stars now.\n\n6-17-18-- Just wanted to add that I've never lost a stone in Myia Passiello jewelry, and I have quite a lot of pieces, including earrings, necklaces, and rings. They are made well and keep their looks with a bit of common sense and care.

You could pull it around your face for more warmth, or just pull it to the top of your head for a cute (less-conehead-like) look. As another reviewer mentioned, one side of the scarf is longer than the other. It's meant to wrap around your neck (like a scarf) and then both sides are about the same. So if you didn't want to wear this as a scarf, you might look into another option as having one really long side would look weird and wouldn't function as a mitten (unless you had one really long arm).

The hood is not centered on the strip that goes around as a scarf.  From the edge of the hood, one \"arm\" is 20 inches long, while the other \"arm\" is about 4 1/2 feet long.  Therefore, the scarf looks very odd unless you have it wrapped around your neck.\n\nOnce wrapped, the hand-warmers are pretty \"short\" on me; I'm 5'8\", and they hit mid-boob.  As far as walking normally with my hands in the warmers, it's a no-go.  As far as putting my hands in the warmers while I've got my elbows bent/held close to my sides, works great.\n\nThe material is super fleecy.  It shed quite a bit coming out of the package, and like many fleece items, it also picks up a lot of lint.  Also like the best fleece materials, this is super soft and super warm. Feels good to the touch.\n\nOverall,  I'm super pleased with this purchase, especially at the price sold.  I think I've made a good investment.  While not using the handwarmers, and with the scarf wrapped around your neck, the garment looks great/feminine.  It's awesome to have the handwarmers built in, so I won't lose them as easily as I do my gloves.\n\nI would recommend the purchase.

I was surprised at how much there was. Removing the lint really improved the look.  Unfortunately, there isn't any stretch or give to this fabric... it's pretty stiff material.\n\nLooking at the stitching on the seams. I easily found two spots on one arm where the stitching was not properly secured to the seam. After only three wearings, one of the two spots came undone. I now have a hole that two fingers can pass through, a couple inches up from the wrist cuff, on the forearm seam. Yes it's something I can easily fix. For what I paid, I shouldn't need to though.  I'm pretty dissatisfied!\n\n  If you are a physically fit guy, that is well built, this sweater will likely be too tight along the biceps.  Possibly the forearms too.\n\nOverall, I think this was a so-so purchase.

I especially love wearing rings, and I wear them all the time. I have a ring on every finger. So does my daughter. That is why, when I had the chance to review the daughter's ring by TZARO, I jumped at the chance. This is a ring that she will wear forever.  The ring looks exactly like it shows in the picture.  The engraving is just as it appears in the picture. I ordered a size 6 ring, expecting it to be a little loose. Thankfully, it fits perfectly. In fact it fits better than her graduation ring does. I am going to save it until she finishes college. She graduates in May.  The only reason that I have the ring, on my finger, is to review it. I don't want to take it off! I definitely am going to buy another one for someone I consider my mother. This ring is made of a sturdy metal that is silver plated, so it will not turn your finger green. It is hard enough to withstand dings and dents without ruining the ring. I love the hamsa pattern that is on the front of the ring. To me, it symbolizes my love for my daughter,, even though there are bumps in the road. TZARO Company has other rings for your family members. I also bought one for my two sisters. I cannot wait when I give the rings to them to see what their faces look like. I know the two of them will be extremely surprised and happy to receive them.\n\nI received this product at a discount to allow me to test it, and then write a review based on the results of my experience using this product.

I would recommend this item to any Hello Kitty fan than needs a wallet.", "summary": "My Hello Kitty wallet", "unixReviewTime": 1451779200}

The jacket came pretty much as shown, with some minor differences in the shape of the scorpion patch's tail and pincers and some two-toned coloring in it's stitching in what appears to be an attempt to give it some shadowing depth. Also, to my dismay, the collar is angled instead of rounded like in the photo, which adds a little too much heft to the collar for my taste.\n\nThe fitting seems pretty good. I'm a little under 6ft and weigh about 145lbs and ordered a small, I'm a thin guy and prefer a snug fit. The maneuverability is pretty good, but the sleeves are a bit short for me and the jacket pulls up exposing some midriff when I raise my hands over my head.\n\nThe jacket itself has a padded insulation and feels a bit poofy, but is comfortable once you get used to it. The padding doesn't appear to make it look poofy, but it does cause it to feel very warm. This jacket seems suitable enough to keep me warm all winter without a problem (I live in Southern Arizona), but I haven't fully tested it out in the cold yet. There are four pockets (two outside and two inside) big enough to fit a wallet or cellphone in.\n\nOne of the down sides to this jacket was that it seemed to be covered in some sort of oily substance when I received it and had a pretty bad chemical smell, like fresh dye possibly. I had to wash it three times before the smell was bearable. It recommends to get it dry cleaned, but I machine washed it on a gentle setting and it seems to be holding up just fine.\n\nOverall a good buy for the price. I think it'd get the job done for a really good looking cosplay, and more importantly, makes for a totally radical jacket to rock for a night out on the town!", "summary": "Scorpion Jacket!!", "unixReviewTime": 1461456000}

I didn't want a dumpy potato sack cheap fitting t-shirt and was looking for a shirt with an athletic fit or tapered fit and snug fitting around the arms. Reading the bullet point descriptions on several they sounded like just what I was looking for. I ordered three different designs but the problem was that they arrived printed on three different manufacturers t-shirts of varying quality, fit and construction.\n\nThe three designs I ordered were all size XL:\n\nEagle Service\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/Mens-Service-Graphic-Athletic-T-Shirt-Size-X-Large-by-Ajaxx63/dp/B005SYP4YK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Mens Service Graphic Athletic T-Shirt Size X-Large by Ajaxx63</a>\nIf all three tshirts had been printed on this brand of shirt, Id already be ordering others and paying extra for overnight shipping. Just feels like a high quality shirt. Roomy in the chest with a slight taper to the waist. Nice quality heavily ribbed neck and arm bands are comfortable and snug up lightly to my very average biceps; not tight at all yet miles away from flapping in the breeze like a cheap tshirt.

Nice fitting with a taper cut and the arms aren't flapping in the breeze. T-shirt material seems a little thinner than the shirt described above. The neck and arm bands are pretty average. I really like the picture so I hope this shirt stands up to repeated washings.

It is literally a HANES tagless t-shirt. Ill wash it and see if the fit improves but its got wide arms and is long enough to wear as a mini-dress (too bad I don't do drag). It feels and fits more like a t-shirt that your grandparents picked up in an airport souvenir shop on their way back from their vacation in Boca.

I found one that I liked and ordered it and while doing so I saw this Men's Wrap Around Black Frame Lifestyle Dark Lense Sunglasses by Sunglass Stop Shop.  They freaking looked identical in the picture but this one was 10 times cheaper so I ordered it too not really knowing what to expect.  I received it one day early and I really liked that and when I opened it I was amazed!  It looked exactly the same in person!  It seems like they were made in the same mold or something!\n\nI ordered black polarized lenses to replace the dark bronze lenses the brand name one came with, so that added to the cost.  I thought I could swap lenses and putting the brand name lenses on the cheap one but I compared the lenses and noticed they're very slightly differently shaped, so no matter how much I tried, it just didn't fit.  Well maybe if I sand it down or something, it could fit but I don't want to do that.  Besides not being able to swap lenses, everything else is amazing.  Both are matte black, the frame feels pretty sturdy, the cheap one was lighter though, I feel a slight difference in material, the cheap one feels more plastic and the brand name feels like a blended plastic, the lenses are pretty decent although I wanted polarized lenses but maybe they'll have a polarized version later.\n\nI showed my wife the sunglasses side by side and asked her which one is the real one and her first response was \"what do you mean which one is the real one\".  She couldn't tell at first glance.  The replacement lenses made the brand name one stand out but I know if the replacement lenses were able to fit in this cheap one, I know she probably could have never tell.  She kinda got mad at me for buying the expensive one lol.  Anyways, I'm very happy with this purchase and if it ever broke I would buy another one in a heart beat.  I saw other sunglasses these seller is selling with similar styles as brand name ones and I would probably get the cheap one than get the expensive one.  I just want nice looking sunglasses that protect my eyes from UV, sure it may not be polarized, but these cheap glasses does a good enough job for 10 times the price cheaper.  I only have one brand name sunglasses and I've owned a few cheap sunglasses but this by far are the best cheap sunglasses I ever bought!  I attached a picture to compare the expensive one and the cheap one and I realized I would rather buy 10 cheap ones than one at 10 times the cost.", "summary": "the best cheap sunglasses I ever bought!", "unixReviewTime": 1423699200}

You sell the most unique, high quality scarves and pashminas. They always come wrapped like little presents with a thank you note, which makes me feel  better about my shameless scarf addiction.  ;) . This particular scarf is such a rich explosion of color - I am madly in love with it! It's Tribal and artsy, and the quality of the weave is high. The dimensions are a bit unusual for the typical scarf (it's a bit narrower), but that actually makes it more versatile - not so much fabric width to deal with what you want to knot it creatively. This will go equally well with basic black or jeans and my crazy purple suede boots!", "summary": "Keep 'em coming, Bohomonde!", "unixReviewTime": 1487894400}

I believe a nice scarf can completely dress up an outfit and make it look more stylish. I also live in New England and half the year you need a nice scarf so your neck doesn't freeze or get eaten by mosquito's and no see um bugs!\n\nI purchased this pashmina scarf because it has many of the colors that I wear every day in it. It looked very beautiful and I felt it would be a perfect scarf to take on vacation because it has so many options.\n\nThe second time I wore the scarf I had a disaster with a jar of minced garlic. I immediately put the scarf into the washing machine on the gentle cycle by itself.\n\nAfter washing the scarf came out with a tighter knit and it had some pills and loose threads. It's not noticeable from far away but you can see it up close and it does make the scarf look well loved. I wish it had washed up nicer and still looked brand new. I was happy none of the colors faded at all.\n\nI was given the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted price of $2 for my honest and unbiased review.

The colors are so bright and vibrant and the texture adds so much depth. It is really hard to do this scarf justice with a picture! You can see the colors great, but it is hard to see the texture.

I am a huge fan of the clutch wallets, but have found that a lot of them don't have the space that I need to put all my cards. This is not the case with this purchase. The wallet has a lot of room, and as an added bonus in the zippered portion, it has another zippered compartment for change. This is awesome for me because all the other zippered portions in past wallets have has small gas where my change fell out, so this adds extra security. The colors are true to the picture, and it seems very sturdy, however the button that closes the main portion of the wallet is difficult to open. The only reason this worries me is because I don't want to pull too hard and rip out the clasp.

The other reason is the clasp is hard for her to do on her own (and she likes to do everything on her own), making it harder for her to get on and off when she wants. It's easy to wash and keep clean though and overall a great product. My recommendation would be to make it a bit longer in order to slide over a child's head without using the clasp.

This shipping was awesome. The goldtone is nice and even. It is not too heavy nor is it so light that it feels plastic or cheap.

Often it will catch and the necklace will not lay flat, two or more sections of the necklace will lean up against the next section and not lay flat or smooth against your neck. So it can be uncomfortable to wear. I don't think I would have purchased this had I known this, but since I have it I will wear it when I need this particular color. I won't be often though. So I am not whole heartedly giving my recommendation for this necklace but it will do in a pinch if you need this color. I posted some photos. The first it how it will stand up and lean on another section. The second photo is of the back and the links. The third is of the necklace and how it looks when it lays flat.

Against a black or white blouse, this is a striking piece.  The picture does not do it justice.\n\nI and extremely sensitive to metals and most costume jewelry but I was curious about this piece.  The low cost made it seem like a low risk purchase, so I went ahead and ordered. Glad I did!  I was happy to find that this does not irritate me after wearing a portion of the day.  The necklace also does not cause discolorations.  I can't speak about the earrings if wearing them all day.  My ears are SUPER sensitive, so I don't chance it.  I have only worn them for an hour and take them off. What I can say about the earrings, is that they did not cause the 'tingle' I usually feel with other costume jewelry.\n\nAs an alternative, I usually pair the necklace with real 14K gold earrings and sterling silver.  The gold is a nice tone that is probably closer to 10K gold than 14K, but it is still nice.  It is heavy enough to be durable, but light enough to not notice it all day.\n\nIt goes well to dress up a t-shirt and jeans and my semi-formal wear/business attire.\n\nMy advice; get the mesh bracelet to complete the look.", "summary": "Flexible Piece- Get the Bracelet to Complete the Look", "unixReviewTime": 1452816000}

I wanted the rock n roll look of red lining so I sent the jacket back (it, too, zipped on the left, but fit well).  When I received the replacement, it zipped on the left, had a red lining, but no leather zipper pulls.  I contacted the seller and asked if they could send me the pulls.  I offered to pay.  They said they would try but that they had no control over the making of the jackets! Then they said if I wrote a positive review they would send leather pulls.  After several emails I sit here with no zipper pulls and a jacket that zips on the left, a women's jacket.", "summary": "Buyer Beware", "unixReviewTime": 1465776000}

I would recommend this coat to small framed people, it really is a beautiful coat, fairly well made.

I'd say that if you're any bigger then these measurements it's probably a good idea to not purchase this item as I picked the XXL which is the largest size available and it's still rather snug. The jacket fits very nicely other then the arms that are a bit tight but they're far from cutting off circulation and the top clasp doesn't seem to want to hold my breasts in the coat. I can see it struggling to hold the fabric over them and this was also without a bra on. I'd say it will probably look alright though if I just leave the top clasp undone or if I wear this with a sports bra. The coat feels rather heavy and like it'll keep me pretty toasty when the cold months start rolling around. It does have a rather funky smell but I'm banking that it'll wear off or at least wear thin with some use. Also the interior of the jacket is white. I had this coat saved on another web site and kept reading that the interior was coming in black on reviews but I did a bit of looking around and it looks like I made the right choice as mine is exactly how it's shown in the picture. In case you were wondering, the material of the interior is the silky, opaque, stuff that's used in wind breakers. It still looks nice but I was hoping for something a bit thicker however I'm just so pleased it came in the color I wanted I barely even care. Over all, I'd say this jacket is very nice as long as you do some homework on it.", "summary": "Take extra care ordering.", "unixReviewTime": 1440460800}

So the Brown Color is a Dark Rich Brown, the Color shown is more of a Tawny/Reddish Brown. *it's weird, if you look at MY photo(s). The Color when it's a Tawny/Reddish Brown, is when taken near Light Bulb Light, the last photo of my 3, where it looks darker was taken in Florescent Light (either way they're an attractive brown). I hope I didn't just make things more confusing. Okay. So I have a sort-of skinny foot, if I had fat chubby feet I'd say they may be too tight at the actually foot part. I also do not have chubby calves, and there is an adequate amount of extra room there as well. They are pretty comfortable, but by hour 8-10 they do start to ache, my feet/legs that is. I own many of these boots in a variety of colors. The first thing I do before I wear them outside is buy a quality suede water-repellent and spray them generously, and even once a month or every other month, especially at the foot part. I live where it's Snowy/Rainy. I've had my oldest pairs for 4.5yrs now and the Suede still looks really good, although mind you I do baby my footwear. *Also I did have to adjust the Belt at the Crown of the Foot and at the Top of the Boot, but like I said, I have skinnier feet/calves. AND... **A HOLE is NOT there to adjust to make them Tighter either, so I had to take them to a Shoe Guy and Have him punch me a new hole, that's really the only draw back.", "summary": "Love these Boots.............", "unixReviewTime": 1449100800}

It is fairly long and will look great with leggings and boots. Now if you tend to be more of an apple shape, thicker through the waist, this probably isn't the best style for you.

I was never looking for the huge sloppy look, I wanted a close fit that could be tucked in to jeans or worn with a tank top or t-shirt, but somewhat fitted.\nI ended up ordering the XXL and it is slightly larger, but not as fitted, but still cute.\nShipping time was much better this time.\nStill haven't washed so can't comment, might not wash, case I like the crisp look, so might just dry clean.\nIf I wash the XXL will let you know how that goes.", "summary": "Small,  but Nice Quality and Cute", "unixReviewTime": 1418688000}

The design has lasted through almost a year of washing it once a week and, though faded, you can still see what it is. The design seems to be almost dyed into the fabric instead of being a plastic-type graphic that is put on with heat, which means the design has faded, not cracked or fallen off. I really liked this as my daughter wears this shirt at least once a week and it would break her heart if the design had peeled off like some of her other shirts.\nThis product was very well made.
