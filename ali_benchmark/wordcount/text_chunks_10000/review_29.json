I ordered both a Medium and the Large, and the Medium was a better fit. I am 5' 8 1/2 tall, weigh 148 lbs (174 cm, 66 kg),very  curvy build with small waist. I normally wear a 34D bra and size 8 clothes. The top was short in both the Medium and the Large, but the Size M made \"the girls\" look perkier, whereas is the Size L top just kind of hung there and did not lay flat. In both sizes the skirt fit almost the same - its stretchy but the medium accentuated my smaller waist and curvy hips more. (About what to wear underneath, if anything: I did not like the too-bare look of the white fabric on me, so I did a skin-tone Vic Sec bra under the Medium top, and skintone sheer boy shorts under the skirt.{ I will order the Black next, so that one will probably have more coverage and not require so much thought to what to wear under the outfit.}\n\nFIT/SHAPE SUGGESTIONS:  This outfit looks best on curvy, hourglass or pear shape figures. You need a little bit of hips to make it look anything like the model's picture. The top is very short, so be prepared to show some skin if you're taller than 5'4\" or more.\n\nSIZE SUGGESTIONS:\nStretchy fabric means the outfit could fit a range of sizes.\n- MEDIUM: Could Fit sizes 6 ,8, or 10 if small waists,  Fits about Bra Sizes B, C, or D cup.\n-  LARGE:  Fits sizes 8, 10, 12 or maybe a 14 with no muffin top. Fits Bra Sizes up to 36 C,D, DD  or 34 DDD\n\nTHIS OUTFIT IS PERFECT FOR:  It's sexy but casual. Works great for Summer Events, \"White Parties\", Pool Parties, Nightclubs", "summary": "SEXY, SPORTY, STUNNING - but sheer in the white", "unixReviewTime": 1499126400}

I'm 5'7\", 135lbs, 34b with hips and a booty and the small fit really well. It was a bit tight when I first put it on but loosened after walking around in it. I'm nervous the material will continue to stretch out when I'm wearing it and it will lose its shape. I think it will shrink a lot if you put it in the dryer, I would suggest hang dry. I'm just not sure how long it will hold up b/c the material isn't great however since it's so cheap if I can get a couple wears out of it before it falls apart I'm ok with it. The top fits me perfect but I'm also small chested, not sure how anyone over a C cup would get much more coverage than how an actual sports bra would fit. Also as you can see from my picture the blue is NOT bright electric blue like the product picture, it's more like a royal blue which is so much prettier.

It shows just the right amount of stomach area, as I have had 4 children and I have a couple of stretch marks, but even wit this outft I was able to cover that right on up. You can pull the skirt up or down to adjust, and it stil will look right. Also the color was a bit off, the red has a orange-ish tint to it.

Very soft and comfortable material, without also being hot. the skirt is a midi length. On an average person, it would come right below the knees, For me it stopped right before the knees, which is what I was going for, and it also it high waist. Now onto the fitting top. Unfortunately with me being so tall and a little plump on top, the bralette, fit my like a walmart sports bra. It cuffed right under my breast, which was not flattering at all. I'm guessing the models this was based for are a bit shorter than I. I just ended up pairing it with a solid color, dressier tank top and tucking it in.

Whether he decides to go to college or in to the military, I like knowing that his identity will be safe while he is away from home. This wallet comes in an attractive gift box and looks very high end and expensive without the hefty price tag. There is plenty of slots for all of his various cards with room for more.  This wallet is just the right size for a young man starting out on his own for the first time.\n\nHaving worked in an economic crimes and fraud unit for a number of years, I can't stress how important it is to protect your identity. Having this RFID case makes it significantly harder for anyone to steal your information, short of actually stealing the card case. This is such a simple and inexpensive way to protect your identity, because you do not want to deal with the aftermath if your identity is ever stolen. Save yourself a huge headache and protect your cards!\n\nI received this product for free or at a discount for the purposes of review, but this has not affected my review in any way.

Also, I was always paranoid that some thief would either lift my credit card info while I was at a hockey game (its happened to people I know, and I attend a lot of hockey games) or that my credit cards would someway manage to fall out of my old wallet.  So because of this, I decided to purchase this RFID blocking leather wallet from Protectif. The wallet arrived by the estimated delivery date, and was packaged inside of a sleek looking black box adorned with the Protectif logo. The wallet is a classic leather bi-fold style design with the Protectif logo embossed on the bottom right corner. The wallet has a license flap (which can hold credit cars on both sides of the flap as well as underneath it) along with a 2 part divided section for your cash. I like that the cash section of the wallet is divided, as I find this very useful for separating money to put toward certain purchases. When you open up the wallet you're greeted with a classy embossed Protectif logo. Directly above the logo are a few tight slots to store a few credit/business cards securely.\n\nWhen your fold or bend the wallet you can sort of feel and hear that there is certainly some kind of material under the leather (I am assuming that it is the RFID blocking material) lining the outside of the wallet. In this technologically advanced day and age, having the added piece of mind  and protection that this wallet delivers is most definitely worth the money to me.\n\nMy Final Verdict : In general, this RFID blocking leather bi-fold style wallet from Protectif does everything that I need a wallet to do for me. The wallet holds all of my credit cards and cash securely while hopefully blocking RFID signals from thieves. The wallet feels pretty well made at an exceptionally reasonable price. I would recommend this Protectif wallet to anyone looking for a leather bi-fold wallet with RFID blocking technology.\n\nPlease note : I have not yet tested the wallet to see if it actually does indeed block RFID signals as its intended to I just had to throw that out there. Im taking the other reviewers word that the wallet actually does block RFID signals.\n\n**Disclaimer: I received this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, but my thoughts are completely genuine and 100% my own. I have personally used this product and tried my best to reflect my experience with the product so you can make a more informed purchasing decision.**", "summary": "Cool RFID blocking bi-fold wallet", "unixReviewTime": 1465516800}

Well, aside from that feature, this wallet is a very well-made one.  The genuine leather material for which this is made of is of fine quality and I could tell its tough and durable.

Once out of the bag, box and tissue paper, revealed is a really mice brown leather wallet that is not the softest or smoothest of leather, however it is perfectly manufactured.  I'm very picky about seams and stitching, so it was an enormous relief to see that everything was straight, stitched evenly and finished without a flaw.  Having a number of slots for cards, a flap which separates and protects both sides of the wallet, and a slot for monetary bills, you can feel the liner which gives an additional somewhat stiff texture to the wallet.  The color brown is appealing and the Protectif logo is embedded at the lower right corner of the wallet's exterior.

The stated technical purpose of this wallet is to thwart identity and credit card thieves from using RFID scanners to read vital personal information from new credit cards that contain the RFID chip.  Attached are pictures to reference my notes and review of this wallet.\n\nI received this wallet in a very nice presentation box.  There are no markings of country of manufacture anywhere on the box, and the only printing anywhere on the wallet is the stamped name, \"Protectif\" both on the outside and inside lower corner.  Overall impressions right from the start are that of a high quality leather wallet that will last many years.  Protectif technology against reading RFID chips is buried somewhere in the wallet, and not visible or destroying the outside visible appeal.  RFID blockers use something called Faraday technology that essentially foil the ability of electronic readers to affect or even see what's on the other side.  Getting this into a wallet will increase the cost of the wallet, but compared to what losing your credit card information can do, it's not much.\n\nOpening the box, one of the first things you notice is the great smell of leather.  Single stitching is found around the perimeter and well matched with the color of the wallet.  Stitching is further bolstered in corners where the greatest potential for wear and abuse occur.  Inside the wallet, there is room for up to 8 credit cards, though I suspect that with some effort, at least a few of the slots could manage to hold more than one.\n\nOn the left side is a fold over flap with a window pocket in it designed for driver's license or ID.  Fold it out to present it to a clerk, then back in and again and close the wallet when you're done.\n\nThe inside of the back of the wallet where the bills go is lined with a vinyl fabric and it has a bill separator to allow you to keep large denominations separate from smaller ones or as I do it, to keep receipts that I need separate from bills.\n\nI typically look for cons for every product or at least things that I think some people may not care for.  I can't find anything that even picky people wouldn't care for.  Overall, I would highly recommend the product and as a man, suggest that it's one of those gifts that you're pretty safe on for most of us.  Even if we have one that's relatively new, it is still something that we know we will eventually need.  And with the RFID protection, there are probably few people that already have one in their pocket.\n\nI received a free coupon for a complimentary sample provided so that I could test and evaluate the product.  However, I was not asked nor do I offer to write reviews that do not reflect my opinion and I don't recommend products that I would not buy. This is not a barter arrangement. I have no financial or personal connection with anyone selling this product or their employees.", "summary": "Premium leather wallet with built in RFID theft protection", "unixReviewTime": 1442448000}

The bottom seam of the main bill compartment just tore all across. This wallet is reinforced at that natural stress point so I wouldn't expect a similar tear.\n\nA problem with the RFID shielding of course is it doesn't just shield credit cards. I use an ID card swipe throughout my workplace at least 7-8 times a day - often more if I'm using a particular lab. Without having to open my old wallet I could gently pat it against the reader with the ID in any inner pocket and it would be read.\n\nI have to open this wallet for the ID to be read. It's possible to place the ID in the clear flap pocket and wrap it around inside the main bill compartment, or worse, just place the ID in the bill compartment. But neither is optimal: the ID sticks out and it makes inserting/removing money awkward. Either way I feel I'm more likely to lose the ID.\n\nBut other than that, it's an attractive, comfortable wallet, with adequate pockets and I'll probably just get use to flipping it open.", "summary": "Nice, But Surprise If You Use A Card Swipe", "unixReviewTime": 1442448000}

I want easy access to my credit cards, licenses, and I.D.s, and I have nine of these. My driver's license I place in the flip-out holder with the clear window and the eight others I put in the facing sleeves. Behind the sleeves are two hidden compartments.

Functionally, this wallet is a duplicate to the one I've been using for twenty years, and until now, I've been unable to find a one to replace it.

Joy", "reviewText": "When I was a child, Pokemon first came onto the scene. It burst into our lives, took over our schools and everyone had to have the latest card and have watched the latest episodes, or you just weren't cool! I didn't like Pokemon because everyone else did though, it was something that I really, truly enjoyed! Now that I'm a 27 year old wife and mother of 3, I mostly put my love for Pokemon behind me. Even though I'm not a kid anymore, Pokemon has always been something I loved, and I even still watched the shows and kept my old Pokemon cards (First Edition Holo Charizard over heeerrrreeee!!! LOL!). One day, I was going through my book shelf and pulled out my old binders, filled to the brim with Pokemon cards. Our two oldest kids (a girl, age 9 & a boy, age 7) saw me flipping through the pages and asked what the heck was I doing. I sat down, pulled them close and said \"Let me tell you about a magical world called \"Pokemon\".\" Their ears perked up and their eyes grew wide as I described what it was all about, showing them my cards in between. By the end, they were in love, just as much as I had been! They wanted to watch the show right away! Amazon Prime pulled up the first season, and we sat down for one long marathon! Ever since that day, everything is about Pokemon! I think they enjoy it more than I did (gasp!!)!!! So, naturally, our son wanted a Pokemon themed birthday, and this was one of his gifts. The box is so real looking, it seems as if it jumped right out of the show! When he slowly opened the lid, the sun shown down and lit up the badges. His eyes grew as big as plates and he started screaming! We told him that because of his many Pokemon battles and his great love for each and every Pokemon creature, the Pokemon League has awarded him with the Official Indigo League Badges! He lost all touch with reality and completely lost it! He wanted nothing else than to pin each and every badge on his jacket, and for the rest of the day, he showed ANYONE and EVERYONE his badges, telling everyone about who each Gym Leader was, what Pokemon they had, what they looked like and how hard they were to beat. It's been over a month since his birthday, and he still loves them dearly. He cherishes them beyond words. Something so simple as this, has meant so much to him! As for the product itself, they are amazing! The professional look, right down to the box was unreal. I was NOT expecting that. Each pin was perfect and the colors were very true to what the badges look like. The pin backs have stayed on as well, nothing was loose and the backs are nice and tight. I plan on buying the next badge set for our daughter when her birthday comes around next year, cause ya know, she's totally green eyed on this one! Overall, if you're a big Pokemon fan that's around my age, or just wanting to gift these to a kid you love, you will not be disappointed and neither will the person you're giving these to. I hate to admit it, but I'm even considering buying a set for myself! I promise, I'm a fully functioning adult lol", "summary": "Great gift for ANY Pokemon lover!!", "unixReviewTime": 1460937600}

I gave them a 5 star review praising them.\n\nThe second purchase was for another set of their readers in case they ever went out of business. That's how much I liked their product! Their readers are definitely the best I have ever purchased in over 25 years of using them. I just told my wife a couple of days ago that I'll probably need more powerful lenses before these glasses die.\n\nAfter receiving the first set of readers, I ordered a case to protect them. The case (1st time ordering one) was absolutely perfect in fit and finish, literally. I was once again very impressed by their workmanship and quality control. Another 5 star review from me.\n\nThen I received the second case that I ordered a few days ago. I had really thought that this outfit was the epitome of quality construction before I received this case.\n\nUnfortunately, the top and bottom pieces don't seat properly. This should have certainly been noticed before it was sent out the door.\n\nI played with it for a while and it looks better. However, since I was squeezing it and forcing it out of its initial fit, Im sure it won't stay this way forever.\n\nI was very disappointed in this particular item. I see that it is reverting back to its previous fit after only 24 hours or so. Since it looks somewhat better now (temporarily) I cant be bothered returning it. I just feel let down.\n\nI will still order readers from them when the time comes, but only one set at a time.\n\nP.S. I HAD to select \"Fit as expected\" since the top and bottom are the correct sizes, they just don't fit together.", "summary": "Feeling very let down on this purchase", "unixReviewTime": 1501372800}

The interior amazon box was in perfect condition as was the UPS shipping box from Amazon, so the damage was likely caused in the factory before it was packaged.\n\nTruVision, I was really hoping that 1.25\" interior height would mean it would be thinner and would work better for reading glasses.  If you have a slimline version of this that has a 3/4\" tall interior I'd probably buy multiple.  Even better though, if you have one that is semi-rigid or metal, and has a zipper (metal zipper, not plastic) rather than a hinge, that would be more ideal as the hinges I have used on all other similar products have broken after a month or two of use. Hopefully this hinge lasts longer than other products I have tried.\n\nIt is a nice and professional looking case, I just wish it was thinner and not scuffed up.\n\nUpdate 2016-07-08: I responded the email from TruVision after purchase and they sent a replacement for free.

I was really excited to finally have a belt that I could adjust to my exact size, but I was extremely disappointed by this purchase for a two reasons.\n1) the mechanism to allow the belt to release to take it off is very fickle... It's take some fidgeting around and a bunch of tries with it to get it to fully push down and release. It was extremely frustrating to take on and off even after just trying it on for the first time.\n2) the product looks nothing like the picture shown here. The buckle in the photo looks to be shiny and a nice metal; all and all sharp looking with straight edges. That's not what the belt actually looks like. In actuality, the belt buckle is a bit curved around the sides, detracted from the sharp appearance you might be looking for in a belt. In addition, the metal has a dull and nearly shineless finish.\nAll in all it was a very bad purchase and I regret spending any money on this belt. I don't know the company's return policy, but I will certainly reach out to them to try to find out if I can return this belt and get my money back...\n\nTo follow up - The company was extremely gracious and fully reimbursed me for my purchase. They were super nice and a pleasure to speak to. I admit that it could have been that I received a faulty belt since their mechanisms do usually work according to most of the reviews.

The leather is quite nice and the fit, trim, and stitching seem to be top notch.  All of the card pockets do accept standard size credit/debit/membership cards.  The various pockets behind the card slots make it easy to organize things for easy access.  I have no way of testing the RFID blocking claim, so we'll have to take that on faith.\n\nThis wallet is available in two colors.  Do note that the styes are different as well.  The arrangement of the pockets in one style may suit your purposes better than the other.  I carry only one credit card, two debit cards and a bunch of membership cards.  For me this arrangement allows me to keep my credit/debit cards on the right and my membership cards together on the left, as well as a see-through pocket for my ID.\n\nAlso on the left are two long, thin pockets perfect for carrying paper currency, receipts, and checks needing to be deposited.\n\nUnder the card pockets on the right is a zippered pocket.  It may be intended for coin, but that does not work out well as it's hard to dig out and gets bulky fast.  I use it for a few of my business cards and a spare key (flat metal key, not a bulky plastic transponder key) in case I lock my keys in the truck (again).\n\nUnder that is a deep pocket that works well for carrying a pad of checks and the register as well as a small notebook.\n\nThe only thing I could not get to work in here was my pocket calendar: the pages are a bit too wide.  I may be able to find a smaller calendar that will work, but I'll have to leave the pad of checks at home to make room.  Most businesses accept debit cards, so I probably don't need checks anymore anyway.\n\nThe only warning I'd offer is that the oiled leather is slightly tacky, so if you normally inhabit a dusty or dirty environment, that debris will stick to the leather.  That may diminish over time.  Also, the leather does scar up if it's rubbed against things, but that is stated in the product description, and only adds character to the wallet.", "summary": "An Attractive Wallet That Doubles as an Organizer", "unixReviewTime": 1487894400}

They're cute!\n2. Arrived very fast\n3. Decently priced\n4. Comfy, unlike some nipple jewelry\n\nCons:\n1. They're small. My nipple bars before were long. Which I'm used to. These are small. If you have large nipples I advise you NOT to buy these, due to the fact they most likely won't fit. I had slight trouble getting em on myself, and it took me a few days to get used to the look of such a small piece of jewelry on my nipples\n2. After finally getting them on my one nipple was sore for a day. That could just be my experience due to irritation of trying to get em on\n\nSo, so far I think they're great even if they're small. But as I read, some have gone bad due to them being \"fake jewelry\". In my personal experiences, ALL jewelry I have bought on amazon (which is A LOT) has never went \"bad\". So I don't assume these will. With that being said, if they do start to go bad, I will be back to warn you. If they dont, this will be my only review lol\n\nAll in all, I think they're a great buy (so far!) Lol", "summary": "Cute", "unixReviewTime": 1470528000}

Yet, if it's a little too much, especially since I'm also using thick reusable nursing pads to absorb any leakage, I can remove the extra pad. These seem to be of quality material. The band does stretch out a little bit. I would recommend buying either your normal band size or a band size slightly smaller than your fullest nursing size so that they continue to fit as you settle into your flow.

So dark that when I tried to look at myself in the mirror when I was inside with them on it was hard to tell what the glasses looked like.  The lighting is pretty low inside my house however, so all sunglasse are too dark for inside.  The glasses are great for cutting the sunlight though.  My eyes are pretty sensitive to sunlight so I really like these when Im outside - they keep me from squinting so much which is great.\n\nI really appreciate that these glasses come with a case since Im always scratching up my glasses in my purse.  I also like that there is a cleaning cloth included - all the things you need to keep your sunglasses in good shape!

They say they are jeggings, but they are so thin they might as well be leggings if not just thick tights.  There is really nothing jean-like about them except the 'design'.  The material is definitely not.\n\nSome people have mentioned the odd positioning of the back pockets, and they are indeed odd, but I don't really care about that too much because I've been wearing them with long shirts, and good thing I did because I am currently wearing them to work and I just discovered a hole in the back, above one of the pockets, which I must have missed this morning.  That is pretty annoying because I've only worn them a few times since I got them, and always washed them with the delicate hand wash setting and hung them to dry, so they should certainly not be ripping already.\n\nAnyway, I think I may keep them around just to wear under a dress for a pop of color, like all my other leggings.  This is probably all they're good for to begin with.  And I do like the shade of red.  Not too bright.\n\nSo buy at your own risk, you DO get what you pay for.

However, for the price I do recommend this purchase.  I typically wear 10-12 pants and the L/XL fit exactly as I expected.  I do like the capri length and the spot where the leggings end is snug enough but not at all tight, which is nice.  They don't slide around or ride up.  Someone mentioned these being much nicer than expected and worthy of wearing to the gym...I honestly don't get that from these, even though they do provide good coverage I can't imagine wearing them as \"pants\" even with a longer tunic style top.  I do that with some leggings which are more cottony and similar to athletic shorts/pants, but these are definitely more like hosiery than pants.  The wide waistband and reinforced crotch bring these up to a 4 star rating from the 3 I probably would have rated them otherwise.  Many reviews mention a terrible chemical smell and I DID notice these had an odd smell right out of the package, but I wore them without washing (the first time) and they were fine, I didn't notice the smell while wearing and I have a pretty sensitive sense of smell.

These fit and wear like tights, only they're footless, obviously.  I am 5'4/5'5 and these are not exactly capri length on me, they are mostly ankle length.  I still like the way they fit and I have worn them all day without any discomfort or irritation.  But they do feel like tights when you put them on and when you wear them.  So if you don't like the way tights feel between the thighs when walking, shorts might be suggested.  Also, wash before wearing.

The charms are pretty, well cut (no rough spots), the text is centered on them, & they are super cute.  I'm sure some people may not care for two of the charms that came on mine (\"handmade with love\" is on one charm & \"Made in the USA\" is on the other charm.. I think they are both super cute charms & emphasize that they are handmade.  My daughter also likes them.) but they could be removed if desired.  We are leaving them on the bracelet because we like them in addition to the pink bead charm & the \"Hope for the Cure\" charm.\n\nI think this makes a wonderful gift & I do recommend it.\n\nIn fact we like them so much I just purchased another one at full retail as a gift because we do like it so much.  I will buy more for my other daughters in the future & also some as gifts for my girls' best friends when their birthdays come around.\n\nI will be ordering some additional charms to put on it as we are making a \"purity\" bracelet for one of our daughters to represent those things she is saving for marriage.  I read about the concept in a magazine.  If she decides to give away any of those \"gifts\" (she chooses what her own gifts are for herself, ex.first kiss) & if she decides to give it away before the time frame she decides upon (upon engagement, at the altar, etc.) then she is supposed to give that charm to the one she would give her gift to.  It is a wonderful reminder to help a young woman keep her eye on the prize when temptation may arise.  Our daughter loved the idea when she read about it & so I just surprised her with her bracelet now that she is a teen and will face more temptation as she gets older.\n\nI received a discount on this product for the purpose of my honest review.\n\nDon't worry, I have integrity & do NOT lie in my reviews whether I paid full price or received a discount!\n\nI USED TO think that people who received discounts on reviewed products were all dishonest just trying to get freebies or cheap products for writing fluff-filled reviews whether they actually liked the product or not, but I have since found out how things work and I mostly disagree with that now. I can't say that some people don't do that, but I can say that my experience has been a good one & the way I find products is I look for things I NEED & WANT, so I almost always have knowledge about them before ordering something. If it is the first time I've used a certain product I disclose that also in my review. That knowledge gives me some advantage in writing my reviews because I know what to look for in a product, how it may compare to others, etc. & then I can write a fair, honest, & hopefully helpful review!\n\nI know that Amazon reviews are helpful & so many people look at them to decide if they should purchase a product. I also know seeing so many reviews from certain products that seem like they are all from discounts or freebies can be deeply discouraging. Take heart & know that my experience has been that many of the reviewers genuinely want to give you a fair & honest review. Again, there are some who use a product once or twice & then write a glowing review, but I'm not talking about them. I'm talking about those who take the time to THOROUGHLY test a product before writing a review. They don't write reviews after 3 days of receiving a product just because someone may want them to pound out a bunch of reviews in 72 hours.\n\nFeel free to ask me any questions. I will do my best to follow up if you do.\n\nIf you found my review candid & helpful, please click on the YES button below.\n\nThank you!", "summary": "TARNISHED!!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1460851200}

I have PCOS and the awareness ribbon color is the same as Ovarian Cancer so when I saw this bracelet, I knew I wanted the teal color beaded bracelet to wear for my own hope during my struggle with PCOS.\n\nThis cancer awareness bracelet is beautiful. It's adjustable so it should fit an array of wrist sizes, so you don't have to worry about it being too small. The charms are very sturdy, I don't expect them to weaken or break off. The bracelet is a little thin and might bend a little bit, but I know people who have real Alex and Ani bracelets that have bent. The beads are beautiful but they are a little lighter in color than I expected. While it was a teal color to me it was more of a light green than a bluish-green teal color.\n\nI think this bracelet is perfect for anyone who has been affected by cancer in any capacity. I also think it makes a wonderful gift for anyone fighting or a survivor as a gesture of hope and it's perfect for anyone to show they support the battle against cancer. I will be buying another one of these bracelets in the dark purple for pancreatic cancer to wear in memory of my godmother who succumbed to that terrible disease.\n\nThe Cancer Awareness Bracelets made by Hidden Hollow beads are just fabulous and affordable. I love that a portion of the sale goes to the ACS. Not only are you getting a lovely piece of jewelry but you are also helping to fund the fight against cancer with your purchase. That is just wonderful.\n\nI received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

The blue purse came with a detachable shoulder strap, which is just right in length for my 6 year old, or she can take the strap off and use it as a clutch.  The pink purse is a little bit smaller in size and came with a detachable shoulder strap and a detachable hand strap, so it would be perfect to give to a smaller child because you could attach the smaller, beaded hand strap for them to use to carry it around.

I have a very small wrist and it is pliable enough that I was able to easily close it around my wrist for a tight fit.

As another reviewer stated, it is a bit large for a smaller wrist & hand.  The bracelet's well-made, & the beads are hefty.  The beads are much larger than the beads on the multi-layered mala prayer bead bracelets.  I find the beads on this bracelet to be much easier to use for meditation/prayer.  If you look carefully at the obsidian beads in the bright sunlight, you can see greys & greens etc, making the bracelet even more interesting.  My tiger eye beads are not nearly as red as the picture; mine are more brownish.  I was really hoping for the red colouring like in the picture, so that was a little disappointing.  The dragon bead is larger than the obsidian & tiger eye beads.  The dragon is engraved & painted a shiny gold.  There are some parts, like the spikes on the back of the head & some of the toes, where it looks as if it was painted on the bead without the engraving.  If those parts are indeed engraved, it's not very obvious compared to the other parts of the dragon's body.  The dragon's head on my bracelet is much different from the picture.  The dragon in the picture has thick, strong jaws.  My dragon has a round cheek & a very thin jaws, which are open with a thin line of a tongue sticking out.  Also, on my bead & not shown on the picture, my dragon bead has a golden circle between the dragons head & tail, so it looks like the dragon's chasing the moon/sun or a golden ball.  Even though my dragon's not exactly like the one pictured, I still like it.  Perhaps it's hand-engraved rather than mass produced, making each bracelet unique.  Despite the difference in the colouring of the tiger eye beads, I would recommend this bracelet to anyone looking for this type of bracelet.", "summary": "Great Bracelet", "unixReviewTime": 1470268800}

I don't think it's much of a concern but the bracelet is larger than I expected it to be which is not necessarily a bad thing since it doesn't get to the point where it falls off or anything; it sits nice in my hand.

It feels great on your skin and is thin enough to layer, but thick enough that it isn't see through.  Although it got a little wrinkled while shipping, it is a fairly wrinkle free material that makes it great for travel.\nThe only slight down side is that the top of the sleeves is slightly restricting.

Sometimes when I get more form fitting shirts, my waistline can get lost behind the girls, so having it not be fitted in the stomach area, really helps mask their size a little bit. The arms also feel nice and stretchy and the threading around the armpit and wrist aren't really tight, so you can easily roll up your sleeves and make a different look out of it!\nI received this shirt at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.", "summary": "This shirt is so comfortable!", "unixReviewTime": 1445472000}

However, in retrospect, the material has so much give that I think a medium may have fit around my waist better. Although the dress fits and looks nice, it doesnt fit snuggly around my waist at all. Additionally, the dress was too long, but I was expecting that. Because the hem wasn't surged anyway, I didn't feel bad using a seam ripper to carefully detach the bottom three bandages.

Overall this is a reliable product for the price and I would recommend it to anyone looking for this particular fashion style.", "summary": "Excellent Product", "unixReviewTime": 1449014400}

Breathable, lightweight but sturdy, and comfortable during all my workouts. The built-in arch support is great and I've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use. As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes, I would consider these a 'medium' build (not thin, not overly thick) so if you're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration.

The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.\n\n**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them.

I am 5' 9\", 140 pounds, and normally wear US size M or L, depending on the measurements. I ordered the XL for this dress and it fits me absolutely perfectly. I really recommend you measure yourself and follow the size chart when ordering. The length is quite long, as pictured on the product page, so if you plan to wear it outside, make sure to either pin it up or be prepared to hold it. I wore it to the Renaissance Festival for my Galadriel costume and I ended up tucking it into a belt so it wouldn't get dirty. It is 100% white. Not cream, not eggshell. Pure white.\n\nOne thing I was surprised about is how soft the lace is. Some lace can be scratchy and rough, but this lace is like liquid against the skin. I'd definitely recommend wearing something under this gown, though. It is completely see-through and thin. It could work as a beach cover-up or even a wedding gown, or in my case, for cosplay purposes. It's versatile and beautiful and I highly recommend it!

I am 5 foot 2, and this has about 3 inches of material that touches the ground. So, if you want to wear shoes, or heels too kind of dress it up a little bit, it's not an issue and it's still going to be beautiful.\n\nI love that the lace is not the cheap itchy kind of life, it's really soft. I don't think that I would ever put this in the washing machine common not unless it was on the gentle cycle and in a delicate wash bag. The lace is so soft and kind of silky, I just don't even want to ruin that.\n\nThis is going to be perfect for the summer time, it can also even be warn over a slip, or something else it's very form fitting like a bodycon dress, just to give it that perfect kind of layering effect. I would have absolutely no problem wearing a bodycon dress under this and having date night!!! I put a belt around it just to see what it would look like, because around the waist there is the stitching, and is not horrible looking at all, but if I was going to wear this to a date night, I would definitely want to throw a belt around it. Just to give it that extra added flair. I did show this to a really good friend of mine who is really into cosplay and she is in love with it. I'm really glad we aren't the same size...\n\nI think this is beautiful, I love the fact that it's versatile, there's so many different things that you can wear this with, you can dress it up, dress it down, go to the beach, lounge around the hotel pool looking all diva. I love it. I would definitely recommend this 100%. It's really well made, and the stitching is really nice, it's beautiful, and it's different.\n\nPromotional or discounted product provided to review.", "summary": "Beautiful and not itchy type of a lace, well made!", "unixReviewTime": 1453075200}

The part in the front that gathers the fabric at your midsection bunches up causing you to look like you have a pouch of belly fat. No woman wants to look like they have EXTRA weight in that area!!! The picture of the model as advertised for this dress is clearly posing forward. I'm assuming if she turned to the side,you would see the bunch of fabric gathered in her mid section. There is no way to truly \"FIX\" the issues with this dress. I tried. The only other option is to try and shrink it in the dryer but I'm not even sure if that will work. Its simply a poorly constructed dress that is not complimenting the female form. I'm convinced that you would have to try and singe the back of the dress to make it more form fitting and get rid of the pouch...but there is no guarantee that will work.

My only real issue with the dress, thus the 4 instead of 5 star rating, is that the buttons suck and will need to be changed out (at least for my tastes).

I received them within a week after purchasing them. The diffraction is great, splits every light that you see through the glasses into every color in the spectrum, while also making somewhat of a kaleidoscope effect. This works best when either you or the light is moving. The only downside to this effect is that you will not be able to see around you (excluding the pretty lights) if you are in the crowd at a rave for example. This can lead to bumping into several people, like I did the first time using them. (I recommend rocking them almost librarian-style, low on the bridge of the nose so you can see around the frame of the glasses)\nthe mirrored outside is great, a perfect mirror, really. Nobody will be able to see your eyes. Trust me. They are of solid construction, much better than the disposable type of paper framed diffraction glasses, and completely worth the money. I highly recommend them. The only reason I cannot rate it as a 5 star item, is because when you wear them at a rave dancing can become difficult, because you won't be able to see the people around you.

I figured I could just cut off those strings and wear it like that because there was no reason for those straps I the first place. as soon as I put the dress on one strap broke.\nI wouldn't recommend this to anyone.", "summary": "I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.", "unixReviewTime": 1435622400}

I'm six feet tall and while the dress isn't technically too short to wear (it covered everything it needs to) it was too short for my comfort so I'll need to wear it with leggings. Which is fine because with fall coming up, it is the perfect season for leggings.\nThe dress is pretty form fitting.  It was clingy which would normally not be a big issue, but having recently had twins, the dress showed more of me than I would usually like. That being said, with spanx or other shapewear, it would have evened everything out.\nThe dress itself is really comfortable.  the stretchy material is soft and even though it is a bit thicker, it isn't too hot.

It's also got exactly enough organization with the couple of pockets for me to have the 2 cards I use most in the outside pocket, 8 in the larger pocket on the inside, and the 2 discount cards I use the most often in the smaller pocket on the inside. I have my driver's id in the window pocket, and it wasn't one of those situations where when you have to take it out, you have to fight to get it out, so that's been very useful as well. I really like that I'm no longer concerned with whether I might have accidentally left a card at home when I don't see it right away - I hadn't realized how much I was doing that until I wasn't anymore. Because if I have the wallet, I'm sure it's in there.\n\nInitially it was a bit bulky with all of that in it, and the flap wouldn't quite close when it was out of my pocket unless I laid it flap side down, but time in my pocket has worn it in a bit, the leather has done a bit of stretching, and the flap stays down now no matter what side is up.", "summary": "Perfect for my purposes", "unixReviewTime": 1415923200}

And my bulges were no longer concealed anyway. I kept wearing it but you see these give you the illusion that it's actually resculpting your body into a \"perfect hourglass figure\" it's not. It's squeezing your water weight to give you that illusion. Also. It was very uncomfortable to lay in it (never slept in it, don't do that anyway it's not safe to) there were times where I had to immediately take it off to prevent fainting which I felt like I was going to had I kept it on. But the worst thing this corset trainer did was mess up my ribs. It's hard to explain but it pushed up a lot of my \"fat\" if you will (haha) up in2 my ribs that I never noticed until recently (1 and a half months of use in total) my ribs don't feel broken or anything but they feel more spaced apart and pushed upward.

It is breathable, so I didn't have to worry about overheating during a workout. The breathable material seems strong too. It hasn't ripped with me poking my fingers through it but I did break a nail getting it on :-) For reference, I am 5'1\" and the length of this waist trainer worked great for me.\n\nThe hook and eye closure hold strong and are easy to get closed. I ordered true to my waist size. The overall manufacture is done fine but I would suggest slightly stronger boning and a double stitch throughout (instead of the less secure single stitch) to take it up to the next level. Still, I think it works well as a starter waist cinching garment because it is relatively comfortable and thus easy enough to help you get accustomed to having a slimming garment on for a long period. It can also help to get you a better silhouette under garments but they need to be made of thick material to remain invisible under your clothes.\n\nI received this #SEXYWG product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

The fitted top ends slightly below the bust area and not right underneath it. The skirt area is gathered at the top and has a slight loose fit flow to it. Im 57 and this dress hits right under my ankles.

The material does allow for stretch. I suggest going up at least one size large than you would normally wear. This XXL is like a US dress size 16.\n\nOverall this dress is an excellent price. It gives you a long and lean look. This dress is very versatile. You can wear this casual with flip flop or dress this up with gorgeous jewelry and heels. It would be really cute with a fashionable belt or scarf. There are so many ways to change this dress up. The best part is, the dress is super comfortable. It seems to be great for all body types.

Unfortunately, the fabric does not stretch at all, otherwise this may have worked. I've ordered the XXL to try next with hopes that the bust will be a few inches larger. I know this might mean the waist will be roomier, but I can always take that in. If the XXL fails, I may try to extend the bust of the XL on the left side. (Right side has a hidden zipper.) I'll have to talk to a seamstress friend to see if this is definitely possible, but looking at the seam it does seem like there is a little that can be let out - maybe an inch. As for the split in the front and back - yes this would show your underwear while walking, but if you look at the set photos of Daenerys she is always wearing pants and boots with this dress.

Reviews were more than good, so I was happy & took a chance. My Bracelet/ring was way to big, swirled all around & just had no practical use (It really was mis-shaped). Yes I did read the product description & still mine was off. So I did all the right things, followed the required steps (protocol) & had a few emails directly w/OVERMAL who right off the bat choose to reimburse me $5, w/out an issue. They then asked me for pictures, which I provided, but they must have not cared as my piece probably didn't meet their \"whatever\"....then changed their minds to reimburse me a $1 (which I didn't even get). The $1 was degrading. Basically it's not about the cost AT all, Customer Service should always be #1 & they definitely don't fall into that category.\n** I since then have made numerous purchases from all different Sellers (from Jewelry to Art to Clothes....& my FAVORITE category: THE WALKING DEAD any items Sellers bring on) so if something comes damaged or not like it was advertised I do send them a professional comment. Every Seller has exceeded my expectations & been very helpful in every way.\n** In no way am I being too picky (if I do order something that fit incorrectly, that's on me) but Sellers should know their buyers opinions, which is why Amazon has reviews, complaint/filing claims options and such (of course when an item comes damaged, it's complicated because it could be the Seller's packaging or our Delivery person just throwing the item.\n**** HOWEVER, I LOVE & VERY SATISFIED WITH 99% OF MY BUYS & will try to get my positive reviews on their page as soon as I can.\nThank you.", "summary": "OVERMAL: VERY, VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!", "unixReviewTime": 1461888000}
