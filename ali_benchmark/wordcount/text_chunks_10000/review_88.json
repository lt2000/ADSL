Online it does say the dimensions but for some reason it does look on the larger side. I have to say it does look really funky and different. It looks like it was made by hand, which it is, and it has its own personality. I really like how this piece has multi colored beads and a very cool twist of the metal wires to form the tree. Once I tried it on I fell in love with it and really like it. I constantly get comments about it and I like the multi colors, which give it a more flexibility on what you can wear with it.\n\nWhat is really nice is that the necklace comes with two different chains to hang it from around your neck. One is literally a metal chain while the other is a black string with metal to connect it together. This is a real nice extra accessory that really pushed me to give it 5 stars. It also comes with a really neat black velvet carrying bag for the necklace and the 2 chains.\n\nOverall, I am very impressed with the quality and with the price, and I got use to the size.

I purchased this pair in the blue/green striped design in the size medium for my husband who has a 32 waist in US sizes. These fit him comfortably and did not appear baggy or big. There were no loose strings on the board shorts. Also you can adjust the drawstring to tighten them. These board shorts are very light and thin so they should dry easily. They may be a little too thin to be worn without anything under them.\n\nI will note that when I placed my order, I thought I was ordering swim trunks sinc that was what was listed in the title. I was a bit disappointed that these were not swim trunks with a net on the inside, but rather board shorts. When I looked back at the seller website the title also said board shorts and in the description it outlined \"no net inside,\" so I must have overlooked that. Taking out the word swim trunk in the title may help other buyers from making the same error.\n\nSo while I was a bit disappointed these weren't swim trunks, they are an attractive pair of board shorts that fit true to size. The reason why I didn't give these a 5 star was that I felt the material may be a little thinner than some other board shorts on the market and would need to have something be worn under.\n\nDisclaimer: I received this pair of board shorts at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased feedback.", "summary": "These are BOARD SHORTS not swim trunks, they fit and look good!", "unixReviewTime": 1468627200}

Stainless steel, very large with a navy blue face... In short it is a gorgeous watch that has a very professional look, I consistently receive positive comments on it appearance. I do not care for digital watches and most if not all smart watches are digital, so when I saw this watch I was instantly intrigued as to its smart watch capabilities. That being said I do believe its a stretch to put this watch into that category. I found it difficult to register it with the app, finally I was able to do so and then syncing it was time consuming and frustrating to say the least. Once I paired it with my I -phone it was a breeze to set the time and date.. Lets just say you can manage your watch completely from your phone, it was very nice in that respect..... This is not a phone for the extremely health conscious person who wants exact numbers on caloric burn or distances ran through extensive exercise regimen. It is however nice for the active professional that likes to stay on the go and just wants some idea of the number of steps during the day... I did find the battery life to be poor but it could be because of the vibration notifications being set to high for incoming calls and texts messages. You can adjust it lower but I found I was missing important texts and calls at the lower settings. The current limit for storing phone numbers is 6 which I find to be very lacking as I have many many contacts I wish to monitor for communications during the work day. At the end of the day its still an attractive watch with limited smart capabilities, and for the average person that doesn't need bleeding edge technology on their wrist its most satisfying.", "summary": "Calling it a smartwatch is a stretch.", "unixReviewTime": 1492387200}

I have a very strong suspicion that the apps and smart technology are the same.\n\nWhat I like about the smart features:\nI like how it gives me subtle notifications on my wrist, rather than having my phone buzzing loudly (or beeping). I use it for text/facebook messages, traffic alerts, calendar alerts, and phone calls. For alerts, it's just a light buzz on my wrist that lets me know that I should look at my phone (or, in the case of my commute, that traffic on my usual route is backed up). For phone calls, it's a stronger, persistent buzzing that's unmistakable.\n\nWhat I don't like about the smart features:\nIt's possible to set dial behavior so that you can distinguish between the alerts, but that just means you have to decipher what number it's pointing at when you get the alert (and also that you have to check right away).\nYou're also limited in how many apps / contacts you can get notifications for (currently limited to 6). That's enough for me right now, but maybe it won't be in the future? Maybe it's not enough for you? It's just an arbitrary number so that they watch doesn't burn through its battery, but I wish that were something left up to me, instead of being a hard limit.\n\nI also don't like that I have to use the Michael Kors Access app. \"Yay, another single-function app I have to use!\" said nobody ever. Sure, it'll sync up with Google Fit, but the sleep data is locked into the proprietary MK app.\n\nAppearance-wise, this watch is pretty good. I'm not thrilled with how busy the face looks, but the rest of the watch looks nice and feels like a high-quality adult timepiece, rather than having the gimmicky look of a traditional LCD-faced smartwatch. I do wish the stems stuck out a little less, but they don't look out of place on a watch with a big face like this one.\n\nMy big complaint with this watch is that the vibrations are weak. They're noticeably weaker than the Skagen's -- I basically can't feel the lightest setting, although the strongest setting is enough to notice.\n\nBecause of that weak vibration, I'd purchase the Skagen over the Michael Kors watch. But if you really like the look of this Michael Kors one, it's pretty much functionally identical to the Skagen.", "summary": "Attractive hybrid smart watch with standard features, weak vibration", "unixReviewTime": 1489276800}

It's supposed to track steps accurately, calories burned and distance. After I paired it - I tested it out and walked and jogged around the house for a few min and it only tracked 2 steps. It hasn't gotten any better.\nThis watch is not water proof so if you wanted to swear or swim or shower in it, you really can't. It's vaguely water-resistant only.\nThe battery life is also pretty low- only UP to 6 months per replacement (which as a brand new watch currently shows 33 percent battery life through the Michael Kors app).\nAlthough you can check the date on the watch- the side panel numbers are so small and I have perfect vision- I can not even make out the numbers clearly.\nOverall- I feel that despite the sleek look and nice quality on this watch (it's heavy)...it falls short of being smart.", "summary": "The not so smart, smartwatch", "unixReviewTime": 1489017600}

I really enjoy having clothing that is a bit different.  I love showing up to work in clothing that other people don't own, and can't be found at Target.  These dresses definitely fit the bill!  There are so many fun patterns and designs to choose from!  I ended up buying five different dresses, one from each of the different series offered.  Once you have one, you will want more!\n\nThe dresses are very well made.  The fabric is thick, but not so thick that it is stiff.  It has some give to it, but isn't super stretchy.  It really feels like what brocaded fabric should feel like, which is good, since it is all brocade.  The seams to the dresses are all tight and finished.  The zippers are hidden zippers running up the back, and have those nice long oblong zipper pulls, which allows me to zip my own dresses up and down, because the pull is long enough.  The zippers all run smoothly, with no catching point on the dress.  The fabric is very soft and has a bit of a silky feel to it.  All the seams are smooth inside, so there is nothing scratchy or irritating about it.\n\nThe dress is a fit and flare dress, with a fitted waist.  You will need to pull this dress over your head to put it on, as your hips won't fit through the waist of this dress, unless you have very tiny hips.  The skirt part of the dress bubbles out a bit, giving it a natural body.  You won't need any crinoline to get that extra fluff.  Not that many people use crinolines these days, but I do wear one occasionally, so this is good to know, if you are like me, and like these types of dresses to have a little extra \"floof\" at the bottom.\n\nThe sleeve holes are perfectly sized, and you don't have to worry about exposing too much through the arm holes.  I you want the top fitted a bit more around the arm holes (the fabric does stick out a tiny bit), it is easily fixed with one dart.\n\nI am 5'3\" and 130 pounds.  Normally I wear a US size 4, but in these dresses, I wear an 8.  It comes with an XL label.  Definitely go by their size chart, not the size chart of Amazon.  If you go by their size chart, you will be right on with sizing.\n\nThese dresses do run a bit short, which for some women is not a problem.  For me, I am too modest to wear something this short to work on its own.  I will definitely have to be wearing hosiery with these.\n\nThis is going to look so cute with cardigans and tights in the fall and winter!  Tall boots will be fun with this too!\n\nThe colors are vibrant, and look exactly like the images on Amazon.  They feel as if they have been woven into the fabric, but they were probably printed on - I don't know for sure, though, as I don't really know anything about fabric design.  All I know is that I LOVE this dress line!\n\nI give these dresses an enthusiastic five stars!  Love, love, love these dresses!", "summary": "Wow do I love these dresses!

It does crease a bit where it is tied (as do most cotton ties, from my experience), so I recommend hanging it after wear or gently pressing it if you intend on trying different knots where those creases may show. It arrived quickly and was simply packaged but was in great shape and I wore it right out of the package without any issue.\n\nIf you are looking for a nice looking, somewhat casual tie, this is a great choice. The quality and price are both very reasonable.

Its super comfortable, but also has a little bit of sexiness so my husband is a fan too.\n\nI ordered the XXL and its a little big on me.  I am a size 12 generally in US womens but I have a tendency to order larger as I have a larger bust. I probably could have gone with an XL, but Im not dissatisfied with the XXL as the straps are adjustable and I have plenty of room in the bust area.  Im relatively short at 52, so this comes down to just past my knees.\n\nThe material feels wonderful and the lace is so soft and pretty. This really is a beautiful nightgown.  I ordered the red and my husband told me it reminded him of Christmas, which I thought was funny.  While its not actual real silk, it feels great and it is very comfortable as well.  The quality is great and Im pleased with this nightgown overall.\n\nI received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.", "summary": "Very pretty!", "unixReviewTime": 1468713600}

These are currently my favorite pajamas for my 4 year old and 1 year old daughters. The fabric is thick and soft. It's ribbed, but such tiny ribbing that it just adds to the plush feel and nice stretch. The 4T size is just a touch big on my small 4yo, which is nice because it fits her now, but she will be able to wear the set for quite a while. The robot graphic is adorable. I initially purchased this item because my 4 year old loves robots and pretending to be a robot. I was surprised and delighted by the product quality. I particularly like the cut of the shorts. They are long - about knee length. My girls wear cloth diapers, and I find that a lot of \"girls\" clothing (which is silly at this age - clothes are clothes) is cut very short. That doesn't usually work well with a fluffy cloth diaper bum. This such a great set and really nice quality at this price point. After receiving this set for my 4 year old daughter, I immediately sought out more and ordered a pair for my 1 year old. I will definitely be purchasing more of these in the future and have already let some of my mom friends know how great they are.\n\nI purchased this item at a discount in return for my honest review, but this has had no impact on my opinion.

Please note that this is during July and August in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S.\n\nThe photos I included show photos of the leather up close for you to decide on the quality based on what you know. I examined the treated underside and how it naps over time, the belt loop, the belt holes, and the texture of the outer lining. See the cons section as to why the photos were taken this way.\n\nAs a young guy, this belt starts my foray into leather belts after wearing synthetic leather department store belts my whole life. To day the least, this is hands down the most comfortable belt I have worn in my whole life so far. I've worn it with jeans and business casual attire and it looks great. Not to mention that the color of this belt matches most cognac, walnut, or tan leather shoes and watch straps. I almost thought about returning it for reasons mentioned further down the review, but ultimately, I couldn't do it. The following reasons offer a brief summary of what makes the belt good.\n\nPros:\n- The belt is really supple and It broke in very well after the 2nd day of use. Since then it's been very easy to bend and loop around my pants.\n- It feels very nice to the touch, it's not oiled like a dressy watch strap, so it has a slight suede to it even though it's not suede.\n- The buckle is round and comfortable, and it doesn't poke and stab my gut like all my previous belts have (both round and square buckles)\n- The color started as a cognac color and has darkened a shade or two since wearing the belt (indicator of real leather).\n\nCons:\nMy biggest criticism of the watch is about how there's no definitive way to tell what grade of leather this is. The description says full grain leather, but I figured that a company would be proud of that and rightly plant it on the belt itself like most other companies do. I have the $7 full grain leather belt from costco that even has the \"full grain leather\" stamp on it. A summary of other minor cons are below.\n\n- There is a loose stitch at the end of one of the buckle leather pieces\n- The buckle has no indent to hold the pin, thus it moves the belt slightly. It's hard to notice though\n- The buckle comes with some sanding and indenting already to give it a \"vintage\" feeling. I can see where people might find this off-putting\n- The underside has some sort of treatment to prevent napping, I would've preferred the natural nap as shown in the belt loop.", "summary": "Good for replacing department store belts", "unixReviewTime": 1506211200}

It's maybe slightly longer than I need, but it's a good fit.

It has a small zippered compartment on the inside. The outside of the bag also has a zippered pocket. The bag seems very sturdy and well constructed. Upon arrival it did have a unpleasant odor. I allowed the bag to air out overnight for two days and after that the smell was gone. It does ship internationally from China so it took a little time to get here (apx 2 weeks). The bag also came with a Z joyee change purse. I did receive this bag at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. The bag does not come with the journal , I put that there for size reference. I plan to use it as an every day tote to carry my binder and papers for work and school.

It is bigger than Jansport Half Pint and slightly smaller than Roxy Always Core.  Jansport has cover over the zipper but there's no lining and no padding.  The straps are webbing that can dig into shoulders when the load is too heavy.  It also has a key stay that both Mini Kane and Always Core don't have.  Mini Kane and Always Core are lined and have padded regular width shoulder strap.\n\nMini Kane is made of fabric used for most school backpacks; tough and long lasting.  The padding is on the backside, bottom, and part of the sides.  It is meant to protect the tablet.  However, the main compartment has no tablet sleeve or a zip pouch.  The outside pocket is slightly gusseted but not meant for any bulky item (won't zip up).  The side pockets have velcro tabs but the sewing is sub-part (mine is already unraveling).  If you have a big Android phone, the pocket may be too small for it.  Sunglasses without case is fine though.  The satiny webbing is also sewn on the strap that you can affix a biner or two.  Because the webbing is satiny, it is hard to have it stay at the length you desire.  To fix it, just use a 1\" safety pin to not having to adjust shoulder straps.\n\nIf you are looking for a fashion backpack that doesn't look like a school pack and is comfortable to carry, this is a good choice.  The dino camo is brilliant!  It is the reason I bought it (because I already have Roxy Always Core and Jansport Half Pint).  I just got a pterodactyl pin before I found this backpack.  It was fate.

I ordered a size small for him based on the sizing chart and other reviewers recommendations. When they arrived he was initially unhappy with the color, as they appear far more yellow than khaki. However, he tried them on and said they were comfortable so he would be fine wearing them.\n\nThe shorts are very long, and they reached halfway past his knees, but for some reason the crotch area was very tight, almost as if they were made for a woman's physique... Everything was on full display, and the seam in the middle of the shorts was dividing 'things' VERY obviously. (Google 'moose knuckle' if you're unsure what I'm trying to allude to.) It was a bit ridiculous how much was on display!\n\nI would have chalked it up to the sizing being off, and ordered him a larger size in another color, but I had ordered my dad a pair of the same shorts in an extra large and he had the exact same problem. The shorts fit correctly everywhere except for the crotch area. The length, waist, and butt area fit fine, but you'd have to be a woman to wear these and not turn a few heads! Yikes!\n\nUnfortunately I ended up returning both pairs, which was disappointing because they were a great price.\nAs an addicted Amazon buyer, I rely on real people's opinions to make educated decisions about what items are worth it to spend my hard-earned money on.

The material thickness is consistent throughout the garment without a distinct waist band, so these leggings are probably not the best to wear for high impact or movement intensive activities.  They are definitely perfect for yoga, though!\n\nI purchased these leggings at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.

Overall I am happy with them but there are a few little things that could be better.\n\nThe mesh is very breathable and although I do not think they are actually water shoes, they can easily be worn to a splash pad or something, as they dry pretty quickly. My baby wore them to a water park and they worked great. I did take off a star for texture...it is SUPER rough and scratchy. The girls did not seem to be bothered by it too much but they are not the most comfortable thing to put on them.\n\nThe color is as advertised...we got the purple ones and the girls were thrilled. Very pretty shades of purple...they compliment each other well.\n\nThe arch support is pretty flimsy, also why only 4 stars.\n\nThe neoprene rim around the top is great...keeps the shoes on very well. I sized up too much for my littlest and despite being too big, they stayed on her feet all 5 hours we were at a water park in and out of the pool, slides, etc. and only slipped off a couple of times. My other daughter whose fit perfectly had no issues.\n\nLOVE the double loop. Makes them SUPER easy to get off and on...use the loop on top to help slide the foot in and then pull up the back with the back loop. Excellent feature. I especially appreciated after I tried to get a different pair of water shoes on the almost 2-year old.\n\nThey fit slightly on the smaller side but not awful. You might need to size up.\n\nCute style. They look really cute...not so narrow as other mesh shoes I have seen.\n\nNice, thick sole. Keeps their feet very well protected from rocks, rough pool bottoms, hot asphalt, etc. Also has good tread. We had no problems with slipping on the wet pool area.\n\nOverall, they do exactly what I need them to do so I am pleased with the purchase. I have some that are nearly identical and they keep my feet pretty cool, are easy to slip on, and fairly comfortable to wear. My feet have no arches so I need more support than shoes like these offer but kids run around in flip flops without problems where I feel like my feet are going to fall off from hurting so much so the girls have had no issues with wearing them for several hours at a time. If you are looking for orthopedic support, these are not it. But they work great for easy summer shoes. Disclaimer: I was fortunate enough to receive these at a discount in exchange for my honest opinion and unbiased review. I rely very heavily on the reviews of others because I do nearly all my shopping online so I strive to leave helpful feedback on both items I buy at full price and those which I have received for free or at a discount.

As soon as he saw this, it was instantly his favorite. He works in a home improvement store, so having a wooden watch is a really cool thing to have, and the design and size of this one is simply stunning. He says he gets more questions and compliments on this watch than he ever has on anything else.\n\nWhat we like:\n*  My husband says his favorite part about this watch is the size. He likes bigger watches and this one is the perfect size according to him. Big bold face that looks great on his fairly large wrist.\n*  The overall coloring. The Zebrawood looks absolutely stunning, and it is a real eye catcher. It still looks like wood, but the zebra look to it just takes it to another level.\n*  The time is easily read, and the Roman Numerals look great. It adds another layer of class to it, and the dials look great as well. Substantial and easily seen, even in the dark since the dials glow in the dark.\n*  Easy to set with the crown on the side, and it isn't so big that it hurts the wrist when you bend your hand all the way back.\n*  The band with the flexible wood links looks great. So professional and adds even more class to it. Also comes with lots of links, so its easily adjustable for almost anyone to wear.\n*  The foldover clasp makes it very easy to put on and take off with one hand.\n*  My husband has been wearing this every single day for over a week now, and it still doesn't have any scratches on the face.\n*  Comes in a lovely box sitting on a black leather pillow, so it would make an excellent gift!\n\nWhat we don't like:\n1) This watch DOES NOT tolerate water other than in very small amounts, like washing your hands and then drying underneath it. The wood will swell up and the links won't move anymore, and it may even affect the watch itself if it absorbs too much.\n\nOverall, My husband thinks this is a fantastic watch and he is thrilled with it. It was given to him as a gift from me and he didn't like that I kept it for a day so I could take the pictures and video for this. Its always his first choice watch and we couldn't be happier with it!\n\n**I purchased this watch at a promotional discount for the purposes of testing and reviewing, but my cost has absolutely no bearing on how I rate a product. I will NEVER give a positive review to an item that doesn't fully deserve it.**", "summary": "Has become my husbands favorite watch! He loves it!", "unixReviewTime": 1470787200}

In a short period of time, you can simply remove the links yourself to have the watch fit as needed. It can fit my very small femine wrist (a little lose when sized completely down) and it fits a little loose (what hes customed to) on my husband's very large wrist with no links removed. It has a metal band clasp, where the compressing strenth is about mid-range so not hard to undo but you don't have to worry about the black time set button or the clasp getting caught on something or bumped and coming undone. The numbers are set up in black roman numberals and don't stand out a whole lot to be flashy but all numbers on the face, can be easily read with average sight at proper arms length. The bright glow in the dark hour and minute hands are very easy to be seen in the day or at night. It is a big watch but not chunky or thick to get in the way of movement or clothes. Light weight and yet, not a delicate watch because of the wood they chose to make it from. This is not a dressy watch but it definately works for work, whether its a uniform, jeans or dockers. It may work with a suit depending on the suit. It will work for a night out clubbing, day on the golf course, enjoying a sporting event or dinner and movie with your special someone. It is not easy to find a watch that works well but is also unique looking...this one is both! Not only is it unique to well known brand watches, it's one of a kind since every grain of wood is one of a kind! I can't believe how they use texture and color to make such a statment in this piece...it's truly a piece of art! Packaging and presentation in the gift box makes it even more special, IF we wanted to give it away. While its designed for a man, it would still make a beautiful fashion statement when worn by a woman! I really don't see this watch as being age or sex specific. It really would make an amazing gift for anyone and has proven to be a great conversation starter. Oh, also, I have checked, normally watches like these can easily exceed $200 with other companies so give as a gift and they will think you have spent much more on their gift. I have attached pictures of how it came in the beautiful box and what it looks like on my wrist with no links taken off, since it is now my husband's watch. I received this watch for free for my unbiased honest opinion according to my own and my husband's experience with this beautifully unique time piece.", "summary": "Gorgeous time piece for a man or woman!", "unixReviewTime": 1470096000}

The band is plenty long enough and some links can be taken off if it's too big. It has a stainless steel clasp and is made of sapphire crystal so it's scratch resistant. It's not waterproof so keep it out of pools and the shower but if it gets very lightly splashed it should be ok. It uses roman numerals instead of numbers which is different.

I have big boobs, so I did have to take this padding out, but the material is thick enough with the dual layers that I don't need it anyway. A stylish sports bra and shorts for a swimsuit anyday!!

They look almost identical, block approximately the same amount of light, and are similarly polarized as the originals.  The fit isn't 100%, but it is very close.  A common complaint with other replacement brands were they are noticeably thinner and more flimsy than the original lenses, but from my naked eye observation, these are the same thickness.  Once in, I was blown away by their clarity.  In fairness, that is also a function of how scratched up my old lenses were, but still something to note.\n\nI will absolutely be buying another set or two.

I opened a Word document, and the key strokes were very responsive with no errors. Personally, I thought that the touch pad was as fast and responsive as the ones on my laptops.\n\nWhen i tested it on my android TV box, and it was so very much better than the remote that came with the TV box. The touch pad worked well as a mouse, and data entry was so much easier. I also very much like that pressing FN and 6 lights the keyboard. So it can be used in the dark. This keyboard would also be very beneficial for use with a laptop when using a mouse is not convenient. In my opinion, this keyboard would be useful. for any device that the USB dongle can be plugged in.\n\nThis keyboard comes with a USB charging cable and the 2.4 GHz USB dongle can be plugged in. It also comes with a user guide that plainly describes the uses of the FN functions and how to use the keyboard.

The bust band was too big (and not adjustable at all, just a band), and the padding in the chest area was lumpy and not in a proper position. There was no way to remove the padding either, so you would have to cut the seam in that area to remove the padding, and I'm not sure if it could be re-sewn easily without knowing how to sew well.

The top barely works for me and I am a size 34dd, if it didn't come with the tank I probably wouldn't wear it at all for that reason. The tank is a little big, but I expected that, and the shorts fit perfectly, I wear a size 6 in pants and am curvy.

The material seems a bit thinner than most suits, but I didn't see it in the sunlight, so I'm not sure about the coverage.\nThe important thing is the fit. Buying clothes online is tough, so I'll be as specific as possible. I am a tiny woman -about a 26 inch waist (0-1 in pants) and a C cup. I got a medium, which says 2-4 US. I'd guess that's the bottoms, and closer to a 2. The bottoms are a bit loose, but just enough to not squeeze anything (probably a similar fit to boxers on a guy.) The top made a stretching/ripping sound when getting it on and off, but once it was on, it covered my boobs well enough.  It's not secure like a sports bra, but I don't feel like I'd fall out if I cannonball. LOL. A small top wouldn't come close to fitting and a small bottom would probably be tight. Their tank top is nice and flows, but the shoulders are tight enough not to fall.\n\nI received this at a discount in exchange for my review.

The elastic at the waist was not flat and would bend in half on the inside of the shorts.  The bra top was super cute with all the straps, BUT was waaaay too small.  If you are a size A bra fit, then it would probably work for you.  This top didn't cover my breasts completely.  It was also padded which I didn't like as it made it feel cheap.  The black top that goes over the bra top was really big and baggy and did not fit at all like the picture.  Overall I was disappointed with the quality of this item (cheap fabric and not made well) and the fact that the fitting was all over the place.

The Wine color is so rich. My purchase of this Elbon Boutique Womens Short Sleeve V-Neck Tunic Top With Handkerchief Hem was made on a whim.  It looked so cute on the model in the picture.  I did not expect it to look good on me or to even be as good as it appeared.  I was so wrong.  The quality is great. The material is lightweight but not really thin. It is not see-thru though pairs well with a cami. There is a small sleeve and a very modest neckline.  I am always looking for tops that are long enough for me and that will not cling to my body. I also need lightweight clothing as I do not do well in the heat.  I am 5'9\" tall and since I wasn't sure of the sizing difference I ordered a 3XL and the length and fit is right. Even if the shirt shrinks up any in the dryer it will still fit well. This shirt is very comfortable and looks great with a pair of jeans or you can accessorize and you're ready for a night out.  With 20 colors to choose from there is a color to go with almost anything.\nI have received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my true and unbiased review.\nI am not connected to this seller and receive no compensation for my reviews.

I was however a little surprised on the color, it said grey but I was expecting a brownish grey like in the picture. But it's a pure grey grey!!! The length is perfect it comes a few inches below the waist line and I wear petites. I am comfortable with that length and doesn't ride up when sitting. The size is way too small, I think the sizes are Asian/ petites. But even for that it seems small. I wear a small/ Medium and still the Large fits really really snug. It does say fitted so perfect description. The stitching and edging are really awesome.\nI would love to see a few more colors in them since they are really good. I don't know how they will be in winter, it says they stay warm in winter and cool in summer. They are really cool right now. I thing they will live up to the expectations since they are bamboo and cotton both of which do good in both climates. Overall I'm very pleased with this Shirt. Would buy more if they are available in more colors since I already have way too many black t-shirts.\nI loved the fact that it has full shoulder coverage which makes it even more versatile and perfect for exercising.
