Having no reviews to help determine sizing and this being a one size fits all type product, I was nervous. But I wanted something new, sexy, & fun for my 36th bday. With Prime, this arrived right on time, for my bday. Let me start with sizing - is it bad to say that I was surprised how well this fit? I am not a tiny person, but I don't consider myself to be overly large either. I am 5'10 with a large frame (meaning I have wide shoulders and wide hips) I weigh right at 165 and wear a size 10-12 depending on the brand. Now, I did not bother even trying on the thong it came with, I have plenty of perfect fitting black panties so there was no need so my review is entirely based off the babydoll. It fit beautifully, I am a 36 C and the lace top hugged the girls quite nicely, not too loose, not too tight. The whole thing has a good bit of stretch to it though It was still loose enough it hung very flatteringly around my midsection & hips. I would guess if you are a size 0, this is going to be loose on you and if you are plus size it would be to small but for someone with at least a B cup and anywhere in the small - large size range, this should fit you. As far a quality, this exceeded my expectations. The lace on the bust and at the bottom looked flawless, no strings or fuzzies, and the body of it in between is just simply a fine mesh. I ordered the black so no surprises on color their. Needless to say, my husband definitely gave this a stamp of approval.\nI did receive this product at a discount for my honest review. I have provided exactly that. Like most women that don't have a perfect body, I wouldn't normally disclose so many personal details but I feel that is vital to get a good understanding on the sizing of this item. I have ordered a lot of lingerie in the past and had pretty much given up due to the onslaught of \"Asian sizing\" or finding that \"one size\" meant size 6 or smaller. It is nice to find something that fit really well without having to be model thin. I will almost certainly order this brand again.", "summary": "Finally, lingerie for real women!!", "unixReviewTime": 1465171200}

I'm 5'3 and 112lbs and this fits me perfectly and drives my boyfriend wild! Mind you, if you are not petite, I would recommend going up a size. It's such a pretty, feminine piece that is subtly sexy at the same time. This is such a universally flattering design that accentuates your cleavage and covers any extra curves in the stomach area. While this piece isn't designed to be for full busted women, its actually a great choice if you want a nice classic chemise and don't mind the lack of internal support. While this won't give you the same lift as your favorite underwire bra, the stretch lace creates enough support to make you feel both lifted and comfortable.\n\nIve had this piece for several days now and found it comfortable enough to sleep in  without falling out the sides or the middle if I roll over at night. The stretch lace panel is also strong enough to hold you in place without your breasts falling through the bottom elastic line, which can be a problem in lesser built pieces. The lace skirt of the chemise is light and comfortable and I just love the black bow below the bust. It draws my boyfriend's attention to my bust and keeps it there. Not only that, it's such a cute and feminine touch. The quality of lace can really vary among brands and this is decent quality for the price. I especially love how breathable the whole thing is. I suspect this will be a staple of my summer sleepwear due to lightness and breathability.\n\nFor full disclosure, I received this item at a discounted price or for free in return for my honest and unbiased review after using the product.

The bag is lined, but it is not the highest quality lining, it is a little crunchy, not as bad as I've ever seen though. I was really surprised about what nice quality the leather was. I was worrried that the bag would be that ground leather if you don't know what i mean, some purse makers take old leather scraps, grind them up and mix it with somekind of glue to make a \"recycled\" leather product that they use to make purses and they call it genuine leather. This is not that, this is nice quality leather. It will fit all of your needs, your cellphone, wallet, make up, brush or combs, a snack, a soda...lol...you get the point, it is roomy but still a nice medium sized bag/purse.

It actually turned out to be pretty big on me, not only in the waist, but the arm holes were also really large and showed the sides of my bra. If I were going to order this again, I would definitely get a medium or maybe even a small. Even though it was too big, I was planning on keeping it, but then I thought that it would make a great gift for the bridal shower I was attending the same day that this package arrived. The girl I gave it to thought it was super cute, and she was really excited about it! Everyone else at the shower also thought it was adorable, so I can definitely say this makes an excellent gift.\n\nThe material that this tank is made from is super soft, and it could easily be worn as a workout tank, pajamas, or just a cute shirt around town. I ordered this tank in the blue color, and the color of the tank in person is the same as what is pictured online. The lettering is also soft, so it doesn't seem like it would crinkle or chip off like iron-on stuff.\n\nI was very happy with this purchase, and I was glad to share this item with my friend and make her happy as well!

I love the color, as it is a coral shade. The fit is athletic yet feminine. It is a T shirt material so it is very comfortable in warm/hot weather. I would be careful folding the lettering side of this shirt as the letters may stick together. I did unfold it and it was sticking a little bit when I got it, however, none of the lettering came off thankfully. I do hang this shirt in my closet rather than folding as I really want to preserve the lettering as much as possible. I also will be hand washing and air drying it too, just to be on the safe side.

It is kind of a hot pink shade.  Still very pretty!  I reviewed that it fit as expected but the only reason it fit as expected is because I actually read the sizing chart and knew to order a few sizes up.  If you're normally a medium you're going to be sadly disappointed if you actually order a medium.  Unless you like your tops skin tight with all your stuff hanging out.  Not the case here - I normally wear a medium and I like my tops to fit a bit loose.  I was looking for a fit similar to the model in the picture and I achieved that by ordering a size XL, as their sizing chart suggested.  It's a super cute tank, seems well made.  It's the perfect material - thin enough to keep you cool but not so thin that it's see through.  I've only tried it on since it was just received today, haven't had a chance to wear it anywhere or wash it but I'm extremely pleased with the initial condition of the top.

Be sure to follow the sizing chart exactly. If your foot is right in the middle of being between two sizes, then I suggest to size up. The sizing from this seller is not what we are used to buying (example size 7, 7.5, 8, so on) just be sure to order your size accordingly.\n\nYou charge the sneakers with the same cord as you would an Android. The shoes come with a dual charging cord. There is not a way to measure battery life though.

The 3 star ruling one out because of how well made, detailed, and beautiful the robe is and that really is this sets saving grace.\n\nI got this because it's well sexy looking and I wanted to surprise the hubby one night after getting the kiddo to bed. In the pics I know the model is skinny and well I am not but it did show the bra looking like it held the girls up decently and the g-string well it actually covers the models nether region. I also loved how the robe looked and the fact that it was lace put this over the top for me.\n\nI got this in the mail and on first inspection it looked like everything was going to be great. I got the xl which is supposed to be for a 14/16 which is what I am though I admit I'm closer to being a 16 though lately I have been able to get into some of my 14's so that means that my start to a healthy lifestyle is starting to pay off whoot whoot. I loved the look of the robe right away and the bra looked sexy but then I got to the g-string.\n\nWhen I first looked at the g-string one of the leg holes was so much bigger than the other that I was very confused by it. I then tried tugging on it a little and I found that the back part of the g-string actually moved so you are able to I guess adjust it to where you need it to be. I'm not sure if its just me but I haven't ever really seen an adjustable pair of underwear before. When I put them on though the fit around the waist was fine it didn't cut into me at all but the triangle piece that covers up my nether bits well didn't really do a great job at all. It was much to small and it made that area down there just look unappealing.\n\nI put on the bra top and was equally disappointed. The part that goes over the neck is just a giant loop that isn't adjustable at all. There is however a tie for around the waist and when tied is secure and doesn't aggravate me by being itchy or anything like that. I wish the neck portion of the top was adjustable because as is it just makes my girls look horrible. All the top is, is just two little triangles that go over the nip area of your girls. The triangles are not very wide and offer basically no coverage. On the pics of the model though she has ample coverage. I guess maybe if your small chested you may have better luck with the top. Also the top offers no support what-so-ever so if your like me and have had a kid and the girls sag a bit this does nothing but make them and you look like those horrible cartoons of grandmas with saggy ta ta's trying to wear sexy bra's for their husbands. When I tried to tie a knot in the loop to help pull the girls up all it did was make them look like they were water balloons being compressed and about to burst. It was just unappealing no matter what I did with it. I will say however that the lace pattern that is on the bra is very pretty and would make it very sexy if it was just better made.\n\nThe robe which I consider to be the main part of this outfit is GORGEOUS I absolutely love it. The lace is amazing it has this nice feel to it and almost has the same quality of rippling silk. I guess I'm trying to say instead of the sometimes rough texture or stark feel that some lace can have this actually feels very nice and is pretty darn awesome. The robe fits perfectly I do not believe it is meant to close even though it comes with a ribbon. In the models picture with hers tied it isn't even really all the way closed. I do want to say the ribbon included is junk though. Its much to short and is basically pointless. The lace design that I love the most on this robe is going down the opening of the robe and on the sleeves. I'm not sure if this is the proper terminology for it but it looks like a scalloped eyelash type design and is just stunning. There were no snags or tears in my robe upon arrival and after wearing it around the house to see if it would snag I didn't have any issues with it.\n\nThe robe is the best thing about this set. I would love it though if they offered a version of it with full length sleeves instead of 3/4 and as full length. I can see this robe being worn as a cover up for a swim suite or as a cover for say a dress with spaghetti straps or tank top style. So not only is it great for being sexy it can also have practical uses. The hem of this ends in just as straight edge I do wish it would have continued the scalloped edging all the way down but it is still beautiful regardless.\n\nI would also like to make note that I felt so uncomfortable and so not sexy in this set that I did not even let my husband see me in it and I threw away everything except for the robe.\n\nI did receive the Queen M lace floral lingerie bath robe set at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review and all opinions expressed above are 100% my own and based off of my personal use and experiences while wearing this set.", "summary": "The robe is GORGEOUS!! everything else is JUNK!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1468972800}

The handles don't go down either they are permanently up. Photos are next to my michael kors bag, the photos actually do the bag justice as it isn't pretty in person at all.

It was such a pleasant surprise really!\n\nCheaply made yes, but there is nothing specific I would change: probably only the borders of the round silicone pieces... it would be nice if they would be cut slightly better - but in the end it is not even a big deal.\n\nI sometimes don't feel like wearing a bra.. but, as we all know, as a woman, no matter how big or small your breasts are, not wearing a bra has ONE big problem: eventually you will see nipple through the shirt. And I personally HATE that! I just don't find it classy and they way I am, I would just feel totally uncomfortable.\nThese nipples come in a box, covered with a plastic part. Take it off and they are ready to be put on! I was surprised how well these are sticking and that they just cover everything that needs to be covered. They are soo soft and light-weight (It's a pleasure to wear these pasties!) and will stay in position for hours and hours... I forgot I had them on after the first 10minutes!!!\n\nGREAT PRODUCT!\nOnce you take them off, just rinse them and let them dry before storing them. And the next time, they are easy to be put on again. LOVELY! They are perfectly under anything you can think of wearing without a bra, thick or thin.. you won't notice anything.\n\nSo simple and so smart. I am soo happy I got the chance to try this product! I think that $11.99 is really a good price for this item. I would definitely buy this again the moment is will start not sticking anymore.\n\nDefinitely recommended!", "summary": "LIGHT! You'll forget you are wearing these! They stick absolutely perfectly and won't fall off. LOVE IT!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1468195200}

Record", "reviewText": "The wait was worth it! I LOVE this shirt! I bought this adorable shirt for my three in a half year old grandson. He has a little bitty body, but a big boy attitude. I ordered a size 2T.  He usually wears an 18 months to 24 months. However, I wanted him to get plenty of wear out of it. Plus it is 100% cotton. The brand is Jumping Beans. It is made of a super soft, breathable cotton. I bought the shirt with the race car design on it. There is embroidery stitching for the flag, number eight, tires, mirrors and the horizontal lines on the grill. The main body of the race car, wheels, grill, and windshield are appliques. In the past I have bought many shirts for my grandson with embroidery on them; several were custom made. Usually the embroidery backing is stiff and uncomfortable on his skin. He has a feeding tube, so needless to say, this can cause big problems. This shirt does have the embroidery backing, but it is not stiff. I have no idea what kind of material this backing is, but it is soft. The embroidery stitching and applique makes it a little stiff, but not rough. So if you have a child that has any kind of sensory issues, this shirt should not be a problem for them.  I could not be happier about my purchase! And I am extremely picky when buying for my grandson! I purchased this shirt at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review of this product. I bought three different styles of shirts similar to this one from the same seller without them being at a discounted price. It was because I loved the shirts so much, that I initially agreed to write a review and receive this shirt at a discounted price. So I can honestly say, I would pay full price for this shirt.", "summary": "Great quality shirt!", "unixReviewTime": 1465776000}

My first impression is the shirt is cute, but a bit larger that expected. The largest size is the equivalent of a size 8 according to the description, but I typically wear a size 10-12 and fit into the shirt great. So if you want a closer fit, I would suggest keeping that in mind. Personally, I love the fit of the shirt bc it's a loose shirt that hints at your curves making it a cool summer shirt (in both ways lol).\n\nThe length of the shirt is great. It comes all the way down and is a full shirt. I think it will go great with shorts or a skirt, or really anything you decide to pair it with. Then shirt was wrinkle when I first received it, but this gave me a chance to see that this shirt is one of those wrinkle free kind of shirts because once I tried it on all the wrinkles pretty much disappeared, so you can shake them right out. Also, the shirt is made of some super soft stretchy cotton like material which is really comfortable and I'm already anticipating wearing this top quite frequently.

It's light and airy but it doesn't feel cheap or like I'm going to rip through it anytime.  The white isn't see-through, which is something that I was somewhat worried about.  The shirt is so so soft and silky.  I have only worn this around the house so far, but I'm sure it's going to be incredibly comfortable to workout in.  I tend to get really overheated when I work out, so having an option this light to work out in, especially on these hot summer days, is going to make it a lot less miserable!\n\nThe material makes this top hang very softly and it's a pretty nice cut.  Not anything I would wear clubbing, but definitely comfortable for lounging and wouldn't get in the way with any kind of working out.\n\nOne thing that I am slightly worried about is the seams on this.  There aren't any loose seams as of right now, but on the inside of the seams the fabric looks like it could fray after a few washes.  If that happens I will update my review, but as of right now there are no noticeable defects which makes this worth the 5 star review!\n\n***Please note that I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

The quality is ok, made of fabric, and it looks same as cute as in the picture. I found the ribbon does not look so pretty, so I placed it facing back instead of front. The hat has a wire inside the outer circle, so you can shape it to whichever shape you want. You can also easily bend it and put it in your bag.\n\nThe hat is a little small in the top, so if your head is larger than average it might feel very tight.

It looks just like the picture. (There's nothing more annoying than opening the box and discovering that the picture looked much different, right?).  The fit is as I expected for a \"one size\" hat, which means that it's slightly tight on my giant head.  The hat did arrive quite wrinkled but a few minutes with the iron fixed that.  I was pleased that there's a significant wire at the brim, so that you can adjust it--that's a problem for me with large brimmed hats that are floppy, cause you can't see out from under the brim.  The fabric is quite thick--like Sunbrella fabric--so I think the claim about SPF protection is probably accurate. This will be my new go-to hat for gardening.\n\nNote that I received a free sample of this item so that I could try it out and leave an honest review.

Apricot would mean an orange shade of some sort, and nope true to the picture there is none (which is a good thing to me). Green? Well that is a bit of a stretch. The top is more black shifting to dark teals, not green. Again this isn't a problem, and is true to the picture.\n\nNow onto the rest, this top is perfect. I am normally a large, and this fit even looser then I thought it would, which is NOT a bad thing at all. It is very very lightweight meaning those hot summer days won't be a problem. The colors are bold and vibrant as well. I happen to have a perfect teal colored tanktop that goes perfect with this, so it is all perfect.\n\nThen why 4 stars you might ask? I didn't notice when I opened the package several loose strings hanging from the top. I shouldn't have to trim my garments before wearing them. This just shows a poor quality check before being packed up.

I believe the price point to be very cheap for the high quality that you are receiving.  As of this review the price was $17.99 for the set with Free Prime Shipping.  I gave the product 5 stars for design, manufacturing and price.  I especially liked that they were Stainless Steel and would not tarnish.\n\n1) Item comes packaged in a white outer packing box which protects the very nice and professional inner black gift box which has the 7th Element embossed on the top in gold foil.  The box is perfect for gift giving and what I would expect from a box containing high end jewelry.  The inside is lined in off white velvet and the Cuff Links are attached to the lid which can be flipped over and placed on top of the box when you are ready to use them.\n\n2) The Cuff Links are Stainless Steel.  The shape is square with the wording My Hero in script written in white on a black background surrounded by a thin Stainless Steel Border.  The back is plain Stainless Steel\n\n3) It is well constructed and easy to use on the proper type of shirt.  They look very nice when worn with a shirt.\n\nEven though I have not used this product over an extended period of time, I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a set of reasonably priced Cuff Links for a gift or even for themselves.  I think it is definitely a unique design.\n\nI received this unit for Free to provide and unbiased review.

Now you do not have to worry about anything else. These are for the skinny ties, which is great because a lot more ties are starting to come out skinny. When it was so hard to find anything skinny and now you can at lease find a little more then you use to. This was the best thing that I have boughten because I do not know how long I have been looking for skinny tie clips then to have a set of three like this, how can you bet this at all. The size is 1.89 inch and material is solid stainless steel. Just love that it has that shine to it that makes you pop out a little bit more then other would. It comes in a nice box that you are able to give it to anyone for a nice gift. To your husband for a birthday, anniversary, or valentines day. You could give it to a friend, co-worker, or anyone at all or even for yourself are great to have.\n\nCompany and Brand Introduction\nHuixin Jewelry is one of the largest jewelry manufacturers in Yiwu and all products carry SGS Product Quality Testing and Certification.

A set of three clips at this width is perfect for anyone who wears ties fairly often and they would also make a great gift. I am able to wear one or more of these tie clips with any tie I own. I can wear these with both skinny and wide ties and they hold just tight enough to keep my tie stable, but not so tight that my tie is damaged. I honestly cannot recommend these enough. Five dollars each for three tie clips is fantastic. With these tie clips, you will be covered for any tie you might have. They even come with a cloth to polish them, which is awesome.\nI did receive these clips at a discount in exchange for an honest review, but I would never allow that to skew my opinion.

Great design as well! The concept of these are very simple and sleek. They don't have any adjustment pins or anything, and it  comes in one piece, so don't worry if anything will break or rip off. What this is is a tight clip, and pretty much when you clip your tie to your shirt, its stays on tight and very nicely .\n\nIt comes in a very nice box, a strong plastic, not like cardboard or anything. On top of the box, it says miraculous garden. You then open it up and see three tie clips, a silver, a black, and a gold one. All three look exactly like the picture, with the same color not washed out. All three of these are tied down with its own case inside. And also within the box is a microfiber cloth for the tie clips. Mine came in perfect condition with no scrathes, dents, or missalignment. The clips are very tight and im pretty sure these will never lose the tightness. They will for sure stay on your stuff with ease andwont damage anything. These have so much sleek to them that they need their own cloth to wipe it down for fingerprints! I reccommend this to anyone who wants to come out in style and look at their best in any attire.

I wish I could give it five stars, but the writing on it doesn't make sense.  Though I think the wonky English is cute, I really don't think it's supposed to read that way in English--rather, we're experiencing translation issues.  The front of the wallet (as you can see in the photos below) has a little umbrella on the right side and the script in the middle reads, \"Waiting for the rain, the life is an umbrella\".  I'm not sure if the wallet is genuine leather either (I suspect not, though it states that it is in the instructions and in the listing).  The cleaning instructions were also the result of a bizarre translation from Chinese to English.\nWhat I like about it:  It is very cleverly designed. As you can see in the below photos, it has two separate, clear ID pouches and credit/business card slots.  It fits American and foreign currency equally well in the cash area, and the coin pouch is large and has secure snaps.  My only complaint (other than the grammar issue) is that the wallet is a little bulky and difficult to fasten once it's full.  However, I think once it is \"broken in\" a bit, it will be easier to close.\nNOTE:  I received the product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.\nBOTTOM LINE:  I think it's a really cute, very functional wallet.  If you think that off-English quotes are funny, this is definitely a worthwhile purchase.  It comes in lots of great colors and I found the online picture to be true to the actual color when it arrived, which is always nice.  I think $5-$10 is a more reasonable price since the wallet has its quirks, but $13 is not expensive and it seems to be very sturdily constructed.

I found that stockings were far more comfortable and convenient than pantyhose would ever be, in my opinion, and I loved how most of them had a silicone top to keep them from falling down or from needing a garter.\n\nThe one I chose, beige, had that beloved silicone on top, which kept me swooning. I loved the beautiful lacey design on the top, and, if I didn't know better, I would think these were pretty expensive, as they definitely look like it. These stockings also had a bit of a shimmer to them. It wasn't extremely over the top, but if you are looking for a matte pair of beige stockings, these are not the ones.\n\nWhen purchasing stockings, I always buy one size up, if possible, as runs are and will be the death of me. I'm 5'3\" and 112 lbs, and I ordered the \"Queen\" size. They came up pretty high on my thighs, about 2/3 of the way up. As expected, they were a bit looser on me than usual, but that wasn't an issue, as it was not baggy or wrinkly looking, and it was better than being afraid to move, in fear of getting runs. Also, my getting a larger size prevented the stockings from choking my thighs!\n\nAlso, I noticed that the toe area of the stockings was just the slightest bit thicker, most likely to prevent rips from toenails. My toenails aren't long or gnarly or anything, but I did find this helpful.\n\nOverall, I had no issues with these stockings. They stayed up well, had a slight shimmer to them, and were the perfect color. The intricate design was a beautiful touch, and I would recommend going a size up, if possible, unless you are pretty petite.\n\nI received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.\n\n[...]", "summary": "I love them!

Shipping was much faster than estimated time as promised. I wear a size medium normally so I ordered a large. It's beautiful on. It is extremely sheer but as it clearly shows that on the model picture I was expecting it. I used a black dress slip underneath and that worked well. What takes me from loving it to liking it however, is there are pleats across the breast area right under the crochet, making my breasts look much larger than they are and not in an attractive way. I couldn't tell the pleats were there in the pictures and there was no mention in the product description. If you've ever worn pleated pants you know what that looks like, so imagine it across the chest. Smaller chested woman would probably get the fit seen on the model but if you are average or above expect it to look a bit different. Otherwise, great product and great seller.

The material is really great quality and comfortable. There is a pocket in the front on each side but no pockets in the back.\n\nI purchased these for my Mom, even though, she was iffy on if she'd like them or not because she isn't one for capris & the photos made it seem like they would be. They ended up fitting her like regular pants because she is 5'2, so she loves the pants now. She ranges between a size 10-12 so I ordered her a size Large (12). The waist fits her just fine, a little bigger but that's better than being too tight, but the length differs due to her height I'm guessing, so know that in advance if you're planning on getting these as capris. I held them up to me and they come to right above my ankles, not as far up as capris would be, and I am 5'8\" 1/2.\n\nShe likes that she can wear them to work but that they're also comfortable enough to wear on her days off if she needs to run errands. She's already gotten compliments on them from her friend and her sister. No problems with washing them- they came out just fine.\nI can definitely recommend these pants but would most likely assume they're going to fit you more like regular pants instead of capris as shown in the photos. Judging from how great the material is, how nice these pants look and how happy she is with them, I'm giving them 5 stars.

I bought these because I was looking for a pair of black pants at the mall and could not find any that fit well. I think the reason these fit so well is they are well designed and well made. They also have some elastic in the waist band that flexes, and the tag on the pants says 96% Polyester, 4% Spandex, which means they have a little stretch (though not quite as much as I would have expected, so you won't want to order too much on the small side--they are not like jeggings). I also like that they will be machine washable and won't wrinkle (I'm assuming this, anyway, and will update this post if there are any surprises). I love how these pants give shape to an ensemble and are so versatile. I will be able to wear them to work or for a night out or just around the house--any occasion, matching nearly any tops I have. I also tried them on with a wide range of shoes and found that for me, at least, I needed some height and elegance with them, so I went with a little strappy heel. I received these pants at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review, and I honestly LOVE them.\n\nSIZING: To give you an idea of size, I am 5'6\" and you can see in the photos where the length falls. I purchased size \"Medium,\" and my measurements are 40-30-37.  I think they fit very well. I was \"in between sizes,\" so I didn't know whether to order up or down. If you have the same situation, order for the look you want--if you want a baggier look, I would go larger; if you want a sleek look, I would skew smaller.

You know if your girls want your clothes you must be in style. I only wish they sold this shirt when I was there age.\n\nI recommend this shirt for any age. It is stylish well made and comfortable.

It was a distraction for my husband that's all he talked about all night.., my kids call and ask if I'm wearing my ' Cougar Shirt and make roaring noises on the phone'\n\nDisclosure  I received a discount in exchange for my review of this first Black shirt.

Actually, I seriously considered keeping them for myself for a minute there, but I knew that my mom would really love them, so I settled on buying a second set for myself instead. :D The earrings are very tiny if that helps at all, I was worried that they would be too big. Buy them, you won't regret it!\n\nIf my pictures or review helped in anyway, please click the Helpful or Yes button below!

I've never had that happen before.  They were literally several inches shorter than my current boots.  So they got returned.\n\nHowever, while in my possession, I noticed a few things.  The memory foam cushion looked to be really comfortable, but didn't expand all the way out to the sides of the insole.  Maybe their thought was the foot is rounded and wouldn't come into contact with the corners, but it seemed odd to me.  The outside material and the sole looked to be really nice.  But the one thing that would have made me return these if they did fit - the zipper is actually on the OUTSIDE of the boot.  I've never seen a moto-style boot with an outer zipper, as, well, you don't put on your shoes like that, nor do your legs bend in that direction.

Even that is a tad small. Shame, because I really like it. Other than the fact it has awesome graphics, the quality is really good. I gave it only three stars because of the sizing. I wish they had it in XXX-L.\n\nEdit: Since last posting this review, I have been in contact with the seller. They have been really nice about this whole issue regarding sizing. It's definitely not their fault, it's just boils down to the fact that it is Asian sizing. I had approached them thinking that perhaps my shirt was labeled/marked wrong, but it isn't. They were kind enough to offer a refund, but I decided to keep the jersey as a Tour de France collectable. Also, it is helping to motivate me in losing weight considering how tight it fit. Yep, I have to get rid of that small basketball in my stomach. :-)\n\nA further edit: The seller, Avengers Outdoors, has been so very gracious in dealing with me. Every time I contact them, they respond right away. As much as they couldn't find a shirt that would fit me, they refunded my money and told me to keep the shirt. How nice it would be if all companies treated their customers with the kindness and respect that Avengers Outdoors showed me. Bare in mind again, that the three star rating is only due to the sizing issue, and not the seller. I give full marks to the seller, and look forward to dealing with them again if a product I need in the future is one that they sell.", "summary": "Awesome, but sizing is way off!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1479600000}

I've been faithful to 2XU because of the fit, cut and length. They have been a perfect pair of compression. I bought these because of color scheme and reviews.\nAnd the reviews basically, I'm convinced, have no idea how COMPRESSION works.\nThese Defender *LEGGINGS* have zero compression factor into them. I ordered a small thinking they would hug my leg muscles. Here is the problem with these.\n2XU is a thick, tight material that actually feels more than tight against the muscles, which is how compression works. Compression against the muscles to reduce vibration and improve blood flow for recovery. Defender tights DO NOT DO THIS. They are a super thin, borderline see-through fabric. The stitching is irritating as since it's not actually skin tight, it shifts, and the big middle stitching rubs on your leg. Never had a problem with 2XU's tights doing this.\nThe other problem I have with these is JHC, what is with the excessive high rise waist? Were these made for a mutant with the worlds longest torso? I had to fold the waist band over itself otherwise the waistband becomes a corset it's so high up. And the length is excessive as well.\nI ordered a small. I'm 5'7, 165 with muscular legs. These have ZERO compression qualities, they're too long, the waist band is way too high. I guess you get what you pay for.  Spend money and get 2XU.

I find that everyone's size small is not the same but at most stores or even internet clothing sites, you can at least run error on the side of caution that you can give or take a few inches. I love it when sites list actual measurements because let's face it, you are cutting fabric to a certain dimension to give it a size. Sounds simple!\n\nNot so simple when the measurements do not match the article of clothing. Let me start by saying I range between a size small in some brands and medium in others. My chest is usually what makes me go up on size because I dislike that feeling of sleeves being pulled if a shirt is too tight in the front. In comes Milumia that thankfully lists the measurements in centimeters, but gives the shopper an idea of sizing. Dresses are a safe bet because you don't usually have to worry about waist and hip sizes with certain styles and especially those worn in Summer. I wanted dresses that have a light fabric, so these being 100% rayon allowed the fabric to remain light and breathable.\n\nNow, to the second dress I ordered from Milumia. I ordered size small and it was still too baggy on the bottom but nowhere near as the white one I reviewed first. Extra small was available but at 33.1 inches, this left no room for error as I am about 33 inches around the chest and a C cup. The dress featured is a light soft pink in color (in the picture) with a paler pink where the crochet style lays, giving it a nice contrast. You have a beautiful flutter of fabric that rests just below the shoulder and it gives the dress a very fun and just perfect for Summer look! You also have a pearled-like pink button that allows you to have an open or closed \"key-hole\" at the chest.\n\nWhen I received the dress, the dress is not at all as soft \"pink\" as pictured. At the time I wanted the coffee color but it was not stocked in my size. I went with the pink as the second choice. I notice now Salmon is available and that reflects an even paler color than the pink I received. I can easily say the pink fabric does not reflect in hue to the one pictured and it seems like names of colors are being used freely without really knowing what hue they reflect. Furthermore, that contrast in the picture on Amazon where the lace lays......well, it's not there. The pink on the crotchet is as deep in pink as the rest of the dress. The cut is also a little odd. The torso is not as long as it should be, making this dress almost have a doll like cut. I'm short at 5'3 and the torso just did not set well when I wore it. The waist is high but because it is not fit to your body, you lose any curvature you may have and it just looks like a child's dress even though the skirt part is long enough. Very unusual. I have worn high waist dresses and because the cut in sizing was accurate, the dress rested beautifully.  Again, the sizing does not correspond with the one listed. This dress on the \"waist\" and top are way too baggy. I mean inches here in sizing being off, not centimeters. You will also note that there is discrepancies in sizing by color choice. Yes, Milumia has different dimensions for sizes that go by the color you choose. I have never seen this before. I can sometimes see where one color of fabric is sewn in one factory and another at a different location and you may have a few discrepancies by centimeters, but you have differences in inches here! So before you order, make sure to look and even then like the size small, pink dress I received; the color is wrong (and it goes beyond computer settings), the contrast in fabrics is not there and the seamstress did not even go by the graph present for the color/size. This dress retails for $19.99 and I could see it as a bargain if the sizing was respected and even the contrast in fabric was like the picture. A dress that is just too big and does not represent the sizing listed just makes it a draw of luck. Will the dress you get be the size stated? Who knows! Due to the color being as it is, I will not be trying to fix this one. I may try to wash it and see if it shrinks but then it could be shorter and not something I desire when the bottom is baggy (not airy).\n\nI received the above product(s) free of charge from Milumia. I am not obligated to provide a positive or favorable review, just my honest opinion. I received no other compensation in exchange for my review. My review is based on my experience with the product and/or brand, which may differ from yours.", "summary": "Milumia: Summer Dress with a Lace/Crotchet waist in Pink Review", "unixReviewTime": 1469059200}

The belt really stays put. And when you need to slip out for the expected mess making, no problems either. The nylon does not feel as rigid as other nylon products, but wear and tear is dependent on the user not the product. Where I will deduct 1 star is the elastic retainer. When the excess after buckling the belt is going to either fit in the belt loop (on the pants) the elastic retainer will need to move passed that, which means removing the belt from the pants risks dropping the elastic retainer. If an elastic retainer is provided for the purpose of doing an inspection roll, then it is in the wrong side, because the normal setup for an inspection is the buckle is placed horizontally on a vertically rolled belt, or on the outside for a riggers belt. I'm a normal 34 inch waist, but I got a 44 inch belt, I usually run the excess of 10 inches thru the belt loops, which is easy to manage. I don't claim to be an expert with military belts, but I don't recall using or needing an elastic retainer, but I am very happy with this 1 week under my belt.", "summary": "Normal Daily Wear No Problems", "unixReviewTime": 1474848000}

Although it said it would take a month to ship (apparently coming fresh off the boat from Asia), it arrived in a few weeks instead.\n\nConstruction: Very well made; it doesn't seem as if it will fall apart like my last purse. The hardware is strong, the zippers are good quality, and the leather is thick. The inside liner is cute; it seems to be some kind of a print. The inside liner is a little crinkly, which is strange but not a dealbreaker by any means. Overall, the construction is top notch.\n\nStyle: Love the style; it has three sections with a few extra zippered pockets so you can organize everything and not have it get lost. There are thick short handles as well as a strap, which is what I prefer. Again, the strap is well-made and strong.\n\nColor: My purse is a little lighter than the picture showed for Bordeaux Red, more like a light mauve than a dark mauve. Still pretty coloring and detailing.\n\nSmell: When a leather item comes straight off the production line and goes into shipping, it can sometimes take on a certain smell, but a day or two of airing it out should solve the problem. I put mine out on the porch for a few hours, wiped it down with leather wipes, and sprayed a little febreeze in the liner and the smell is gone. Again, compared to how well-made this purse is and how cute it is, the initial smell from production is not a dealbreaker by any means.\n\nOverall: I paid $30 for my last non-leather purse, which fell apart in a few months.

It looks identical to the listing so you can expect to receive what you see. I also posted several pictures so you can see what it looks like off the model in product listing. I received this set complimentary in order to try on and provide honest consumer feedback and below I'll provide all my thoughts. Also, just to point out, this outfit can be worn in several different ways which I LOVE. As you can see from my photos, I not only demonstrated what it looks like worn together, but I also paired the skirt up with my own top, paired the halter up with some cut off shorts, and I even wore the skirt as dress!\n\n***Sizing/Fit****\n\nFor reference, I am 4'10-4'11 ish and about 90ish or so pounds. My bust size is slightly larger at 34D/32DD. My waist size is about 24 to 25 depending on the brand. In US sizes I typically order a size XS or S. Being as though small was the only size offered on here, I went with that option. The halter top fit great, but slightly longer on me than on the model as my torso is shorter. The skirt was good lengthwise, but somewhat baggy in the waist. I was able to take the skirt in a few inches and it's absolutely perfect now! The assymetrical cut and style is adorable and will make short legs look long and long legs look longer. The skirt is a spandex material so has some stretch to it making it good for those without a booty and muscular build, but also good for those with a booty and muscular build. My best suggestion is to stick with your normal size. Most definitely do not size up, unless you are okay with altering the skirt a bit. I can honestly say though, this set is worth doing the altering for because it's THAT cute.\n\n***Material and Comfort Factor****\n\nThis outfit gets two thumbs up for comfort factor. The skirt is so soft that I could live in it! The halter is all lace and will look cute tucked in or worn untucked (if your torso is short and it cannot be worn as a halter). You can get away with no bra although there isn't much support in the breast area. Stick on adhesives would work well too if you feel you need the support.\n\nThis set can be dressed up or down. It would look great for the daytime with a pair of wedges or sandals. It will also transition well into the evening when paired with stilettos.\n\nOverall, I think this set is a great buy! The quality of the skirt is A++ in my opinion and halter an A. I see myself wearing this set a lot both together and as individual pieces. If you are on the fence, don't be. You won't be disappointed!", "summary": "Can be worn multiple ways!", "unixReviewTime": 1471651200}

Bluntly, my boobs look fantastic in this top. This photo makes it look so modost. I know everybody is different but for me, this is a crazy good boob shirt.

Be sure to pay attention to the Asian sizing, I'm usually a 3x bottom and 4x top so I ordered a 10x and it fits perfect. The bra has cups and is supportive.

Not only is this purse incredibly cute, but it's extremely well made. The stitching, the straps, the fabric, the zipper.....  this is one sturdy purse. I'm not going to lie, I am very hard on purses, and I really put them to the test. I feel very confident that this one is going to last me for sometime. I picked out the Bee style because I'm a beekeeper and it's so cute. You're not going to fit much in the zipper pouch behind the bee, but it's a cute embellishment nonetheless.

I was hopeful that these would be able to help keep my skin covered on sunny days without overheating me, and in theory, they do exactly that. However, they do run very small, and even though I sized up as suggested, they are very short in the waist (I'm 5'8\") and just look really boxy and unattractive on me. It doesn't look nice and lean like in the photos; in order to get that sort of appearance of length, you need to order much larger...but then it looks too boxy and wide. No matter what size you order, it's very short in the torso.\n\nI haven't ended up wearing these out much at all because of the short length and boxy appearance. It would work nicely for shorter gals, but be sure to size up since it's not stretchy, forgiving fabric. I really love the idea of this over-shirt, but not the execution/cut.

In these pics, I was wearing an unpadded and unlined lacy day bra under the top. I usually wear more substantial bras sand, when I do, I fill out the hoodie so the Medium would have strained against my chest. The hoodie falls to just below hip length and is very pretty.

But if you want a light, sheer shirt with a hood and pockets, you may like this one. I do. The color is true to the picture (I got Spearmint.) and it won't shrink because it is partially polyester. The material is soft and the top is comfy. Size up and you'll enjoy this sheer hoodie!\n\nI received a discount (about half off) on the price of this hoodie in exchange for my honest review.

The \"strappy\" sides give the suit a really nice sex appeal and the pops of color actually look better in person than the pictures online.  I was nervous about the fit and the quality of the suit, but was definitely pleasantly surprised- this is a legit bathing suit, not \"cheapy\" material.  Another thing that appealed to me, personally, was how high the back of the swimsuit comes up.  My sister, unlike myself, has a great back, if that makes sense- I mean to say, she does not have any unsightly side rolls or \"backfat\" so while this is not important for her, for me it is the icing on the cake.

As such, our kids are usually packing something to keep themselves entertained while on the road.  Our youngest had been complaining for a bit her backpack was too big for what she usually brought along.  So, when I was offered to review this backpack, I thought it might be what she was looking for.\n\nThe daypack (backpack?) came nicely packaged.  The daypack looks darker in person versus what the pictures in the listing show  I presume it is because of lighting.  The canvas part of the daypack feels like what you would expect canvas to feel like.  I was very surprised at how nice the leather felt; it does not feel cheap.  The zippers feel pretty durable, but she does whish the pull tabs had a bit of texture to them versus being smooth.  The main pocket is one big pocket, and can really hold quite a bit.  The front pocket is smaller, and is perfect for items such as headphones and chargers.  There are two open side pockets which are too small in width to hold most of todays cell phones.  For the most part she uses those pockets for snacks or tissues.\n\nBesides the pull tabs, the only other complaint she has is the strap can be uncomfortable if there is enough weight in the daypack.  Personally, I think this is an indication she is putting too much in it, but what do I know?\n\nIn the end, she loves this daypack, and has been using it regularly for the last couple of months.  Based upon how much she likes it, I see no reason not to give it 5-stars.  It still looks really good  even after being used heavily.  Hopefully, it will last for a long time.\n\nI was provided this product to provide an unbiased and thorough review.  As I rely on the reviews others leave on Amazon, I hope to provide complete reviews as well.

The v-neck design is very flattering and works well for a small chested girl like me as it shows off some cleavage while providing modesty. The halter neck straps can be tied for a tighter or looser fit as desired.\n\nNote that I don't think this swimsuit would support girls with bigger boobs as there is literally no support - the sides of the swimsuit cut straight down to meet the low cut bottoms and so there are no sides to support or hold bigger boobs in place.\n\nThe cut outs are nice but a little scratchy, hopefully after getting into the pool this won't be an issue. I wouldn't actually mind a swimsuit with no cut-outs at all, just a plain design, as I'm worried a snag will rip the cut-outs and render the swimsuit unwearable.

This shirt does not have that length, in fact the bottom half of the shirt is shorter than the top part and barely reaches the top of my pants.\n\nAnother weird thing about the sleeves is that the little elastic area round the wrist isn't even elastic. It's cinched up, but it's REALLY wide. Like, almost a belled sleeve. It's awful. Also, I ordered a size 8, but the tag doesn't say 8, it says XL. That's fine since sizes may be relatable, but I don't think the sizing information is accurate. This is definitely bigger than a size 8 in the bust (and I did use measurement in the ad to determine the size to buy) and in the bottom of the sleeves, but much smaller than an 8 in length and in the upper sleeves.

Being a thicker girl there are times especially if I am somewhere that has a lot of people that I don't feel comfortable being in my bathing suit cause of looky loos and being a little self-conscious about the extra pounds that I carry around with me.\n\n  First thing is first, now I know that I am a bigger girl and that my suits run a little bigger but to be able to get a suit that fit me I had to get a 7X.I usually wear a XL, now I know that this is a different sizing measurement but that already made me sad and made my heart hurt. Once I got over the fact that I had to order such a bigger size everything else was great. One of the things that I have a harder time with when it comes to nothing suits is the mid-section. Bathing suits are made to be worn tight so I am usually wearing a towel or shorts to cover up that larger portion of my body. This suit that wasn't needed, with the mesh like material that is on the suit it covers enough of my mid-section that I feel comfortable enough that I can go without a cover-up. Another problem that I have with bathing suits is that I have a shorter torso so some bathing suits seem a little large when it comes to length, this suit seemed to be almost perfect in that area. The straps of the suit didn't fall off nor did they dig into my shoulders making it uncomfortable (the last thing I want to do is be uncomfortable when I am trying to relax.) Being a bigger chested girl I always worry about how the cups of bathing suits will fit me. The cups fit perfectly and didn't cut the circulation off to the girls all while still supporting them. The cut of this bathing suit is great cause the bottom portion of the bathing suit looks like a pair of boy shorts, this is great for someone like me that wants that bigger portion of her body to be nice and covered.\n\n  I really do enjoy this bathing suit. The way that the bathing suit is built almost can be mistaken for a shorter dress. If you are one that wants to be a little bit more covered up while still having a good time in or by the water, then this would be perfect. The suit does great in the water and dries as quickly as all the other bathing suits that I have tried on. I like that all the important parts are covered up while still letting me enjoy the good times. This would be great for anyone that is a little more conservative at the beach like me.\n\n  Ireceivedthis product for free in exchange for my true and unbiased opinion.

I've been babysitting her since she was a baby!\n\nI always tell her \"I love you to the moon and back!\" so this special pendant and chain set was PERFECT for her!  I was a little concerned that the chain would be too long for a child, but it's just right for her!\n\nI brought her a stuffed animal set and this necklace and told her to just wear it for special occasions, not to play in. She wore it on her birthday and to church twice. She also wore it when I took her and her big sister out to lunch at a \"fancy restaurant\" in town. I had to post a pic of her sweet face so you can see the love. She's precious!  I'm really happy with the quality of this necklace! It just sparkles!\n\nPros:\n1) The quality is outstanding! Solid .925 Sterling silver (should not tarnish!) Gorgeous white and yellow gold plating.\n2) I love the moon and stars design and silver/gold (you can wear it on either side)\n3) Clasp is quality made! I prefer a spring-ring style like this.\n4) The box chain is 18\" long and SO much better than typical chains that come with pendants.\n5) The sparkly box is adorable! VERY nice gift quality design. It's a nice touch to have a fancy box for gift giving and for storing the jewelry. Danyale stores her necklace in the box every night.\n6) Allergy prevention: I am VERY sensitive and cannot wear cheap quality jewelry. Since it irritates my skin, I wanted something safe for this sweet girl.\n7) Comes with a polishing fabric to keep the pendant shiny (and wipe the chain after wearing for cleaning).\n\nCons:\nI cannot think of any suggestions for improvement. This is a beautiful necklace!\n\nI was very happy to receive this beautiful pendant and chain at no cost in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I'll post pics! :)", "summary": "Gorgeous silver and gold plated pendant and chain! I love the moon and stars design! Such a special gift :)", "unixReviewTime": 1470182400}

She is a skinny little thing so the bathing suit sags but the elastic keeps it in place on her hips where it belongs.

I love love love it!  I have some really cute shorts that are blue and white vertical stripes that are very thin stripes. They will look really cute with a blue anchor tank top I thought. I found some sailing looking loafer shoes that matched perfectly. The only thing I needed was the tank top to complete the look. I saw this blue anchor tank top and had to have it. I worried that it would be short and croppy and I am long waisted. Usually things are too short for me. I love this top so much it is nice and long and fits me perfectly. I prefer to buy my clothes at boutiques because I like soft classy clothes. I always say that I would rather have one thing I love than 10 things that I kinda like and that I do not really want to wear. Well this is a nice inexpensive top and is so soft and the same high quality material that I get at expensive boutiques. If I got this at a boutique for regular price, it would easily be twenty to twenty five dollars. We are going on a beach vacation this month and the shipping date on this item said it might not be in until next month which I thought was disappointing. When I got it in really early that was just a huge surprise. I get to take it on my trip! yay! Ok now I love this top, there is no doubt about it at all. I do not like the bow in the back very much though. It is floppy and I will likely just take it off if I can with out ruining the shirt. It is not hideous totally but it is a little childish and since I am twenty nine years old, I do not want to keep it on and I think it is uncomfortable when sitting back in a chair. It is almost like there is a lump there pressing in to my back. As much as I do not like the bow, I love the top so much I could not take a star off. It is so comfortable I actually got giddy when I tried it on.\n\nI received this item at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.

I'm very modest and when I go to the membership pool I wear a cover-up between the shower and pool and back again. I didn't realize that it had an inside liner until I put it on. I have a large bust and it fits me ok but the liner is a little tough to pull down, especially when I'm wet. Plus the arm holes are pretty small. A reviewer mentioned a front a back and at least on the one I got the liner is the same length on both sides so it could be put on either way.\n\nAt first I was planning on cutting out the liner so it would be easier to get on and off, but I'm still debating that. After I get out of the pool and shower I put this on and it's now a blouse. I kind of like the look and if I took the liner out I would not wear it as a blouse; it's very see through (hence the liner).\n\nThe one is have is called pink, I don't know why because the only pink in it is a flower; it's definitely orange (4 1/2 stars). I do like it as both a cover-up and as a blouse.\n\n{Sample provided for review}", "summary": "Cover-up and blouse", "unixReviewTime": 1465689600}

Yes, I realize how weird that sounds- but I got the pink one, and the liner isn't substantial enough to prevent bra show through EXCEPT, if you put it on backwards the floral pattern is on top, and does sufficiently obscure the bra.  IMO, its cuter that way too.  I first put it on backwards by mistake.  I liked it but was thinking, the print isn't going to be the same as you saw on the website (floral on bottom).  That is when I realized I had it on backwards (oops) and flipped it around.  Ok now it's just like online, but I don't like it as much because I have to be way more careful about what I put on under it.\n\nBeing polyester, despite its very thin wispy nature, it seems to retain heat.  It's not as cool as a normal tank top, temperature wise.\n\nHonestly, there isn't really a difference in shape front to back that I can tell, and I'll probably just wear it backwards!  I still wouldn't have given it a 5, because the liner isn't nearly as long as it should be in my opinion.  I don't like the early end leaving part see through, I know it's a fashion choice, but I just don't like it.  I think it would look prettier if more consistent throughout the length.  Like most clothes in this price range and especially of this cloth type, I worry about durability.  Hand wash or get a very fine mesh lingerie bag for best results.\n\nNow on size- I think I'm a little smaller than the target market for this shirt (description says Medium to Large, I'm a size 4, 32C) but it fits me OK, it's not way too big but it is a little wide on the torso, a hair wider than the style is designed to be.\n\nNow realistically, I worry for anyone with thick arms that this will be a bad choice.  I have very thin arms and have about an inch and a half or two to spare and there isn't really any give to them.  No stretch, either it'll fit comfortably or it won't at all.  I see another reviewer, size 16 mentioned she liked the fit but in her photos you can see she's not utilizing the arm holes.  I don't know if that was just that she didn't realize they were there or it did not fit comfortably, it's not addressed in her review.\n\nJust a heads up, because I also didn't notice them when I first put it on and there is a secondary area that feels like appropriate arm holes, The higher hole doesn't line up with the liner tank top so its easy to overlook when you put it on.  I was going to complain that the beautiful draping is actually in the way of getting anything done.  If you don't use the arm holes and use this secondary area, the shirt drapes over your hands, making cooking or eating in this shirt near impossible, not to mention you'd have a hell of a time in the restroom!  You want those higher arm holes to work for you unless you intend to stand pretty still all day.  Also, unless you are a sewing guru, it's going to look a little odd to have two stitched holes at about the height of your elbow just hanging out.\n\nI received a sample in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.", "summary": "Size/armholes/see-through", "unixReviewTime": 1465689600}

I went to a movie with some friends and was able to carry my wallet, cell phone, winter hat, small umbrella, water bottle, and a dozen cookies in it!

The mesh bag is a good idea to keep the sleeves from stinking. I bought the black with the logo on the top, understated but strong looking. I used the sizing chart and was at the top end of the XL range. This is what I ordered and the fit is snug, not too slim where one has to risk tearing the seams to pull them up over the knee but snug enough to give the anticipated support. I have used the sleeves in both metcons (many wallballs, burpees and front lunges) and in heavy lifting sessions (cleans, squats, more squats) and have been impressed with their performance in both. In a full squat under weight I feel the support of the 7mm thickness and in a WOD they don't distract me by falling down. I have used other products that bunch up, pinch and wear out after a few months of heavy use. I need more time with them to see if they stand the test of time but no pinching and no bunching and that is a huge plus.\n\nFull disclosure: I did receive a discount for my review but now that I have them I feel they are worth the full price.

As I got older and figured out that no one gets out of their 20's or their 30's alive I know I needed something to save my knees.

I had bought the other one because it was endorsed by a big name crossfitter and according to him it was the best thing and the best company.  Understanding now that is their job as much as it is and they get paid to say that they say.  Yes, they may love the products but at the end of the day, they get a pay check from that product.  So moving past that on to Wodbottom.  Firs,t as I have reviewed before one of the best fitness supply companies out there.  I have never had a bad experience with this company.  They are professional and personable they are a company that you can trust to be honest and help their customers out.\n\nOn to the sleeves, the biggest problem I had with my other sleeve is that it would not stay up and would tend to bunch up.  It would be that in the middle of a wod or lifting I would have to stop and readdress my sleeve.  I am not competitive by nature so that extra few seconds was not that big of a deal, however, it would get annoying.  I have used my Wodbottom many times and found they do not creep down or bunch up like my other ones did.  They fit perfect and give the support needed.  I just finished up training and running a marathon so my knees are not all that happy with me right now.  I had lifted once without my sleeves trying to work through a heavy squat complex and it did not go well.  My knee the rest of the day was on fire.  Yesterday I went through a rough wod with a good number of squat cleans and then did one round of a hero wod with 25 Back Squats at 185 needless to say the rest of the day the one that did not hurt was my knee.

It might work very nicely for a runner, but I wanted a compression shirt for a workout involving weights and varied upper body exercises. It is sufficiently tight around the bust, but flares outward below the waist and is not very long, so every time I raise my arms the shirt goes up too. I constantly have to pull it down, but I don't want to drop the weights and interrupt repetitions to do that, so until I can pull the shirt down, it is very uncomfortable. Very disappointing. I decided to try my husband's neleus compression shirts for men. They are considerably longer and tighter below the waist and have a lot more room in the shoulders than the female cut, as they are designed for the male frame. I have an hourglass shape but I find the male cut much more comfortable because it allows for a lot of varied arm movement and the shirt stays snug at the hips so it does not ride up during my workout.

I was wary about buying a purse online; for me, that's the kind of thing I feel I need to see in person. But this bag ended up being perfect! Lots of room for larger items and a long strap for carrying as a cross-body. It holds its shape well - it is not some big shapeless mess that makes it difficult to find loose items, yet it is not too rigid. The material is comfortable against the body and is holding up well. The charcoal color, in my opinion, is true to picture.\n\nSome information you may not be able to tell from the picture:\n\n1. The outer left pocket (facing the photo) is not really a pocket; YES, it is a zipper pocket (you can see how the zipper moves along the top of the pocket), and the flap on it velcros closed, but the flap is for decoration only. The flap does not hide a pocket.\n2. The outer right facing pocket next to it, with the metal ring and black canvas detail, is an actual pocket that closes via velcro. This velcro is not great on this pocket, but I have been able to keep my phone there with no problems.\n\nThis purse would be excellent for moms who don't carry a diaper bag but still need to carry some items every day; for students who carry tablets around campus; for anyone looking for a smaller messenger bag; for anyone looking for a purse that has the messenger bag feel and can haul a good number of items.", "summary": "Excellent purse!", "unixReviewTime": 1500681600}

Thought I would try out this suit.  I liked the way it looked like you have a 2 peice on, but the top looks like you have a tank over your suit.  Got the suit and tried it on. I got a US size 16.  The top fit fine , except that the straps are too long even if you adjust them for me.  So in order for me to wear this I would have to re-sew the straps tighter.  The bottom is definitely a bikini bottom and is more suited for a slimmer body.  I would have preferred to have  better coverage on the bottom.  It is made out of what feels like a good quality swimsuit material.  The Suit itself is black, with a black and white stripe look 2 pc underneath.  I love the look of this suit.  I am going to keep it and re-sew the top straps to fit me and I will change out the bottoms for a fuller bottom in black that I already have.  A couple of changes in the making of this suit and a fuller sized women would just love it,  but I am sure a slimmer women would look fantastic in it.\nI received this at a discounted rate for product testing and review.

It does run small so be sure you size up. It looks exactly like the photo. I am usually a 1x with 44f boobs and I ordered the 3x. The top is fine.

However, I like my legs so I'm ok with that. You can easily replace with more coverage if you need. The bottoms are tied on the sides so you can size up or down a few inches.

The LEDs surround the bottom of the entire shoe and can change color, as well as, two flash modes with a button attached to the micro USB port. These do come with a micro USB for charging. Charging time, if the shoes are completely dead, is about 3 hours and LEDs can be used for about 7-8 hours. These shoes are not flexible and do not have arch support. These are flat shoes, like any of the skateboard brand shoes, but not as light-weight. These are not heavy shoes and my son who is 7 hasn't had issues walking in them. I was surprised that the soft fabric goes throughout the inside when many shoes stop the fabric lining after the shoe's tongue ends. My son generally wears them from morning until mid-afternoon. He hasn't complained of any pressure or sore areas on his feet. I've looked his feet over without seeing any irritation.\n\nThe micro USB port for charging is covered with material and is right above my son's ankle. He says he doesn't notice the port at all, but because of the port's location he often presses the button and changes the color. Personally, I like the mismatched color look. This being said, if you are on the last flashing mode and bump the button then the shoe will turn off. You press the button once more to turn on the LEDs and can start cycling through colors and flash modes.\n\nOverall, these shoes perform exactly as advertised! My son has been using the shoes steadily for almost three weeks and that is including on rainy days without issue. Thanks for watching!\n\nGiven sample to test thoroughly and return my personal honest opinion. I create videos to demonstrate that I have tested the product and have made no false statements.", "summary": "Very bright!

It is cute....would like a size up but need this for vacation that we leave for tomorrow so am thinking of just dealing with it being a bit tight on top (like a t-shirt).  You can see through it (in white) which I'm fine with for a cover up but wouldn't use this as a dress.  I would say this fits as expected.\n\nUPDATE:  I wound up buying a large and had the medium which was sent in error.  I didn't see a difference between the two sizes and actually once I washed them they shrunk and sadly I am not able to use either (put in the donation bin).

In the real Hobo one side has an internal zipper for coins and on the other side it has additional card slots. But the biggest disappointment in that its very flimsy and doesn't have a whole lot of structure, so when you try to open it in a hurry  it doesn't open easily like many other reviews have mentioned. I suppose with the Hobo being real leather its more structured and has a lot more options than this product. Wasn't too crazy about this light grey color I got, more of an off white. Will have to return. Btw, you can buy the real Hobo at a Nordstrom's Rack near you for $59.00, and it will last you a lifetime. Believe me, I have several form like ten years ago. This purchase made me go back in my closet and grab an old vintage looking one, and this morning when I was going to my local coffee place someone asked right away if it was a Hobo from the dark ages.

I'm 5'7\" and about 140 lbs and I ordered the medium size. These fit perfect, they are a good length in the back and a little long in the front but still look good. They are not to wide so it closes nice when wrapping it around but doesn't have to much extra fabric when left open. I am not pregnant or nursing and these work for me. I also want to add that I wear these with dresses, shorts, and pants. You can dress up an outfit or dress it down with these and since I got the black and charcoal I can pretty much wear them with anything. The fabric is very thin but is really soft, light weight, stretchy, and super comfortable. It also seems to be well made and durable for how thin it is. The thiness is not a problem for me as I was looking for something light weight because its summer right now, These probably would not work for colder weather.\nAll in all this is an excellent product at an excellent price. It feels much more expensive then what it is and seems of great quality. I would definitely have to pay more in a department store.\n* I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review. This however, did not affect my opinion or review of the product in anyway. I depend on reviews for everything that i purchase so i try and be as honest and helpful as possible in my reviews in the hopes others do the same.

Williams", "reviewText": "This set of cardigans has quickly become a daily staple in my professional wardrobe. As many office workers know, even in the heat of summer office buildings are often kept uncomfortably cold. I've tried many different solutions for this. Sweaters I find to be mostly too hot. Some other cardigans have tiny, tight, constricting arms. Some are so thin that they are useless. Some are so tight around the armpits that sweating there is encouraged while the rest of the body is still cold. These, however, have none of those problems. They are basically perfect. I wear one or the other of these cardigans every day.\nThey did have quite a few loose, leftover threads hanging from the hems which seemed a little sloppy (see pics) but those threads can be easily snipped. I ordered a large since I'm pregnant and wanted to make sure they were amply sized and I am glad I did.\n\nPros:\n- Good weight fabric; not too heavy or light\n- Comfortable, not ridiculously tight little sleeves\n- Flattering as well as functional\n\nCons:\n- Came with some easily-trimmed loose threads\n\nIn conclusion, this is a good set of cardigans. Can't go wrong with them, I think. I received them at reduced cost for reviewing purposes and they have quickly become daily favorites, keeping me comfortable at work. I can't wait to use them for breastfeeding as well.

It was a little bigger than I anticipated when I ordered it (I don't carry much with me, usually), but then I found need to carry a bit more for a season, and it's just perfect for that. There are a lot of compartments, so it is easy to organize my things and know right where to find what I am looking for. All of the zippers go the opposite direction from every other purse I have ever owned, so that is taking some getting-used-to, but I should.\n\nMy one complain about this purse is that the material doesn't seem to be of very good quality. I've had it about a month and already, reams of the fabric are tearing off where the hems are. The ends of the zippers are starting to fray. I'm not sure how long this purse will last, which is disappointing because it is such an excellent design.\n\nUPDATE: I've now been carrying this bag for a couple of months, and the canvas is starting to turn blue instead of brown. I haven't spilled anything on it; it's just turning by exposure, I guess. Very disappointing. Still love the shape and style of the bag, but wish the materials were better quality.\n\nUPDATE #2: I've now been carrying this bag for about 4 months, and the stitching on the inside pocket came completely undone, which means that small items fell between the pocket and the outer canvas of the bag, lost in that abyss, and the zipper pulled right off the end of its tracks. Stitching is starting to come off in other places, as well, namely around zippers and other \"high traffic\" areas on this purse.

It doesnt seem to be appropriate to compare it to watches costing much more, but comparing it only to inexpensive watches it needs to be clear thats what the rating is based on.  Compared to expensive watches it would not rate 4 or 5 stars, but compared with only inexpensive watches its probably superior.  Im splitting the difference and giving it a well-deserved 4 stars.\n\nJudged only on aesthetics, and not including the lack of a high-end name, it would do just fine against much more expensive watches, in my opinion.  Certainly less so if the movement/mechanics and likelihood of many years of durability are factored in.  Compared with most inexpensive watches I think the appearance, coupled with whats been good time-keeping over the short time Ive had it, rank it well above most.\n\nPlease note that in the fourth photo I'm posting the color appears more golden than it should.\n\nProbably to be expected at the price, this watch does not come in a fancy box, or even a watch box of any kind.  It came in an Amazon box, with the watch itself in an envelope of bubble wrap and an inner plastic sleeve.  Nothing fancy there.\n\nThe instruction card doesnt really provide instructions, including only maintenance, cleaning, cautions, battery indicator, an explanation of the water resistance rating(s), and the Operation Guarantee Certificate.\n\nEveryone knows how to pull the setting knob on a watch to set the time, but unless Im missing something, and I don't think I am, the three mini in-face dials and the two extra buttons are purely decorative.  Ive got a more expensive watch with those same things so I knew how I expected them to operate, but I now see that the Amazon description doesnt even note the mini dials or extra buttons.  Because the instructions are so limited I cant be sure, but those things really do seem to be decorative only.  However, they do add quite a bit of visual interest and make it look like a much more expensive watch.\n\nAlso worth noting is that this watch does make a very soft tic-tic-tic sound, audible only in a very quiet room.\n\nBottom line:  I find this to be an attractive watch that appears to be well-made.  At the price I think its most likely it would be unreasonable to expect this to be anything like a legacy watch, but Im amazed to see how good looking inexpensive watches can be.  So given that, as well as the various caveats Ive noted, it would be easy to recommend this as an inexpensive watch to a friend.  Just don't consider it to be on par with watches costing multiples of the price!\n\nI received this watch at a discount  not free (even given the low price)  but as you can see, Ive made note of all the negative as well as positive aspects I can think of.  I hope this review helps.", "summary": "Great look for the price, works well (although I can't imagine that at this price it will be a legacy watch).", "unixReviewTime": 1468368000}

It is not vegan of course.\nCondition - The package arrived in good shape, on time, and the sale was smooth. No problems.\nConstruction - The aroma of leather is the fist sensory experience of the wallet, next is the attractiveness of the leather workmanship. Now the leather is such that it will get scratches, adding to the beauty of the leather. This wallet can be polished to get out scratches and marks, but I prefer them - has more of a wild west feel. I try to show you the details in the photos. I checked all the seams and made sure it checked out as quality leather and it did.\nTHE PERFECT GIFT - the wallet makes a great gift for any vegan who annoys you - really a lot.\nIt is hard to tell the level of quality from the photos, but it is a quality design and good quality construction.\nThis is all I have for you about Genuine Leather Zip Around Wallet for Men I received this Leather Wallet with a Gift Box at a discount to test and review and very glad that I did. I value product reviews, as I rely on other's reviews often to make my own purchase decisions.

My reviews are always honest and thorough. Some items are acquired at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review and feedback, but most items are purchased at Amazon's stated price.\n\nThis item was purchased at a reduced price during a sale event in exchange for my review and honest feedback.

My Dad is getting up in years, and it worries me that he is always carrying around so many bills, credit cards, insurance cards,etc.(a new wallet always spurs you on to clean out the old one)  He isn't always careful about how he gets money out of his wallet, and if you throw in a little anesthesia or numbing agents, he gets really bad!  I've had to take him to the pharmacy a couple of times after procedures, and he always wants to go in. He's just not safe in there like that.  This being a zip around is going to help a lot to keep everything inside.  There are plenty of slots for cards, and a nice ID window for his drivers license.  The quality of the leather seems very nice, and the stitching is all done very well.  I do like that there is a little coin holder in this too, so he can keep any small items in there or use it for change.  The zipper is a good strong one, and it doesn't catch or snag anywhere - it's action is nice and smooth.  I received this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

First it holds a lot, and most importantly it has a very strong metal zipper. I tried testing its limits and if you ridiculously over stuff it, the zipper can be forced closed but the two sided will separate but with this zipper its easier than with most to bring the zipper back to reclose it properly.

They do look a lot like a very popular brand lol. So my 4 year old son normally wears a size 10.5 so I ordered a size 11. They just fit with no room to grow. I like the shoes so much I am going to order him a size 12 and he can wear the 11's the remainder of the summer. I would not recommend wearing these shoes in the rain or wet weather since the outer shell is like a knitted shell. After a month or so I will comment on how the stitching holds up. Hey they look cool and my boy loves them so that was worth the thirty dollars lol\nUpdate: noticed the other 5 reviews are gone, also the shoes are no longer in stock soon after I left my review. Was looking to order the larger size. Anyone else think this is strange? I still like the shoes, hope they come back.", "summary": "Great kid shoes for dry weather!", "unixReviewTime": 1471219200}

I got them for my son and I'm thinking about getting another color for my daughter. I love the texture at the toe and it appears breathable. The no-tie laces are great for young children. They hold tight without the hassle of keeping them tied. The back of the shoe was soft and comfortable and hit at a nice spot on the heel. As with most shoes that are not name brand, the sole of the shoe is what gives it away and makes it appear a little cheap. However, of others I've tried, this one is more molded and cushioned and seems really nice.\n\nI love these shoes and they definitely appear a good value. We are saving them for the start of the school year, but I will update with wear if there is anything notable. I received this product for testing purposes.

I would suggest not to order a size up as suggested but go down a size. the material is very stretchy and you want a bathing suit to be snug, because any suit expands in water!  this suit would have kept falling down if I wore it wet.  by the way this is my first bikini at 39 years old and am so excited the other one fit.. I had a c section 15 years ago and while I consider myself in shape, ive never had a toned tummy. this type of suit made me feel super feminine and sexy for the first time in a bathing suit.

The bikini is great for when we are at home but when we are at the lake I like her to look a little bit more conservative but still look feminine and look her age.\n\n  DESIGN: This is the cutest design that I have ever seen in a bathing suit. My daughter was told repeatedly that she looked like a pin up model in it. The bathing suit is mostly a navy blue color with the chest portion of it being striped with navy blue and white. The bow that is located in the middle is a red and the straps that tie behind the neck are also red. I love that this bathing suit covers up but still looks as good as it does, The bottom portion of the bathing suit is built like a pair of shorts so there is no bottom showing. The bathing suit then covers it up some more because its built like a skirt. The top is cut very well as that most of the breast is covered. This is all great for those people out there that want to look cute without almost being naked at the pool.\n\n  MATERIAL: The material that is used in this bathing suit is thick and of good quality. The material is really absorbent but also dries rather quickly when you are in the sun. At first inspection there were no tears or loose threading on the suit at all even after wearing this a couple times there are no stray threads.\n\n  FIT: My daughter is a size 7 and I purchased this in a size 8 and the suit fit her perfect. There was no riding up on the back side and she never had to pull the front of the bathing suit up. If anyone has done this, you know what a pain it can be and those of you that don't I hope you never find out. The straps on the top did not dig into her neck, they are a little thicker so they are more comfortable and I know I like to be comfortable at the lake.\n\n  BONUS: A beaded necklace comes with the bathing suit.\n\n  OVERALL: This is a great bathing suit for anyone that is looking stay modest but still look cute at the lake or river. The way that the bathing suit fit means that its not going to show the world all your goodies. The look of this bathing suit is really retro and pin up modelish. The suit fit comfortable and was pretty true to size. The suit doesnt chafe or dig into the skin at all.\n\n  Ireceivedthis product for free in exchange for my true and unbiased opinion.

The metal is good quality and heavy duty (not cheap feeling at all). This slides onto my wrist over my hand with no problem, and it is small enough to where it stays on without sliding off. The three bangles connected by the heart charm is a clever idea, as this sits really nice on my wrist and looks different than anything else that I have.

My solution was to not wear a bra and that worked out fine. The cut of this dress makes it more forgiving than other cuts. The material is not the best quality and would have to be washed by hand or on the delicate cycle to make sure it maintains its shape. There are some stings for detail that are very loose on the bust so I am kinda concerned about those.

A couple of draw backs for me though, one I do not really care for the extra big Velcro tab on the rear of the hat and on top and the stitching on them ONLY. The plus side for me is the single stitch on these badge plates makes it easy to remove with no damage to the hat. The other down side was I did not care for the packaging of the product being in a plastic shipping bag and arriving smashed. I will say it did not affect the hat one bit and hat popped up with no creases. For those two reasons I was going to rate this only 4 stars but once I affixed the OLD GLORY patch on the front I feel in love again.  Show our pride today and every day!!

I bought them to match the Attraco Tankini top that I got a few days ago.  These shorts make that a perfect set because the black offsets the floral print of the top.\n\nThere are two things about these boy leg shorts that I would change if I could.  1) I would have the legs cut probably 2-3 inches longer down the leg, and 2) I would add two or three inches more material to the crotch area.  Thats because these shorts pucker up in the front crotch area.  When wearing them, it feels as if the shorts are riding up and bunching up in the middle of my legs.  I was worried that it was noticeable but my daughters said that you can tell the shorts are riding up in that area, but nothing personal can be seen.  If I could, I would suggest to the maker that the inseam have a few more inches of material to help get rid of that sensation.  (I checked out the way it was sewn, and the shorts are well sewn, all stitches straight and no hanging strings or frayed edges.  But I did notice the middle crotch piece is only a few inches wide, and thats probably not enough for bigger sized people.  Probably a couple of more inches there would alleviate the problem).\n\nNote:  For the question \"How does this product fit?  I answered Somewhat Small because of the length and the bunching problem.  But the waistline and short \"body\" iteself, it was a perfect fit for a size 3X person.\n\nSo, I will use these bottoms until I can locate another pair of black shorts that are a little longer and don't have that bunching up in the crotch problem.  Now, these may work much better for someone who is smaller, but for me its uncomfortable and I hope to find another pair that can match up with the great top I got.\n\nRigorous honesty is a personal policy of mine so as a buyer and a reviewer, it is important to me first as a buyer to choose products that I am interested in to help serve myself and my family in some positive way.  I also look to the reviews written about the products to help me determine if I want to try something new or something different so when I write a review, I strive to provide information and insight about the product that would interest me and help me make that yes or no decision to purchase it again.  All the opinions given, good or bad, are my own.  The product is only used by me or someone in my immediate family.

I was not sure what to expect when I purchased this. All I knew is hey this is colapsable so there fore it will save space !? We do a lot of Hingis as a family so that is always important having three kids and a stroller, more space saved the better.\n\nSo, the material used for this water bottle is very hick, it is very sturdy. My son bit it and it didn't even leave a mark. When you have any liquid in it at all even a small amount it stands up on it son. Yu can suck water out or squirt it into your mouth air is pushed out of he water bottle and when you're done it fills itself back up. It is leak resistant which is freaking awesome! My one year old can drink out of this water bottle which is a huge plus. The kid that is connected to this is also great it snaps on and has a lock! When the lock is not on it has a button the white circle yu easily press and the water bottle cap pops right open with ease! This water bottle is great for me as a runner i can throw it in the stroller not have to worry about pulling a kid or star up or taking off a water bottle cap! It's great I want more! No negative remarks at all! I purchased this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

It just takes up to much space.\n\nHow to use the product: You have to open the top to roll up the bottom, then close the top and hook the rubber string into the loop on the opposite side.\n\nMy experience with the product: I love it! It's spill proof and adorable.\n\nCompare it to other brands or similar serving products: I've had flat collapsible water bottles before and I just don't like them.

There were no off odors or tastes to this bottle.  When I drink water from it, the water is all I taste.  I love that it's dishwasher safe (top rack only).  When I go to my exercise class, the bottle stands without worrying about tipping, even when empty.  That's because, as I drink the water from the bottle, there is a tiny air hole in the top that pressurizes the bottle so it doesn't collapse until I purposely squeeze the air out of it.\n\nThis bottle is completely water tight, so it's safe to toss in your backpack, even when filled with water.  Just make sure the top is screwed on tightly, the lid top is snapped securely to the bottle.  There is a latch to make sure the top stays securely closed.  Yet, if you're going to have access to potable water, you can squeeze the air out to collapse the bottle, and there is a strap to keep the bottle rolled up in a neat little bundle.", "summary": "Great for camping or hiking", "unixReviewTime": 1471824000}

My favorite time of year.  I love going to the beach and the park and doing all sorts of out door activities.  The problem is that we need to make sure we are getting a lot more fluids to drink.  We usually throw a bunch of disposable water bottles in a bag or in the car and take with us but that is very wasteful.  We would like to use more reusable water bottles and make less waste.  One of the problems, however, is that when you finish the water you can't just deposit the bottle in a recycling container and go about your day.  You have to take it home with you.  When we are all out and about there are a lot of us and that means a lot of different water bottles to be carrying around.  That is heavy and inconvenient.\n\nThe great thing about the collapsible water bottle is that when you are done drinking you can roll lit up and it takes up a fraction of the space as a traditional water bottle.  This is so much easier to take with you and just tuck it into your bag.\n\nAnother advantage is that the silicone is very light weight. This means that in addition to taking up less space in your bag it is also much lighter which means less strain on your back as you are lugging these things about.\n\nI will caution that this is really best for older kids or for adults.  There is a silicone \"strap\" that holds the water bottle rolled up and I feel that it would be pretty easy for a younger kid to break this.  That said, with a bit of supervision this should not really be a problem.\n\nI also did not like the way that the water stayed in the spout. I found sometime that it would \"spurt\" when I opened the lid and would get me a bit wet.  This is something that you can prepare for and be careful when you are opening the bottle but something that you should nevertheless be aware of.\n\nI received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest reviews.  I know how important reviews are, especially if you are buying from a company that you are not as familiar with or are buying a product that you do not have much personal experience with.  The views of others that have tried out the product can definitely help you form your decision.  I therefore take giving reviews very seriously and strive for honesty and completeness.

While I haven't seen too many collapsable water bottles, I think it is a really cool idea. This water bottle is a nice size, I think you would use this water bottle for things like traveling, hiking or any other adventure where you would like to keep your things confined. We ordered the black water bottle to keep it gender neutral since both my husband and I will be using the water bottle. As you finish the water bottle you can roll up the bottle towards the lid and secure the rolled up bottle on the lid. This really keeps the water bottle in a since compact formation while you aren't using it. If you are short on space, this is a great feature of the water bottle. The lid is nice as well with a cool design. There is a latch that secures over the button you press to open the water bottle. This ensures that the water bottle will not open when the button is pressed and the latch is in the locked mode. Additionally the mouth piece for how you drink the water is cool. The water does not flow freely so you will need to suck on it like you would a straw. I like this feature, but it is a little more work to get the water than a wide mouth water bottle. I would definitely recommend this water bottle to anyone who is looking for a functional/ cool water bottle for traveling or exploring. I am satisfied with the overall quality of the water bottle.

I was intrigued by the description of the MyFriday Collapsible Water Bottle, so I agreed to review it at the seller's request. After trying it out, Im impressed by the size and versatility of the bottle, although the feel takes some getting used to.\n\nWhen the bottle first arrived, I was surprised by the small size and weight of the envelope, and I wondered if Id been sent the correct item. I shouldnt have worried. The bottle is made out of a fairly thick rubbery substance that collapses easily (you roll it up like a tube of toothpaste). It has a small plastic strap that wraps around the collapsed container portion of the bottle to keep it rolled up, When collapsed, the bottle is only about 5 long and can easily be stored in a knapsack if storage space is at a premium. When the bottle is full, the plastic strap can also be used to hang the bottle on the strap of a backpack. When the bottle is unwrapped, it regains its normal shape easily.\n\nThe MyFriday bottle holds about 24 ounces of water, and the neck of the bottle is about two inches wide so you can easily fill the bottle with standard ice cubes from a refrigerator icemaker.  The bottle is about 8.5 long without the screw-on plastic cap and 10 long with the cap. It comes in four colors: black, blue, magenta, and orange. The bottle we received was blue. The bottle seems quite durable; obviously, the rubbery container portion of the bottle will withstand a fall from a table or onto rocky ground, and the plastic cap seems fairly sturdy as well.\n\nThe operation of the MyFriday bottle is fairly simple as well. It has a large white button on the front what, when pushed, releases the spring-loaded cap, Push the cap back into place and it snaps shut, with a little metal hook to ensure it stays shut. The push button operation isn't quite as smooth as I would have liked; you sometimes have to jiggle the cap and button a bit to make sure it snaps shut. The opening at the top of the bottle to drink from is quite large, measuring about 1 x 0.5, so you can drink a good bit of water at each swallow. Also, the bottle opening operates like a straw; you suck on it to get water. This means that you won't have any spills if you accidentally knock the bottle over on a desk or table.\n\nSome people may find that the MyFriday bottle takes some time to get used to. Even when its filled with water, it gives way when you grip it, unlike traditional hard plastic or metal bottles. However, although it has s springy, rubbery feel, after washing the bottle in the dishwasher, it did not have any type of plastic or chemical taste whatsoever. The bottle is not insulated, but when filled with ice cubes and cold water, the contents stayed fairly cold for a couple of hours, although the outside of the bottle did sweat a bit.\n\nOverall, the MyFriday bottle is a good bottle for outdoor or office use. It is sturdy, keeps water cool for a fair length of time, and has a larger capacity than many similar products. The operation of the pushbutton cap isn't as smooth as it should be, so it can be a bit tricky to make sure it stays shut, and the bottle definitely has a different feel to it. Still, the MyFriday bottle has found its way to my office desk where it stays in use every day.", "summary": "Wrap Up This Bottle", "unixReviewTime": 1473120000}

I fill this up when I go somewhere and bring a sodastream filled with water so I can refill this bottle! There was a bit of a learning curve trying to drink out of a bottle that isn't solid but after a week, drinking out of a hard container feels weird. It has a little air intake valve (you can see it in the third picture, the white dot with four thin slits around it above the drinking spout) is the to help fill it back to regular size after you drink from it (it doesn't leak) and the spout that you drink out of is a suction system, meaning that you have to suck the water out and because of the little air intake valve, backwash is never a worry (great if you have a kid (or many) who like to drink your water while you're not looking or you're out and they are thirsty). Something also noteworthy, one of the times daughter was drinking out of it she didn't put it down properly and crashed to first to the laminate floor and it didn't get a scratch on it. No chips, no dents, no cracks, nothing! It hit pretty hard and it still looks and worked like new! The silicone rolls up very easily and holds securely (I did that then shook it vigorously and flying it forward and backward many times), though I never use that function of it because I just keep refilling it. For a couple of days I left water in it for most of the day to see if it would get a funny taste, when the water was warm (sitting in a warm car) it tasted a bit different but it was still drinkable if it was room temp or cooler it tasted like you just put it in there. I wish that the bottle held more water and came in a purple color (so I could get one for my daughter) but other than that it's a fantastic bottle!", "summary": "Fantastic bottle!!", "unixReviewTime": 1468195200}

Ive seen more than a handful of people wearing these around, especially since I live near the beach. This thin almost sheer tassel cardigan makes a great beach-wear wrap or a cover up for your swimsuit. Its light and fashionable, and the material and tassels look great as wind blows through them. Made of rayon, the thin material is soft and smooth and is quite comfortable.\n\nThe design of this specific cardigan is an abstract white and black monochrome print and is quite neutral and beachy looking. The material seems to be quite wrinkly, and Im not sure if I like this feature. It makes the cover up look a bit messy looking, although that might be the effect the maker was aiming for. Im not sure about this. Although some may like this print, Im not sure it looks good on me. I feel the wrinkly material makes me look quite unkempt.\n\nThe tassels on the bottom are pretty neat, but I realized that they get tangled up pretty easily and become extremely frayed if you're not careful with it, especially after wash. I suggest using a laundry mesh bag (the ones you use to wash delicates) to wash this next time to avoid further fraying of the tassels.\n\nIn the end, I believe this would make a great beach cover up but not as a normal cardigan you wear out every day casually.  Ill probably wear this on my trips to the beach but am not sure if I will wear this often on normal days. This would be a great purchase for people who go to the beach a lot or want a fashionable wrap for pool parties, etc. I received this cover up cardigan for testing and evaluation and this is my honest and unbiased review upon thorough use.", "summary": "Makes a great beach-wear cover up but the material is very wrinkly.", "unixReviewTime": 1467331200}

I got it back but she wants one.. She is in the pictures wearing the hat, I am wearing the kimono in the others.\n\nThis is a loose, easy to throw on kimono that is great for the beach or pool. I don't think I would wear it with an outfit for street wear although it looks great on the model in the description. The kimono tends to be wrinkly which I think is the way it is supposed to be  That doesn't take away from its looks and versatility. It can be worn loosely sliding down one shoulder, thrown on like a little jacket, even belted. It super lightweight and won't be too hot even in the sun. Great for keeping the sun off in a stylish way.\n\nThe only small issue is the tassels fray and get tangled a bit. I am going to wash this either by hand or on the dedicates cycle and then hang it to dry to avoid ruining the tassels.\n\nI got a size Medium. It was hard to choose considering it is not at all fitted. I went with the medium for length. I am 5'5', 124 pounds. My sister is 5'3\", 130 pounds and it fit us both well. To be honest, I think she looks better in the kimono than I do. The couple of inches of length looks better. In all I love this kimono and have obviously worn it already to the pool. My sister is going to order one for herself if she can't pry mine from me. (She can't.) It's a nice alternative to run of the mill cover ups and so very lightweight and cool that it won't add warmth on a hot day when you just want to throw something over your suit but not wear anything heavy. Super cute and versatile.\n\nI received this item in exchange for my honest evaluation. I am not affiliated with the seller and I was not compensated for my review. I had no idea if I would like this since it isn't really my style but I do and I think there are loads of ways to wear it. It's super lightweight and looks adorable.

I got this for my cousin who is having a baby soon thinking I would get her bigger clothes for her child to eventually grow in to. However, this may take him a while. I got the 18-24 mo and it almost fits my 3 year old who usually wears a 3-4T! Though she is a girl I am not sure how great a size difference there is between clothing.

Opening the awesome and unique looking tie box was exciting. I won't show pictures of the cool box because I myself an a sucker for cool surprises and I do not want to ruin it for you. Sure it's just presentation but we all love a nice opening right? Otherwise why do we worry about gift wrapping being pretty? Anyway the way it arrives in and of itself is cool but the tie, WOW just STUNNING!\n\nMy husband and I recently bought him 5 new ties costing anywhere from 35 and UP from there. I wish I had found these sooner! Granted there are limited color and pattern choices but the choices they do have are very nice and in fact I have three more of these in my \"wish list\" and will buy my hubby more of them here and there.\n\nThis grey color is sooooo gorgeous and my husband LOVES it - looks great with his favorite lavender business shirt as there is just the slight touch of lavender in this tie too.\n\nThere were no unwanted creases or wrinkles in the tie when opened.\n\n100% silk and you sure can see and feel the quality!\n\nThis is a regular width tie - not super broad nor a skinny tie - just perfect and the width my husband prefers, actually he won't wear skinny ties and I have given several of them away because of that. This is a nice size for every day business wear, going out, parties, events, and anytime you want to dress to impress and this color I selected would go with many different colors of tops.\n\nThere is a slight texture to the tie as well which you can see in the images.\n\nI think this is a great tie and color choice as well for wearing with a business casual shirt and some nice designer jeans for \"casual day\" at work which usually means you still have to look good.\n\nI do like that it is stain resistant although I am not going to test this and yes it is dry clean only but its SILK so of course you do not want to just wash it.\n\nThe listing says it is designed in Italy which sounds really fancy and I do not know about all that but I can tell you it feels, looks, and is made JUST as well as the ones we spent way way more for and now I feel stupid for buying the expensive ones.\n\nI have looked and Origin Ties has pages upon pages of listings of men's ties and I have been going through them saving a ton of them to my wish list for my hubby.\n\nI DO update reviews if and when I run into future issues with an item and will do the same for this product but I have high hopes that it will last as long as the ties I pay way more for will.\n\nI hope this review was helpful.

I selected a size Medium - I generally go between medium and large - for reference I have a 38 DD chest, weigh around 140 to 145 and have large upper arms. The fabric is stretchy enough to accommodate a larger chest and arm area.\nEverything about this top is awesome from the draping to the stitching I am impressed. You can also wear it a few different ways by how you drape and adjust the neckline and where you let the bottom of the shirt rest on, above, or below the hips.\nI wore this outside today in 97 degree fahrenheit weather and it was so nice and breezy.\nYou can wear with anything from office clothing to gardening clothing - it is very versatile.\nAs the listing says it is flattering for all body types with enough draping and ruching to allow you to hide belly fat, and to accentuate the areas you do want to show off.\nIf you wanted it to be more like a tunic or dress I would go a size up as with the medium it was more fitted although still plenty of room to play with adjusting with my size I could have went medium OR large and been perfectly happy with it.

Assuming the new packaging removes the issue with the creases, this is absolutely a five star tie, so I have increased my rating from four to five stars. Original review below for details.**\n\nThis review is for the green tie.\n\nThis is a gorgeous tie.  I plan on keeping it, but I will not buy any more ties from this company.  Why?  The packaging leaves a firm crease that is a bit of a pain to remove.  Why would a company that primarily sells ties package a tie in such a stupid way as to leave a very firm crease where it will be visible when worn?!?\n\nThe tie arrives in a black envelope, approximately 15\" long. When I first saw the package, I thought it looked rather nice.  Then I removed the tie and saw a very prominent crease.  I have a short torso, but when tied, the crease is below the knot and very visible.  It can be removed with an iron on silk setting and a soft cloth to cover the tie with.  But I would not order a tie knowing that I would have to spend time ironing it to make it wearable.  I have ordered a number of ties online, and this is the first time I have ever received one with any crease, yet alone one so prominent and in a spot that would be visible when worn.\n\nBecause of the way the tie is folded to fit in the envelope, there are actually two creases, one on the thicker front-facing part, and one on the thinner part that is hidden when the tie is worn.  The latter is not such a big deal, but the former is just absurd.\n\nOther ties I have purchased online are folded about halfway, so that the crease will not be visible when tied, and then loosely folded so as not to cause additional creases.  That is how it should be done.\n\nAgain, that being said, this is an absolutely gorgeous tie.  The green is more of a turquoise/teal color, and it really pops in real life, but the pattern is subtle enough to keep the tie from being too loud.  It's very vibrant, but at the same time not too distracting.  I would highly recommend it if the company fixed their packaging, or if you do not care about having to iron out a crease on a newly purchased tie.", "summary": "Gorgeous tie", "unixReviewTime": 1476144000}

It is all doable if the manufacturer fixes some simple issues. The outside of the case has a nice smooth look. I was confused about the inside, because it was kind of fuzzy, but I looked back at the description and realized that it is microfiber and meant to provide more protection to the case. Because you don't see or feel it once the case is actually on the phone, it's not a big deal, I just thought it was weird. If it really does protect the case more then it's okay to keep that part since like I said you don't see it once it's on the phone. The biggest issue is that when I was holding the case, the bottom part just came off -- I went back to the description again and saw that it is supposed to be a 2 piece case, so at least I know it didn't break, BUT I did try to lock it in tighter and there is no lock or click. It just slides together without locking together, so I would be really concerned that it's going to randomly fall off while on my phone between putting in my pocket, purse, or just while using it. It was a great idea to make  it easier to put the case on the phone, but these two pieces need to lock together tightly in order for it to really work. If this issue is fixed then this could be a great case. For now I'm just too afraid that what is supposed to protect my phone is going to fall apart.\n\nDisclaimer: I received this product for free or at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

I have been looking for luggage straps for an upcoming trip where I know we will be checking multiple bags. I am always worried about someone taking our bags because they look just like all the other black rolling suitcases on the luggage carousel. These straps are so bright and noticeable! The pictures don't do them justice, they are fluorescent (I chose green for my husband and pink for me). The straps can be used together as shown in the pictures using the snaps to hold them together or you can use them separately. They extend to a pretty large size and should easily fit any regular suitcase (might be able to get them around width-wise on extremely big cases but probably won't fit length-wise). The straps are made of a sturdy material that doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. They buckles are plastic but strong. They do not lock like other straps I've seen. I didn't want locking straps as the TSA doesn't allow you to lock suitcases shut and they'll cut the lock off to check your bags. They also have a tag on them to add your personal information so there is no need for an additional luggage tag if you don't want one.

The stitching on the bag, as well as on the strap, is even.  The strap is reinforced by a grosgrain canvas type backing that is perfectly dyed to match the bag. This backing is also evenly and sturdily stitched onto the strap. The strap also has padding at the point where it rests on one's shoulder, which is a nice touch.  The metal hardware appears to be sturdy.\n\nThe bag has a flip over front flap, and the interior of the bag has a polyester lining.  The interior zipper compartment has a zippered pocket suitable for small items,  as well as a zippered pouch that is perfect for one's smartphone accessories. There is also a pocket in which one may place one smartphone.  The bag also has two sections in the interior compartment.  The smaller section is suitable for one's Kindle. The main section can accommodate those items that one normally carries in one's bag.  There is also an exterior zippered compartment for those items for which one might want quick and easy access, such as one's keys.\n\n I selected the bag in the color red, and it is a beautiful, rich red . This bag, which I received from the seller in exchange for an impartial review, is made of PU leather, which is a faux leather made from polyurethane. The product details on Amazon advise that one should air out the bag in the fresh air for a few days, as the bag may smell a little. Well, that is certainly an understatement! The bag,  which is made in China,  has an almost toxic, overwhelming smell of some noxious chemical, rendering the bag unusable. I have been airing out the bag for almost a week now, and it still stinks to high heaven. The stench is so strong that it has lingered in my house for days, despite keeping the windows open. In fact, the stench causes my lips and tongue to tingle. This cannot be a good sign. Consequently, I cannot recommend this otherwise nice bag.", "summary": "A NICE BAG WITH AN OVERWHELMINGLY NOXIOUS, ALMOST TOXIC, SMELL...", "unixReviewTime": 1466640000}

Within a week of owning the back and using it to hold my wallet, keys, and sometimes a water bottle, the zip broke. The teeth of the zip would move or open, rendering the zip itself useless. I also start to notice the back would bend when using it over the shoulder. The back of the bag was too soft so the straps pulled on it making it bend regardless of wether heavy or light items were inside. The buttons that clasp on either side were extremely week too. They would constantly pop open, which let to the zip opening, and me walking around with a thrive target on my back. I really wished this bag would be of high quality since it is very pretty.

It is really great quality! The cotton fabric is thick. You can tell it is made really well. It also has a nice stretch to it, so it is definitely not stiff. It feels like very high quality fabric. Also, the tulle is great quality too. I have had issues with that thin tulle in the past. It tears very easily, and barely survives one use. That is not the case with this at all. It feels like it will hold up really well. I ordered the 12-18 month size, and I would say it is true to size. I put it on a baby that wears 12-month-old size clothing, and it seems like she still has plenty of room to grow in it. She is on the smaller end of the sizing range, which is why I believe it is true to size. Overall, I would highly recommend this outfit. It is just so adorable. It is not boring like most baby clothes. It looks like she is instantly dressed up, even though it is just a quick and simple onesie. I am extremely happy with this purchase. I do think it would be cute for a party, or even something as simple as a trip to the mall. It is just very versatile in my opinion. I also love the bold, gold queen letters on the front. Adds a bit of sass to the outfit. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.", "summary": "Such a cute outfit!", "unixReviewTime": 1470096000}

The material was super flexible and looks very much like fins; it's sparkly and irridescent (sp?).  A little bit of the glitter does rub off, but not enough to change the appearance of the suit.  It held up nicely in the pool and didn't become heavy or stretch at all.  Great little costume that can be used for swimming.

It bunches a bit at the stomach area. I will order her one size smaller and see if it works out better. We will be keeping this though as she can play in it and grow into it even more for next summer. Plus it will be nice to have an extra one around when her cousin visits and they want to play mermaid.

More so the sizing is completely off... it seems like a one - size - fits - all kind of product.

I got the 120CM (4-5 Years)- Size L for my average-sized 6 year old and it is still huge, loose, and baggy. There are several ways to wear and tie the bathing suit top, but no matter how we do it, it is not tight enough nor fitted well so it just constantly slides around... one of those one-size ill-fitting tops that would fit a grown woman also. I could go on and on about the sizing since I'm not sure why there even was a sizing option it the first place with such a bad fit. If I was buying a one-size fits all set my expectations would have been different and maybe the rating slightly higher.\n\nI did get this item at a discount price to ensure quality testing and leaving an honest review.

I believe people should not look at the first picture but the second if they want an opinion as to how this will look, I've included some photos so you can hopefully see how it works, how they can walk.  Daughter didn't wear for very long complaining it was itchy but wore the bottoms for a good amount of time.  Top was way to large so she wore her swimsuit top with the bottoms.  Bottoms fit just right, she is a size 7 girls and can fit some 6X.  At first this was not in stock and now that it is in stock it took some time to get to me and my daughter was very eager to see it, shame we waited as long as we did.  Love its purple color, and it being my daughters favorite she instantly loved it, and come on, who doesn't like mermaids?  I think the main photo of this should be the second picture so people know exactly what they are getting.  I believe the girl in the first photo is wearing something different and has monofins inside of it which gives it the different shape, and monofins are not included in this.\n\nUpdate:  These only lasted once in the pool. Its very much like a costume, and even then still doesn't look like a mermaid.  She was happy to get it, shes six and wore it in the pool and it greatly faded after one swim.  It is now very disheveled looking and she doesn't want to wear it.  I have some concern over what chemicals were used in this because of how itchy it was and how it dissipated with the swim so quickly. The top was barely wearable, nothing like the photo.  Wish I had included that in the photos but it went in the trash rather quickly.\nBlessed to of gotten the opportunity to receive this at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "... the top excited about this which makes me very pleased about this", "unixReviewTime": 1465776000}

She was specifically looking for a top to go with her existing mermaid swimtail. She loves it, and the top does indeed match her existing tail, so she's as happy as can be. However, I did need to make several modifications to it. We cut the bow off of the back of the bottoms and sewed the two triangle pieces together on the top so they didn't slide apart while she was swimming. The cut of the suit is not particularly flattering but she doesn't notice! The size chart was somewhat confusing because not all relevant measurements were listed but we went with the Large and it fits okay. She is slender and the bottoms are still a bit loose. The fabric has a subtle scale print, which is pretty. The top has a thin padding overall; some of the other reviews mentioned snipping it out but you would have to take apart a seam and sew it back together to remove it so we just left it in.

We have more mermaid dolls than I can count, mermaid clothes, bags, costumes, you name it.  I was able to purchase one of these mermaid bathing suits for my older daughter about 1.5 years ago but at the time I couldn't find one small enough for my younger daughter. Fast forward 1.5 years and my younger daughter is now big enough for one so of course she wanted nothing more than to match her big sister which led me to purchasing the PGXT Girl's Kids Princess Mermaid Tail Sea-maid Bikini Swimwear Bathing Suit.\n\nI'll admit I was a bit hesitant when I read the reviews about whether this suit was going to work for us but the price was right so it was a risk I was willing to take. Well, I'm so glad I did. The suit arrived very quick. The blue color is very pretty and vibrant. My daughter absolutely fell in love with it immediately and couldn't wait to try it on. She honestly looks so adorable in it.\n\nYou'll notice in my pictures there were a few lose strings but nothing that I could easily trim with a scissors. The lose strings had no effect on the actual bathing suit. The quality of the bathing suit seems to be decent and is very much in line with what I was expecting. My daughter is very slender so she has trouble with two piece bathing suits fitting her right in the first place but this really fit her okay. I ordered the smallest size which seems to be in line with a 2-3. The top is adjustable and the bottoms were just a little lose on the sides. The mermaid tale fit perfectly and she was able to easily walk around in it.\n\nI think this is a great suit for dress up or the pool. I really don't think there's too many little girls out there that wouldn't love it.

It was such a hit! I had been looking into getting her one with a green tail, but I didn't like how it looked at the bottom. This one flows sounds her ankles, giving the allusion of the mermaid tail. So fun! I remember going through a mermaid phase when I was her age, and I would have loved to have an Arial tail. It's fun to live vicariously through my kids. ;) I just wish it had swim bottoms included.\n\nShe loves wearing it as dress up, so is great that it has the openings at the bottom for her feet to come out. There is plenty of room for her legs to move around in it, and since it's made of swim suit material, it's very stretchy. She's super skinny, so the top was kind of big on her, but I expected as much with her size. But I mostly got it for the tail anyway, which I wanted to be long enough to cover her feet, so that's fine. When she wears it, I just put a safety pin in to tighten it up a bit, and it works great. I'm not sure how you'd actually wear the tail as a swimsuit, since it is just a long skirt that had been cut to look like a tail at the end. It's not tight around the ankles, so you can see right up it, and when you're swimming, it flows up, so you have to wear a swim bottom under it. I kind of wish I had bought one with the 3 pieces, including shorts, but I wasn't really thinking, and didn't realize this would be an issue until she tried it on.\n\nThe other little girls at her birthday party were seriously so jealous. The colors are so pretty together, and it's just every girl's dream to be a mermaid!\n\nDisclaimer: I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.", "summary": "Cute, but needs swim bottoms!", "unixReviewTime": 1466812800}

They are so cute with the added bow on the backside of the swim bottoms as well. Now let's talk about the top, it is not horrible but I feel there could have been a little more thought in the design and fit of the top. It is two flat triangles with two strings attached at the top of the triangles to tie around the neck. Then there are tow more strings attached to the outside corners of thes triangles to tie them around the chest . And the two triangles are connected with a tie about two to three inches between the triangles to keep it all together. For my granddaughter who is 10 the largest size fit her perfect but she's a little developed and the triangles being so flat it causes some showing of more of her chest area then preferred.\nI believe this particular style of mermaid tail and swimming suit is made for children under nine and not near tween time.\nI received this swim suit mermaid tail at a discount in return for my honest and unbiased opinion and review.", "summary": "Not made for tweens", "unixReviewTime": 1466812800}

It runs large. I am an hourglass figure, and it fit fabulous on top and through the arms, but it gradually gets larger as it goes down. I noticed the pear shaped woman rating it better than me. It probably suited her shape a little better. I usually look for a cut that goes in at the waist. This was huge around the waist and the butt (and I have a large bubble butt). It added an unnecessary bulk, especially at my lower back. I am going to try for a smaller size, but had to pay return shipping for that.\n2. It is very soft. This is not your typical wool pea coat. I can see why some women are saying it's cheap. I don't think it's cheap. I think it's just a softer not as structured type of material. I was actually going for comfort, so the material suits me well. It gives the look of structure with the feel of soft and thick almost sweatshirt comfort. I think it'll be great for a mild to moderate winter. Not sure how it will hold up on super cold days.\n3. Long-armed women: this coat will be fine on you, but it's not going to be fabulous. Typically coats are short on me exposing my wrists far more than I want. This does the same when my arms are bent, but not when they are straight. I will make do as I think I am the exception and that's the life I have to live. But again, it's not the worst I've seen.\n4. The price is fabulous. For what you are getting, you cannot beat the price. It's generous and longer than you'd think on. It will keep you warm. I think it's worth it. Thus the effort to get a smaller size.", "summary": "I noticed the pear shaped woman rating it better than me", "unixReviewTime": 1509667200}
