I loved the way it looked. I loved the fact it was reversible. I have a purse, shoes, and winter coat to match with this belt. The first flaw that I noticed was with the reversible part of the belt. If your familiar with reversible belts then you know they reverse at the belt clip. Anytime I sit down or bend over the clip opens like it would when you reverse it and pinches my stomach. It hurts REALLY BAD it's 2 pieces of medal opening up & clamping your skin in between them. The second flaw I noticed was after about 5 or six months the leather started to damage. It started coming apart at the edges. It's not like I wear the belt everyday either. I'm a stay at home mom with no transportation during the day. My daily wardrobe consists of sweatpants and athletic clothing. So it didn't start falling apart because of being used to often. I was very disappointed in this. I thought since it was designer brand the quality would be impeccable & least a very long time.

The material of the shirt itself is fairly thin, which is good for me currently because I get hot a lot being pregnant, but I would not recommend putting this in the dryer ever. It definitely needs to be hung dry. Also, after washing it before wearing it for the first time, some of the stitching on the crocheted part came loose and had to be tied and cut, so make sure you are washing this on a very gentle cycle.

My package arrived quick from China, but buyer beware the package has a customs label stating package content.  I have to laugh, I think my mailman thinks I have some kind of underwear fetish as I have received a few pair here lately.  Now about the pair that I received.  I ordered the white, black stripe with red thigh bands.  I ordered a large after reading some of the reviews and they fit great.  If your looking at the model you can see his manhood centered and very noticeable.  Mine sits and is positioned just like the model and the seam of my jeans rubbed that material and the material stitch work broke slightly after only about 8 hours of wear.  During the day the red thigh band rolled up and did not remain positioned, which was not uncomfortable.  When the thigh bands rolled up they rolled up evenly.  Where the white and black strips meet there is a thick seam and a seam across back in the same location and a seam running up and down the thighs.  Now here is where the unusual to wear comes in.  When the red thigh band rolls up from sit to stand and normal movement the seam in the front middle moves up allow the penis to hold sideways mine always went right.  This was not uncomfortable but a unique feeling and makes your penis noticeable under your pants/jeans etc..  I went to the store and was at the check out and the cashier was crotch shopping and once I got outside I noticed this unusual positioning sure had me exposed.  I am so glad he was able to enjoy himself and I was very happy with the great customer service.  The material is very soft and stretches around my body excellent.

I got the baby blue purse and it is a beautiful color. It is very well made with good strong stitching so you can overstuff this bag if you want without worry about the seams bursting. One thing I noted right away was the nice thick black material that lines the inside of the bag - I note this because Ive noticed that other purses Ive bought lately have really cheap and thin plasticky lining. The lining in this purse is a thick linen time material. So nice!\n\nThis purse is made of real leather - if you put your nose up against it, youll know it. The surface is gorgeous its bumpy yet soft. The purse has a decorative buckle on the front flap. I love that you don't have to deal with the buckle because the flap closes with a very well-attached magnetic snap. The magnet is strong and does not release by itself even if the purse is very full. If you want extra security, the inside has a zipper closure. The zipper is also well-attached and high-quality. The inner wall of the purse has a small zippered pocket which is perfect for stashing credit cards, money, and other small items. The outside of the purse has two pockets. There one on the front is an open pocket that is covered by the flap when closed.  On the back is a zippered pocket to allow easy access for small items such as a set of keys.\n\nI see that others have posted nice pictures, so I am just adding one more. My iPhone 5S is in the front pocket and I have a regular black pen laying in front so that you have a size reference. Its a pretty small purse, but youll be surprised by how much it will hold.\n\nThe quality and look of this purse is on par with some upscale brands. Ive had this purse for nearly two weeks and Ive chosen it over my so called designer bags quite a few times now. If you are looking for a cute little purse, you will definitely love this!  I received this product at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. All opinions are based on my own experience and observations.", "summary": "SOOO cute.

It has plenty of room for cards (two separate sections, one large one small on opposite sides), a large coin pure and room for cash and receipts.  It has two closure snaps in case the wallet is crammed full of stuff and you need extra room.  The shiny tooled leather is gorgeous and quite thick, so the wallet will wear well.  This wallet can also be used a small clutch.  It also has an outside pocket for those items you want to keep within easy reach.  It has a clear window for a driver's license as well.  The Amazon price is much less than I paid in a department store ($190).  The quality of the leather is great and on par with Coach or other mid price brand.  I really like this wallet and will enjoy using it for years to come.  If you want a retro style wallet that's a bit off the beaten path, you can't do better than this Patricia Nash style.  I'm impressed by the quality, which I would have expected from a much more pricey brand but not one so reasonably priced.  This wallet will last for years and will likely not show wear at all.  It's the perfect size for all my myriad stuff and it's easy to find exactly what I need.  I highly recommend it.", "summary": "Great form and function", "unixReviewTime": 1464566400}

It's beautiful enough to be worn without adding any charms at all, but it does have the same diameter as a Pandora bracelet, so any charm that fit a Pandora bracelet will fit this one as well, and unlike a plain sterling silver bracelet, this one won't ever tarnish.\n\nTo open the clasp, you push your nail into the crack on the sparkling snap clasp bead, and it pops right open. I keep my nails on the shorter side, so this isn't a problem for me. Once you add beads to your bracelet be sure to add a bead stopper or a clip charm to keep your beads from dropping off when you open the bracelet. To close the bracelet again just insert the end and push the clasp back together over the end, but don't stop until you hear it click shut. Once it has clicked shut it is very secure and even tugging on the bracelet won't make it pop open.", "summary": "Platinum plated so it won't ever tarnish", "unixReviewTime": 1473811200}

The buckle is a hard painted PVC. I was not satisfied with the overall product and will return.\n\nThe $55 holster was higher in quality and had the greeble holders and I could fit both blasters easily. The buckle is metal.\n\nI'm a 38\" waist and the $55 holster fit with one hole to spare and the leg straps were long enough to all me to secure.\n\nHope this helps others!

M Lace Halter Strappy Sexy Lingerie Backless Low Cut One Piece Nighty</a>\n\nPut this little number on and get ready!!! This strappy sexy lingerie needs no introduction. When you first look at you will probably say it's nothing to it. But it is all in the eye of the beholder. I am 5'7 and 170lbs so no matter what size you are, it can be adjusted by the straps to be tighten or loosen up.\n\nThis little number is very lite weight but the detail is beautiful. You may not be able to tell from the pictures so please watch the video. The color is a pink or some may look at it as burnt orange and has lace all the way thru it. It has satin ribbon for all the straps, then a few of them has feathers on the ends for details. I t it cut as a thong in the rear and the lingerie is all one piece. You just tie all the straps together to make work. Really it looks confusing but it easier than you think.\n\nThe satin material feels so nice on your skin and even better when your partner will touch you with it on. Since it is so delicate i will be had washing it with a very light laundry detergent and hang to dry. Just so it will last a little longer. I really do think it's perfect for a bride, birthday present for you and your partner or a great.\n\n*I received this at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review, this is my 100% honest opinion after testing the product*", "summary": "IT'S ON TONIGHT!!!", "unixReviewTime": 1463011200}

The lace was so soft and not scratchy at all which I have found to be the case at times with other products. The main ribbons for the top and the bottom sides are nice and long to accommodate most anybody, and there are cute feather accents at the ends of those. The other two sets of strings at the top half are long as well but also have some elasticity to them, which is nice as this helps you make them a little tighter if you have larger breasts that need the support.\nOverall, the quality of this is great and will boost your confidence to make you feel sexy!\n\n*I received this at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased review, this is my 100% honest opinion after testing the product*", "summary": "Super sexy and comfortable", "unixReviewTime": 1462147200}

This product is in no way a knock off mind you, I cant even say which came first (it doesn't matter but I think the miansai one did). the difference though is in the QUALITY and CRAFTSMANSHIP. this cuff is gold plated. fine. the plating comes off pretty quickly, and that not a huge deal, thats what happens with plated jewelry. One big problem however is when the \"stainless steel\" underneath starts rusting. I know where are different grades of stainless and all but I expected better stainless then this. the cuff itself, (the horseshoe shape and threaded pin) are very thick. I can not say that I felt that this product was comfortable, as it was heavy, thick, cumbersome, and tight. if the thickness of the bracelet was thinner it would have fit better. if it was thinner, maybe they could have sprung for better stainless. I am a large 6'5\" man and for me to think that this thing looked too thick/chunky and was too tight might not mean the same thing to you, and maybe you just want this as a costume piece for the occasional going out. maybe the small or medium size are more appropriately proportioned.

M. V. Vooren", "reviewText": "I was really anticipating the arrival of this monokini, and now that it finally arrived, after twenty days, I could not be more disappointed with this item.\nHere is the list of grievances:\nThe monokini is crocheted from one end to the other, which makes it see-through everywhere, including the hiney and the boobs.  There is only a small piece of double-up right at the crotch area.\nThe butt cheeks don't fit into the pants part, as about 2 inches of my crack are sticking out, no matter how I try to pull up on it. Looking at the picture where the model shows her back side, you can see how she pulled the panties into her butt, way up to manage to cover the crack. I am not into wedgies, so that would not be a viable option for me.\nThe boobs are not supported at all, as the brassiere part is just knitted, not shaped. The padding insert is off-white, not black, which would make it look better. One can see the padding through the knitwear. Also, this model on the pic must have boobs made in Siliconia, as they stand up like no natural breast of that size ever would. So, if you have natural breasts, expect them to slide out of the cups, unless you tie that thin string underneath so fast in the back that you can't breathe well anymore. I am a cup C size, and the cups of the one I got are barely covering up, they are about one third smaller than shown in this picture.\nThe middle part is crocheted so loosely that it can pull out to double its length without much effort. I suspect that in the water, it will stretch out even more! (I did not want to make it wet, so I did not test this, but I'm willing to take a gamble on this hypothesis, lol).\nI could imagine that this concept might work, if they had made the top and bottom of regular swimwear material, and only made the middle part in crochet.\nThe tie strings around the neck and in the back are just a very thin crochet cord, and the ends are already fraying. These will unravel in no time. And because they are so thin, they cut especially into the neck, and just a little less in the back. I can only imagine that this will get worse when the skin gets wet and softens up. Chafing is waiting to happen!  I added a pic of the frayed end of the tie cord. The other three ends look just like this one. On the second pic, I also am showing how you can see my fingers through the knitwear on the butt area.\nThe swim suit is going back as soon as I get the label printed.

Fully lined with a built-in bra makes the dress a little stiff in the bodice, but it would be easy to sacrifice a little comfort to not have to wear a bra.\n\nThe sizing runs a little smaller than posted on the site since these are made in China (I didn't realize that when I ordered).  Make SURE you communicate with the Seller at the time of your order.  They will custom make a dress for you if you send them your measurements on their form.  Unfortunately I did not realize this when I ordered and so I ordered two different sizes (16 & 18W).  The \"stock\" sizes arrived and they were WAY too small.\n\nAfter communicating with the Seller, I opted to return the dresses at my cost ($50!!).  They did suggest to have someone in the US alter the dresses,  however because they were too small, it was not worth the additional cost.\n\nBottom line?  Seller worked well with me regarding the return/credit and the quality of the dress was very good.\nLesson Learned?  Check the country of Origin (where it's coming from), return policy and ask the Seller if they take your measurements.", "summary": "Good quality; affordable price; Seller communicates timely - Ultimately Returned/Too Small", "unixReviewTime": 1465948800}

However, the dress came with only a tag saying \"XL\"--no brand name, listing of what the fabric is, or care instructions.  The product description says, \"Material :cotton blend,soft,stretch,\" but there is no stretch to the fabric at all and it feels like a rough unwashed linen or possibly even a potato sack.  Washing it once in a delicates bag and hanging it to dry did not make the fabric any softer.  There are also a bunch of loose threads that I had to chop off.\n\nThat said, I decided to keep the dress as I have not seen another with quite the same cut or that will fit over my frame (currently 98cm, 94 cm, 104cm, shoulders 37cm) - usually US size 10 in tops and 12-14 in bottoms.  The length of the dress varies; I like to wear the dress with leggings shorts underneath for modesty at work as it falls mid thigh (I'm 5'7).\n\nA great thing about the dress is that it can also be worn just as a button shirt as it unbuttons all the way down.

It was a bit wrinkled when it arrived but all it needed was a hangar and a few spritzes of water to smooth it out overnight.\n\nI usually don't wear tops with peek-a-boo shoulders but this one actually looks really nice and has longer sides than front, which I like better than hi-low styles. I noticed another reviewer received one that was thin enough to need something under it but the one I received is a nice decent weight that doesnt require any type of tank top or camisole. Maybe the fabric on the other color option is slightly different.\n\nI have now machine washed my top once with other dark items using detergent for dark laundry and it looks as good as new. No fading. I did hang it on a hangar to dry and that was perfect  no wrinkles or any crinkling.  I won't be putting this in the dryer ever as I have found that dark items suffer more under high heat than lighter colored garments.\n\nWhat else can I say, its a beautiful, well-made top for casual wear.\n\nRecommend.\n\nI received a free or low-cost sample in exchange for my honest review.", "summary": "Good, casual wardrobe staple item", "unixReviewTime": 1459641600}

I took out the shoulder seams and shortened the shoulder straps nearly two inches. It still hangs a bit to the right, which is irritating, but the back is adorable and the front is classy and cute and no longer a cleavage fest. Moreover, my bra doesn't show on the sides anymore.

Also there is a drawstring on the side that allows for you to pull the suit legs up or down for more of a bikini cut or a boy cut on the leg. Also the halter fit allows for more support for the chest. I think that the suit is perfectly decorative all on its own so you don't have to wear a necklace.

It fits like a glove to the top of the bust line then flows down into a traditional swing top.  The picture shows plenty of room in the arms and upper body but I did not find that to be so. As a chesty woman I found the shoulders and upper bust fit more like a leotard than a roomy shirt, but the rest of the top fit like the image in the photo. Could be just me, but I suspect the model is wearing one size larger than her usual size. If you want a looser fit order up. It has plenty of length, hitting about mid thigh and covering the rear completely.\nThe fabric is mostly rayon with some added spandex which should make the top maintain it's shape. It is thin but not sheer, but if I wear it out I am fairly certain I will wear a camisole beneath it. Also pay attention to the washing instructions.  Rayon can be a little unforgiving if cared for incorrectly\n\nI am in a quandary about this top. It looks very nice (even though it is form fitting at the very top) and I might possibly wear it during the fall, but I live in the deep south and rayon is just too hot for our muggy summer.  Maybe if we have a cool night I might be able to pull it off?  Meanwhile I think it will just hang out in my closet\n\nI received this at a discount for my honest unbiased review.

I ordered mine in pink, which is usually considered a summer color, and you don't usually see it in warmer clothes.  I also liked the tunic style and the loose fitting over the torso.\n\n  This material is a stretchy fabric - 95% rayon and 5% spandex.  It is very soft and comfortable.  The style allows the tunic to flow freely. The tunic (size medium) is 68 inches long along the back seam.  The sleeves are 42 inches long from the shoulder.

I have some other clothes made of the same combination of fabric and I always put them in the washer, so the next time I wash this, it will go in the washer and I will edit this review based on the results.\n\n  The only problem I have is with the sleeves. They are very snug. The questions and answers on this  Amazon listing said it ran larger than usual. I am 5' 3\" and 120 pounds and wear a small or medium, so I ordered the medium size. Even with a medium, I found that I have to carefully line up the seam on the sleeve to the underside of my arm.  Otherwise, it twists around the shoulder and looks bad.

It is large enough to hold everything I need for work and there are several pockets including a large double zipped pocket accessible under the outer flap (& on the inside there are two open pockets on one side and a larger zip pocket on the other & no partition). I mostly carry files and folders, maybe a small laptop--nothing too heavy or bulky. Ilike the closure (I have some bags with this type of closure that don't operate smoothly, but this one is flawless). I also appreciate the top handle, and I think the web strap shoulder handle is a great idea as I have a backpack with leather straps that tend to stretch a bit if the bag is heavily loaded. That won't happen with this one (not that I plan to overload it, anyway). I ordered this in black and the leather is smooth and glossy--very attractive and I'm happy to have found this on sale (have to admit the regular price is far out of my price range). I see it has just gone down in price a bit more, darn it--oh, well I still got a good price! I have an older more rustic looking briefcase in brown that has held up wonderfully, so I can see this more polished version lasting me for many years. This arrived wrapped in the original tissue and enclosed in plastic so it definitely seemed new, but I did not receive the little leather hang-tag that has been included with most Frye products I have purchased in the past. Maybe they are only packed with handbags? IDK, but this is just a minor consideration anyway. Also, the flannel storage bag that comes with all Frye bags is also a bit small--maybe the wrong one? as the briefcase barely fits inside, but it isn't going to be stored very often, anyway.

I was super excited when I received it in the mail and was so happy that it was covered by prime shipping so I doubted that it was coming from China with there extremely small sizing but I was very wrong. The only good thing I can say about this product is the lace is pretty. Otherwise it is way to small. There was not any underwear included so the picture is very misleading. It fit like a short tank top, it did not even cover my belly button. The wire for your breasts is misshaped and it just looked all together very unflattering. My other problem with the garment is that the \"robe\" was even shorter then the actual lingerie. The tag attached is written in Chinese, so it's definitely a product from China.  I am 5'6 and 120lbs for reference but this would not have fit well even if I was under 5 ft tall. Needless to say this did not spice up our night but did however give both my husband and I a good laugh.

Id say for the price, this garment is great for a little tummy support because the waistband doesn't really roll down, and for a bit of shape under thicker clothes.

I love these type of tank top or cami tops with the lace at the top and bottom. They are great for layering or pretty enough to wear by themselves. I own several other tops similar to this one and Mabssis definitely had some good things about it and some things that could be improved.\n\nFirst, the color of the top I got in gorgeous. I did not have one in this color and that is why I selected it. It is bright and pretty and unique. The picture definitely represents the actual color of the top. The top is long which is definitely a plus. You can wear it so many different ways and having the extra length looks really good. The lace is pretty and adds a nice touch to the top. It seems well made and I hope to get a lot of use out of it.\n\nThere are a few negatives to the top though. For one, the adjustment part on the straps is in the front instead of in the back. On most tops I own, the adjustment is in the back where you can not see it. On this however, it is right there in the front. Now, if you are wearing this underneath something, that is no big deal and probably makes it easier to adjust. However, if you want to wear this by itself, the adjuster piece is right there in the front. For me, that just is not very attractive. I would much prefer it in the back. Also, the fabric is very thin and see through. You have to be very careful what you wear underneath it if you do not want people to see what you have on under it. Also, the lace is very delicate and thin and I will have to be careful how I launder it.\n\nOverall, the top is very pretty and a good addition to my wardrobe.\n\nDisclaimer: I received this item at a discount or for free in exchange for my honest review.", "summary": "Pretty top, great price", "unixReviewTime": 1467158400}

It is a beautiful shade of rose gols. I ordered it for a young girl and i am glad i did because it would be too small for my wrists so just keep that in mind when ordering this.\nI think it is a perfect bracelet for a young girl as the color, like i said it beautiful, the design is very in style, and the claso is super easy to work. A young girl would definitely be able to manage putting it on or taking off on her own with just one time of being shown how by you.\nThe bracelet is light weight but feels like it is made pretty well. It also comes in a cute velvet bag for storage when it is not being worn. I like that simple extra because it keeps it from hitting other jewelry and possibly scratching or tarnishing.\nI did receive this bracelet at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest qnd unbiased review and based on my experience with this bracelet, that is what i have provided.

It also helped that the price was pretty attractive ($8). However, I did not get what I was expecting. The item was not all bad but there was definitely reasons to be disappointed. Below are the pros and cons of this purchase.\nPros\n1. The item arrived before time.\n2. The fabric is very durable. The top is lined & padded and likewise the bikini bottom is lined. The waist of the bottom as a thick elastic waist band.\n\nCons\n1. The bottom looked nothing like the image. I have included images of the front and back. The back of the bikini bottom does not match the image for sure.\n2. The top is irregularly cut causing it to look and fit lopsided. When I put it on there was a noticeable fault and pucker under the left arm. This will have to be altered before I wear it.\n3. If you have some butt this will fit like a regular bikini bottom and will not fit like a high waist as shown in the image.\n4. There is little stretch in the fabric. This could be a pro and con. If you bought the bikini too small no amount of wash and wear could help you. However, if you bought your size it will be snuggle and could help out a not so bikini ready tummy.\n\nAll in all I'm disappointed with the faulty top and the bottom that looks nothing like the pics. The only reason I'm not returning the items is because I live outside of the US and the cost to send it back will out weigh what I actually paid for the suit :(", "summary": "Disappointed", "unixReviewTime": 1474416000}

I wear a 34DD and usually a 10 in pants. I ordered a large in hopes it would fit me perfectly. Most of the time a large does. There was maybe an inch and a half that wouldn't zip up on the lower part of the dress when I tried it on. If an XL would have been offered, I definitely would've exchanged it. Unfortunately, I had to return. I would have kept it otherwise. The only reason why I am giving it 4 stars is because an XL was unavailable.

I am also at a weight where I feel much more comfortable in a one piece.  I am 5'1\" and I wear a US size 14.  I purchased the XXXL in this suit and it fits great.  Of course, no one likes to admit that their suit is an XXXL, but I want you to be able to purchase the right size for yourself based on my US size and the size I bought.\n\nThis is a classy suit and very pretty.  I always buy boring suits and colors so I decided to do something different... I bought the red!  It is a gorgeous shade of red and I love it.  It fits comfortably and really hides any flaws and imperfections that my body has.  There is a little sheer panel, but with this color, it is pretty hard to see.\n\nI wear a bathing suit almost daily because we are in our jacuzzi nightly.  This is the kind of suit that I am going to save for when company is over.  This is too pretty to wear everyday in my jacuzzi.  I am definitely saving it for when we have guests in the jacuzzi (which is almost weekly -- so it will be used a lot).\n\nI like the one shoulder strap. This makes this bathing suit very unique. I don't have any that are even close to this style,  It looks like a very expensive suit.\n\nThe quality of the suit is superior.  It is a strong, durable material and thick... I have purchased suits in the past that are so thin and alms transparent.  There is padding in the bust but that is where my only con is... the padding would not stay put and did not hit me in the right area.  There are little slits so I was easily able to take out the padding that ended up being useless for me.  The suit is thick enough that the padding is not really needed.\n\nThis is a great suit for the money... comparable to a much more expensive suit.  Classy looking and pretty... sexy but modest. Helps to hide your imperfections (though my husband is constantly telling me I have no imperfections... he must need glasses!).\n\nPROS:\nwell-made\ndurable\ngorgeous red\nmodest but sexy\nthick fabric\n\nCONS:\npadding would not stay in correct place in bust\n\nI was selected to review this item at a discount.

The concept and design idea of this one piece swimwear is great.  That was actually what drew me toward this particular swimsuit.  The fit was a bit off.  I am a true 6-8 so I ordered a size up 10-12 per the sizing guidelines and even at a size up the fit is very tight and off.  The mesh cut outs and cup holders are off as I tried to pull it up to fit.  I was able to get into it but because the fit was small it totally takes away from the swimwear fit.  As beautiful as it is it was not flattering on me.  I did pass it along to my niece who is about 115 lbs and a size 4-6.  The swimsuit fit her perfectly and looks fabulous on her.\n\nI would indeed order another swimsuit from this line as the quality and design were great.  I would just be sure to go up 2 sizes this time.\n\nDisclaimer:  I received this product at a discounted price in return for my honest and unbiased review/opinion.", "summary": "Beautiful Swimsuit Design", "unixReviewTime": 1466208000}

The gold has discolored, which I expected. I'm not sure when. This is actually my promise ring but I do technical work, dig in the dirt planting, and I am an artist/crafter. I have never gotten paint or dirt stuck in the settings, it has never discolored my finger, I've never lost a stone, and it barely has any knicks in it. If you want a ring that stays gold, get a true gold ring, but be advised that gold is a malleable alloy and will bend and knick up easily. I've had gold rings in the past that I beat up to the point of fearing for their little metal life so I chose steel this time. If you don't lift heavy things regularly or use dremel tools you probably can get away with normal gold and little injury but if I grind on a gold ring that'll be the end of it. I wear a half size and it's perfect whether my hands swell or not. I am highly sensitive to metal and all sterling silver, silver, nickel-free, hypoallergenic alloys still make me break out. I get hives from my blue jeans and buttons but not this ring. Whenever we do get around to getting married I will likely insist upon keeping this ring as my wedding band because it's been through jewelry-hell and back. It's a perfect example of love that withstands all things and also it's a part of me now. I'm naked without it. He initially wanted to go to a jewelry store and get something pretty and expensive to which I replied with incredulous staring. We compromised here with \"well, it's cheap enough for you to destroy.\" And it turns out, it's the one thing I can't accidentally break. I'm a happy woman. If you are clumsy, rough, and generally not good at taking care of shiny things, this is the ring for you. If you need a backup or work ring you don't need to worry about, this is also the ring for you. If you want something that looks exactly like the picture for all of time, go somewhere else with more zeros on the price tag. My partner has a tungsten ring specifically so he can't destroy it and I was initially nervous about this one but it turns out, mine is just as durable, but prettier ;)", "summary": "Beautiful AND Durible.", "unixReviewTime": 1527292800}

I wore it to a gala and got endless comments and stares! Everyone loved my dress. Definitely a head turner. Looks exactly like the picture. I normally wear a 18W in dresses but I went up 2 sizes and ordered a 22. I see why people say go up 3 sizes because once you tie up the corset in the back the dress becomes extremely tight and not so easy to move in. Im a curvy girl boobs, hips, and ass. The dress is heavy and is of good quality. You definitely get your moneys worth with this buy. Im soo happy I ordered this dress. I did expedited shipping and received my dress within 3 weeks. Witch was actually pretty fast. Customer service was great, they answered all of my questions and sent me a picture of the dress before it was shipped to me as I requested. Think no further order this dress more so Say Yes to the dress lol. I recommend this dress for anyone no matter your shape/size.", "summary": "Exactly Like The Picture!", "unixReviewTime": 1513641600}

This lightweight material will be great on the hot summer days when I feel like the sun is beating on my black fabric, this dress is airy enough to feel nice.  I like the waist line in this dress, I like the perfect high waist line that still lets it flow nicely from the waist down to cover my chubs. Lol The top part of this dress is nicely fit, it does not show too much but is just perfect for a nice necklace to add a little something to the dress.\nMy favorite thing about this dress though is being able to wear it casually or you can dress it up for a night out. It is easy to add a cover up or cute jacket with if you would like. Or wear it without and great for a nice warm day.

The cups in the top aren't removable, they are sewn into the swimsuit. The cups are too large for me. If the cups were removable this would fit me better. If you're a plus size woman with a smaller chest I would pass on this swimsuit. It's made for women with larger cup sizes. If you're a cup A-C these cups will be a little too big for you.\n\nRatings (Out of five stars):\nMaterial Quality: *5*\nStitch Quality: *5*\nCup Size & Removability: *1*\nStyle: *4*\nValue: *5*\n\nOverall rating: 20 out of 25 stars / 4 Star Average\n\nSUMMARY: This is a well made comfortable swimsuit. The cups aren't removable and they are designed for cup sizes D+. If you have a smaller cup size I would pass. This suit has straight stitching, no loose threads or seams. Quality wise, this is a very well made swimsuit.\n__________________________________________________________\n\nI received this product complimentary from stripsky for quality testing purposes.

That back stand is made of cardboard and will need to be handled delicately so you don't damage it. It comes in a reusable and resealable bag for storage which is a plus to keep it clean. The pins that were enclosed are terrible though.  That is the only problem I have with it.  It felt like they were beginning to rust and several of them were bent.  However, pins are cheap enough and I will be purchasing some with black heads so that they blend into the display better and keep the focus on my jewelry.

I'm about the same size as the model shown (aside from the bust) and so I ordered the medium. Fits very well on the bottom and sits right on the waistline. Top is a tiny bit smaller than I'm comfortable with but it works, especially since the straps are wider than on most swimsuits. One thing I did not see mentioned in the description, the top does have a little bit of padding/push-up. It's also lined, has a metal clasp on the back (not adjustable) and ties at the neck.\n\nAll in all, I'm very happy with the swimsuit.

The bottoms fit perfectly. They are so cute, and everything I wanted them to be.\n\nThe top... looks better in the picture. It's a very stiff bra top with almost pointy cups that are kind of awkward and feel like they push down instead of up. If the cups were a bit more rounded, I would be able to fill them out well enough. I'm a 34C, but I can't really decide if the top is too big or too small; it just doesn't fit quite right. That probably won't stop me from wearing it, because the suit does keep me covered, and seems to keep everything secured, but if I spy a better-fitting top that matches, I definitely won't hesitate to snag it.

The bottoms of this suit are pretty awesome. They offer very modest back coverage, they come up nice and high, and they don't cut around the legs.\n\nThe top, however, is not at all my favorite. The cups sit low and SUPER wide. I'm including a pic of a top view. The cups push back in at the top of the cup and then the halter material extends up behind that. Even if you try to get some lift or push-up, anything you accomplish is thwarted by how the cup pushes back in and pancakes you. It does have a nice metal clasp in the back but that's about all it has going for it, for me at least.\n\nThe suit came in a nice zippered bikini bag with handle which was an unexpected surprise.\n\nThe material is very nice and high quality. The white polka dots are NOT see through which is awesome.... you run in to that problem with cheaper quality suits.\n\nI'll keep this suit because I love how supportive and full coverage the bottoms are.

Made good and fits really well. I got this for me or my daughter and she loves it , it is not very snug on her but yet its good for her age. Shes very tall for her age over 5 ft and weighs 110. The padding in the cups can be removed if need be by making a small slit in the sides just like any exercise bra has and then just stich up the slits. This might be slightly big if you want a really snug fit but I did our measurements by the chart and went with that.  Polyester and spandex. This material is really made well and the stitching is excellent. Emojis are the thing now and this will be a big hit during vacation. The shorts come to the belly button and the wide waist strip is very flattering and comfy. These could be used as exercise shorts for her tumble class also with a tank top. The top as well would look good with leggings for tumble class or hip hop. Versatile wear in my opinion. I have dearlovers down on my list for swim wear because im honestly impressed with how it is made and im really hard to please when it comes to bottoms of a swimsuit.

Main compartment has movable bottom to keep the bottom flat, and can flipped up so that bag can be collapsed.  There's a divider inside the bag for note pads and small items.  Front zippered pocket would be perfect for wallets and permission slips.  Straps work well, with mesh to allow a bit of breathing, including the back of the bag.  These bags have pockets on the sides, perfect for water bottles and juice boxes.  Overall, these bags are well put together and seem to be very high quality.  Due to relatively thick material instead of thin canvas, bags should last.  Sewn-in name tag on the back of the bag is a very nice touch.\n\nThese bags are very nicely made, doesn't have strong odors, and functional with many compartments.

I would say somewhat on the small size since I have other small mens shirts that fit me a lot looser.  This one is a little tight.  Still fits, but a bit smaller than what I expected.  Not horrible tho.  I am probably going to give this shirt to my nephew who is also a doctor who fan as I think it will fit him better.  But aside from that, i am very satisfied with the shirt and would def purchase more.", "summary": "Good quality a tad bit on the small side", "unixReviewTime": 1458864000}

I would not be at all surprised if it turned out that the same company made both and just put it in different boxes - after all, both are made in China. I don't know if this statement is true, it is speculation on my part. So if you are buying this as a gift for someone who really cares about the Ollivander's box, then go with the official version. But if you are buying this to display on a wand stand, this is a good choice. I purchased this at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.  I was able to talk to the vendor and found the vendor very responsive. I bought two other wands from this vendor - Fred Weasley and Narcissa Malfoy wands - I am happy with all. The 5 stars is for the quality of the wand compared to the official version and for the vendor responsiveness. I didn't detract anything for the packaging because it is a nice box with padded lining to protect the wand. It just is not the Ollivanders box.", "summary": "Looks exactly like the pictures", "unixReviewTime": 1460332800}

Aside from the fact that there is obviously a very serious Harry Potter obsession in my household and we need another hobby other than spellcasting and wizard duels, the reason I have repeatedly bought from this vendor is due to the customer service.\n\nAll of the wands that I received were of high quality. There was one that I got which was obviously of substandard quality. I reached out to the seller and shared my concern. T. Vanko responded within 24 hours and the wand was replaced free of charge . The replacement wand was of the same high quality as the others, so I suspect that they had a quality issue which was soon addressed.\n\nThis Death Eaters wand in particular resonates more with me than with other members of my household because I was sorted into the Slytherin house. Borgin and Burkes is my favorite store in Knockturn Alley.\n\nMany of the comments I made in reviews of other Vankos wands apply to this one as well, so for ease of reference I will paste it below:\nI find myself in Orlando, FL on a fairly frequent basis and I was able to do a side-by-side comparison of this Death Eaters wand compared to the official version sold in the Universal Studios theme park.\n\nPROS:\n* Out of the box, it is almost impossible to tell which one is the official version. They appear to be virtually identical.\n* This wand comes in a nice padded box that protects it from being easily damaged. The box is of gift quality.\n* This brand is cheaper than the official version available at Universal Studios.\n\nCONS:\n* The box is nice, but it is obviously not the real thing. There are Chinese characters on it that is a clear indicator this is not the official version. The marketing on the box is a little off. The box does not have the ribbon in it that the official wands have and it does not match what is shown in the movie.\n* This is not an interactive wand that can be used to cast spells at the Universal Studios park. But, it was not marketed as such and therefore I cannot fault the manufacturer for this.\n\nOverall, this is a great alternative to the official version of the Death Eaters wand.  I had an opportunity to purchase this at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.", "summary": "Repeat customer", "unixReviewTime": 1464393600}

I think the wand in the picture looked like it was better detailed than the wand I received. Everyone here in my household is impressed with this wand (maybe I'm just picky). I think he will still absolutely love it though. It is not too light or too heavy. This is a high quality, weighty resin replica of the actual movie prop. It is comfortable to hold. It is made of resin and seems to be fairly durable. The box it came in is nicely designed and sturdy, not cheaply packaged. It has a pretty gold silky lining inside. It will make a great costume accessory if he chooses to use it that way. I cannot wait to see his reaction to this wand. I truly hope he loves it.\n**Update- He LOVED it!

I read about the sizing and according to people's opinions, I ordered a much larger size than I would have if based on US sizing, (in bathing suits, roughly a 10-12. I've always had to go larger on bathing suits.) However, it actually was a bit big on me underneath, where there's a mesh one piece layer. I wasn't tall enough to stop it from bunching up. I ordered a 4XL which sounds very big, but Asian sizing runs small. However, I think I over compensated in ordering a 4XL based on some reviews I read. I would have been better off with perhaps an XL. I'm not sure. Bathing suits are tough to order online and I wish I sized this right because I love it!  I found the chest area lacking in support but that's because I ordered too big. There are cup liners- a feature I love in case you're cold. There's no risk of show through. The halter neckline allows you to adjust the bathing suit and is very comfortable. I think the fabric is quality. It feels great to the touch, (very smooth- not rough or cheap feeling in the least). I love the retro look of the Angerella Womens Navy Stripe One Piece Swimsuit Bathing Suit. If I order another, I'll be sure to go a size or two smaller. In clothing I wear a Medium, sometimes Large on top depending on the cut, (I tend to wear thing a bit too big). In pants I'm typically an 8, but sometimes have to go into a 10 if they're jeans- again, depending on the cut. If you look at the sizing chart for this bathing suit, it's based on US sizing. I did my research and made an educated guess. Please keep that in mind when ordering. If you get the size right, I think you'll be very pleased with this adorable suit!  All in all, I think this is a great bathing suit at a very reasonable price. Too bad I sized it wrong!

The sizes are either measured in \"Little Person\" or \"Pre-teen\" sizing. No adult female is likely to fit in a \"Large\". If the sizing is accurate, perhaps 0.01% of the American adult female population, specifically those who are small in chest, thin in build, and vertically challenged, might fit a size \"XL\". The average petite woman, which already is a tiny percentage of society, might get away with an XXL.\n\nI pity the man that buys his petite girlfriend, wife, mistress, or casual friend a size \"XXL\". Perhaps there are places in America where that would be laughed off or survivable. Here in the south, buying the mother of your children, who has maintained an incredible figure in spite of being a wonderful cook and a busy professional, an \"XXL\" swimsuit is an easy way to find yourself in small pieces on a hog farm.\n\nThis product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. Even so, I do my best to be fair and honest in my reviews. As you can see from my profile, not every item gets five stars, and I bring up shortcomings in items as I find them.

My first purchase was a dress that was completely huge and oddly fitting -- despite all the warnings that this brand runs two sizes small. This one fits amazingly. It is definitely made for smaller women with high waists and hourglass figures. If you've been struggling to find clothing sized small enough for you, this one is worth a try. I'm 5'1\" and 105-110 pounds and I ordered a size small.\nThe material is a thick synthetic stretch with a smooth, polished finish and matte texture. It covers bulges in the body well. I ordered the green, and it is a beautiful, rich blue-green. The neckline is neatly pleated in the design shown, which has a pleasing sophistication. The skirt is a few inches below the knee on my 5'1\" body. I found the sleeves to be a bit too loose, and probably the shoulder area also, but this has been the case for me on dresses from most brands.\nThe back zipper seems to work fine. The back of the dress is very plain, but it does have pleats which allow it to follow the curvature of your rear and hips better.\n\nVery satisfied with this purchase!", "summary": "Great fitting dress for small women with high waists", "unixReviewTime": 1516924800}

I am going to re-sew thecloops lower and just tie a single loop bow rather than a double loop one. I purchased a nightgown with matching lace and they go beautifully together.\n\nThe fabric is a little stiffer than the batiste that is often used I. These sorts of gowns but it is not u comfortable. I don't know how it will be for the long haul but now it has a slightly crisp and smooth hand. While it is not for outdoor wear, it is far more modest than batiste.

It's a lot better than what I expected because I've bought so many before and have been disappointed.

I love that it comes with 3 sets of clasp so you can adjust when you need to.

I can adjust where the trainer sits on my stomach. I wear thisout to the store and you really cant tell I have it on.

I ordered Size: 5XL-US22-24W which was sizing up once for Asian sizes. I wish I had sized up twice instead of just once. You definitely want to size up at least twice! I wore the shorts but because they were too small they required constant readjustment and it was just a really uncomfortable experience. Another issue I had was that I ordered the Color: Green but received Color: Viridis. I like the Viridis color better but if I were purchasing this I'd be upset about received the wrong color. I removed one star for the poor fit and the 2nd star for received the wrong color.\n\nThe top did fit but it was  pretty form fitting. I like that it has adjustable straps with a buckle slider. This top does have large pads removable pads. I really like this feature.\n\n SUMMARY: I have no quality issues with this swimsuit. It's well made with no loose threads or seams. The stitching is straight. The material and elastic both have the appropriate give. You need to size up twice for this to fit. I received the wrong color.\n__________________________________________________________\n\nI received this product complimentary from Ilishop for quality testing purposes.

I know the description says that its leather and I don't know enough about leather to really state whether it is one way or another, but I can tell you its adorable and its perfect for when you don't want to carry around a big purse.\n\nI love the hot pink color I received and the little studded design on the exterior.  I have another wristlet thats pretty plain in design and I definitely prefer this one; I just think its cuter than my other one and its perfect for a night out with the girls.\n\nThe zippers all work flawlessly which is excellent.  Ive received more than my share of wallets, purses, etcwhere the zippers don't work right.  The inside is a nice brown material that complements the exterior as well.  Theres plenty of room for essentials.  I can easily fit my phone, license, credit cards, cash, my lighter, cigarettes, a lip gloss or two, and still have some room.  Obviously the more you put in it, the bigger its going to be size wise but it is rather roomy for a wristlet.  The strap is removable as well so I could easily use this as a little makeup pouch in my purse too.  I think its a cute wristlet thats well-made and definitely serves its purpose.\n\nI received this product for free in exchange for my honest, unbiased opinion.", "summary": "So cute, love the studded design!", "unixReviewTime": 1465603200}

I can never be quite sure how or if, it's going to turn out okay. This was just another gamble I took and luckily it worked out well for us. My husband is extremely frugal and he wears clothes (including socks...oh and shoes), until they're all full of holes and barely hanging together by a thread. It's not like he can't afford to buy himself things, but he just seems to be scared to spend money. I guess it's a good thing I don't have those issues and we balance each other out. I was given a 50% off discount for these shorts, in return for my leaving a fair and unbiased, honest review. So after checking and rechecking the size chart, I decided to choose the 5XL for him. To be honest, I had never thought about how tiny Asian sizes are compared to U.S. and I'd never thought I'd ever have to order a 5XL for my husband. When the shorts arrived, we had a big laugh over it, and even funnier, was that they still looked like they were too small. In fact, they looked like something I could fit and I normally wear a Women's size Small. We pulled the drawstring waistband as wide open as they'd go and he tried them on and they actually fit! I mean, they fit perfectly! Of course, because these are rather long and fit baggy, you can wear it wherever you want the waistband to rest....whether right on the waist or further down. The inseam on the 5XL (size US Large equivalent) is 10\" and the leg from waistband to hem is 22\" and has a slit at the bottom. The waistband is pretty wide at 2.25\" and has 3 strong and sturdy elastic bands, with a white cotton drawstring cord in the middle one. These shorts are well constructed and the outer fabric is a soft meshed Nylon like material. There's also a really nice breathable, inner fabric lining. On top of everything else, there are 2 large side pockets! I like these so much, I'm going to buy myself a pair in another size and color. I chose the Bright Yellow with Black for him, because those are the colors of his favorite school (iowa Hawkeyes). There are actually 10 colors to pick from, in 7 sizes.

He wears a tie everyday for work, so different colors and patterns are necessary. This tie is a bit wider in width than he normally wears, but he has also been wanting one the has a little more width, just to test it out, see how he likes it, and how it looks on him. The deep purple color is pretty nice. it is a shiny purple color, without much of a design or pattern to it- but that also means that it will match that many more outfits. The plain purple color will also coordinate better with many other outfits than normal. The length is perfectly fine, and he is a taller guy. This tie also includes the band on the underside for threading the loose end to once it is tied. That is feature that you do not normally get unless you get the expensive ties. It really does look pretty good on him. If you are looking for a skinny tie, this is probably not the way to go, initially. It is a good product for the value. The material of the tie is silky, as the description implies. It arrives in perfect condition, without any problems at all. I have not washed it yet, but it will either need to be washed gently by hand, or taken to the dry cleaners. That is usually done a couple times a year, and all at once.

The toe-ring was meant to be worn during an informal social event (AKA Beer n BBQ Tail Gate Party) in warm Texas weather\n\nThis toe ring arrived within a respectable amount of time given its overseas shipping point of origin.  It was packed in a box with a few other times and was packed separately in a small baggy.  The toe ring arrived intact and unblemished.\n\nOur first impression of the item was that it was delicate and easy to break.  We found it to be surprisingly sturdy and flexible when opened and closed.  The stones, which accent the butterfly shapes, shined nicely under normal light conditions.  The butterflies were clearly distinguishable when worn and viewed from a meter away.  Any further and they were just bright spots, which was just fine. The look of the toe ring was just what we were looking for.  It looks great in shoes or barefoot.  Oh and one last thing: put the toe-ring on after you have donned your shoe because the butterflies, which are fairly thick, can get snagged on straps and pinch your toe.\n\nWe did not contact customer service because the toe ring was exactly what we had ordered.  So far, we have no complaints with it and we will buy this item again if/when it breaks.  If you are looking for a cute, shiny and affordable toe-ring; get this one and be happy!\n\nAs always using Amazon to shop is great because you have a wealth of information and images to make informed decisions from the safety of your own home.  Similarly, they make addressing issues which require replacements or refunds, a breeze to deal with.  Especially when you live two miles from a shipping point, like we do.", "summary": "Cute, shiny & affordable", "unixReviewTime": 1477267200}

These are the perfect size and exactly what I want.  I love the fun colors so I can change them with my outfit.  My only issue is that the nose stud I currently have is shorter and thicker than these.  I don't want my piercing to close or get tighter so I will alternate still and change them out to keep the hole at the bigger size.  The picture posted shows the differences (right stud is my current, left is the new stud).  I also like the shorter ones because in the past, if I hit my nose, the shaft is less likely to puncture my nose and bleed.  But the longer shaft is okay and not a deal breaker.\n\nDont be scared off by the picture of the girl on this, they are not nearly so big. And a pet peeve of mine.check the spelling on your products: SURGLCAL is not a word (picture).\n\nOverall, Im happy with this and look forward to changing them out.  This is probably more than I would ever need but happy that I get the choice.  Its also nice and compact so I can carry them with me when I travel.  I also don't have to worry about losing them because I can just stick them in the foam material.  Thanks!\n\nI received this product at a discount for my honest, unbiased review.

I love the colors of the one I got, black and green. It fits my style perfectly and is different than the other swimming suits that I own.\n\nThe v in the front is rather low so you need to be comfortable showing off a little skin while wearing this swimsuit. The skirt is super cute and helps cover up your but and hips if that is something you want to do. It is held up with ties at the neck and back so be careful if you have children or friend that like to untie things :)!\n\nThe only think I did not like about the swimsuit is that the padding in the breast area was a little off and too thick. It made getting the fit a little difficult. I will wear this swimsuit, but I just wish that the area was improved.\n\nI was given a discount on this product to provide an honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Fun in the Sun!", "unixReviewTime": 1459468800}

(I ended up keeping it because my mom said she could alter it) Now...size issue aside, the material is very heavy and the dress doesn't seem to be cheaply made. The lace is thick and the pattern is beautiful. The belt adds a little sparkle and makes the dress look flawless! I also bought a petticoat to go underneath because without it looks a little flat.

So when I ran across these earrings I just had to have them! The construction of the earring is nicely crafted. You basically get a small stud attached to a rose gold plated chain. On the other end is a iridescent pearl that is flawlessly attached to the chain. The pearl is actually a little bit bigger than I expected which was great. They are not overly heavy in the year but you need to push the back on the earring closely to the ear to keep them from pulling downward. I almost wish the stud was just a little bit bigger because when the back is tighter on my ear it kind of wants to pull through my ear a little. I almost think if you have one of the disc type backs it might would sit up on the ear better. The only other thing that I ran into with these earrings is that the chain seems to kink. The kinks keep the chain from hanging straight. I don't know if can be helped because of the type of chain. Overall I am very pleased with the earrings. They will go with almost anything from casual to formal. I did receive this product at discount for a honest review. This is 100% my personal opinion based on my experience with the product.\n\nThese earrings are super cute! What I love the most about them is you could wear them with just about anything.

They were taken not for reviewing purposes in mind. Some are screenshots of a video my friend sent to a bridesmaid who lives long distance. I sadly don't have an option to upload the video via mobile app. Okay, now onto the review!\n\nShipment: It got to me in the two day mark (Amazon Prime). Warning! The package will be a lot smaller and lighter than you would think. It came with a jeweled belt/sash and some sort of bag. (I won't be using the bag included as a garment bag. It's way too small.)\n\nSizing: I am normally a size 6-8 in dresses depending on the store and cut of the dress. After reading someone's suggestion to order a size up, I did, and I am so glad that I did. I got a size 10 and it barely fit me. If it was any smaller, my butt wouldn't have slipped in the dress comfortably. Also, I am 5'7 in height without shoes. You will need to wear heels to make up for the extra length at the bottom. I suggesting maybe 2-3 inches if you're my height.\n\nPutting this on: If you have a more curvaceous bottom, step into the dress versus putting this over you. The bottom is made more slim (the mermaid style), and putting it over your head  would cause the dress to suffocate you. (Lesson learned first hand, lol!)\n\nHow it looks: Let me say this first, there are two visible seams running down the front. If I was a more financially blessed individual, I would have immediately returned this. Due to the price, I can't say that I'm surprised. Items made in China tend to look different than what's modeled in the stock photo. It's a huge problem and that's very sad. On a positive note, this fits my body perfectly. Anything smaller, anything bigger, and I would have been doomed.\n\nMaterial: This is a very cheap material. It's super light and thin. You would need to be careful of what kind of spanx and dress slip you would wear underneath. The seams may show through.\n\nSuggestions to buyers: Buy this if you're on a budget. It doesn't look bad and it'll do for the one hour wedding ceremony. Buy those sticky bras to help you lift your \"girls\" if you're a B cup like myself. Moreover, your thighs will be together while you walk. Wear spanx that has shorts at the bottom to prevent chaffing.\n\nMessage to the Seller: Please provide your own photos when selling something. Therefore it leaves little room for misleading the customer. The two visible seams in the front are not acceptable. Unfortunately (or fortunately), you caught someone like myself in a conundrum because of how well it fits and how inexpensive it is.", "summary": "Let me break this down for you.", "unixReviewTime": 1476403200}

These nose rings are a great value because they do have a flat head on the end so it won't be falling out, so that is a bonus! They are not cheaply made at all. I have the silver one in now and will wear the black with my Harley gear this summer. I do think these are little thicker than the post I had in and a little bigger than I thought they would be, but I have nothing to compare that to as I went from a stud to these rings.

I read a lot of other MUXILOVE swimsuit rewiews and decided to size up and get a large. The large seems to fit me pretty well for bottoms, but as you can image the top is a little big, but it works.\n\nColor: The color in the picture shown by MUXILOVE seems to be a light pink. When I got it, it was more of neon pink. I don't really mind this, but you should keep this in mind if you are getting the pink swimsuit.\n\nQuality: The neoprene seems to be good quality for the most part. I do not have a real Triangl swimsuit, so I'm not able to compare.\n\nOne very important thing is to make sure you're buying it from MUXILOVE-US or MUXILOVE. When you're buying it, it should say Shipped and Sold by MUXILOVE- US.

It is high density waterproof nylon travel wallet that zips closed; it has a detachable hand strap and it is light weight and easy to carry in hand, on wrist, in purse or suitcase, etc.  There are 4 inside compartments (1 has a zipper), 1 outside pocket, 6 bank card pockets and a pen holder.\nEasily holds several documents; multiple passports, IDs, credit/debit cards, cash, several normal sized sheets of paper folded in half, smartphone, planner, a pen, and still had room for more. The inside zippered section is where I kept the cash and anything that I didn't want lose in the pouch. It is extremely helpful for traveling and organization; I think staying organized while traveling is difficult and this is a life saver for me. I did carry it while there was a torrential down pour and I am extremely happy to report that the rain did not seep through or get anything on the inside wet.\n\nI absolutely recommend this pouch to anyone looking for a safe, convenient, waterproof way of carrying important documents and such while on the go.\n\nIf my review was helpful to you, please vote, yes.

The loop handle is quite convenient in case I have to carry it separately and hold my daughter at the same time. The Clutch is well made and the fabric is nice. It is lined to make it waterproof and this is very beneficial when carrying important papers that are hard to replace quickly. I has a pocket on the outside and inside it has a pen holder, a zippered pocket and an open pocket on one side and a couple on the other side, and a place for credit/ID cards. The colors they come in are nice. I ordered the pink one for my daughter's papers. I do not expect to be able to travel anywhere outside the USA. But might have to hurry and take off if we have to evacuate for a hurricane. In this case I needed something ready with our papers and info in it. With my daughter's being pink and mine a different color, it will be easy to know which is which and can grab and throw into our bug out bags. This Travel Clutch is great for keeping me organized. I have her birth certificate, insurance card, shot records, emergency numbers and contacts, and other important papers for her all in one place. I have this in the locked file cabinet, but now it is easy to grab and go for an important appointment or for bugging out(because we never know with hurricanes).

Used it most when we were at the airport fighting our way through security. Normally, I would have my wallet in my left jean pocket, keys in my right, and smartphone in my back pocket. On top of that, drivers license and boarding ticket in hand. Then I would end up having to empty all that out into the plastic bins to run through the x-ray machine.. just to pick it all back up and dig them bag into my various pockets.\nOnce we got to the airport, I put everything I immediately needed on hand into this pouch. As we were herded through security, I just dropped it into the bin and picked it back up again. So easy.\nIt looks very casual  Im not one to be wearing suits all the time. So, for me it works. It helps organize a lot when travelling. The strap is a little tight for my wrist, probably because Im a guy. I got the blue one and the color is exactly how it looks in the Amazon pictures. I like the red accents.\n*Some of the colors may be off in the pictures because of the lighting. The blue is accurately portrayed in the Amazon pictures.\n\nQuality:\nThe build quality/material is pretty good. Its made of waterproof nylon. I would say, it would works pretty good against rain, just don't completely submerge it. The one I received didn't have a lot of loose threads or didn't seem like it would get caught on anything and tear. Inside pockets and mesh come in very handy, especially if you're like me and you love having lots of pockets. You can really fit a lot into this, passports, cards, smartphones, slim planners and it even has a pen loop.\n\nPROS:\n-Lots of pockets\n-Waterproof material\n-Wrist strap\n\nCONS:\n-None to mention at this time\n\nConclusion:\nGood quality travel pouch with LOTS of pockets\n\n---ORANGE---\n(written by my wife)\nTravelus bag (5/5)\n\nOverall: I purchased a product from Travelus before and it is great. And here I am with another product!!! Its in pumpkin or orange-ish copper color: well made and doesnt feel cheap at all.\n\nPros:\nThe fabric is great. Water droplets stay on for some time on the surface, so you can simply shake off the bag to remove the liquid (if something spilled or just rain). Unless its submerged under water, I don't think it will get wet easily.\nMany inside pockets of different sizes: there are big mesh pockets on both sides, showing whats inside, and a zipper compartment for double security.\nTheres a half-pocket on the outside for an easy access (good for receipts and tickets).\n\nCons:\nWristband is hooked to the zipper; so if the bag gets caught, the zipper might break apart or open up the bag. I haven't tried pulling the wristband hard from the zipper, but its made of steel, so it shouldnt be a major problem.", "summary": "Neat little travel pouch to carry most essentials", "unixReviewTime": 1463529600}

This clutch is the definition of convenient organization. There are tons of compartments on the left side, right side and even a compartment in the front. I was able to easily hold four passports, a long marriage certificate (without it bending), IDs, bank cards, cash, a pen and sanitizing wipes with plenty of room to spare. It has a zipper section inside the case that is perfect for cash and other valuables. That particular compartment makes the entire clutch expandable so you can carry even more things in the case to have them handy at all times. It even has a long handle so you can hang it from a suitcase and it's still handy.\n\nPrior to this, I used a regular clutch. Every Time I was at the TSA line and boarding the plane it was a huge mess to get four people's passports and tickets out and together without frantically looking through an organized clutch and trying to grow two more hands. This makes those moments a million times easier. It is very durable and and water doesn't seep through to the stuff inside. I highly recommend this passport clutch, especially if you have problems with organization, a big family, or simply travel a lot. (Or all three! lol). It's great.

It is nice lightweight material that is soft and didn't have any smells.  I bought the purple and I would say that the photo accurately represents the color of the scarf. It is a blue toned purple which is very unique an pretty. Most purples I see lean more towards a lighter lilac color.  This purple has more of a punch.  The dye job isn't completely even but I think it gives the scarf kind of an ombre look and makes it more interesting and not flat. There is a pattern on the edges of the scarf which adds a nice feminine detail. The pattern goes around the entire scarf and it is of lace hearts. The edge detail isn't flimsy and it has held up well. Usually I worry about lace detail ripping but I don't with this scarf.  It is nicely finished around the edges.  The fabric itself hasn't snagged which is something that I worry a lot about with scarves like this.  This scarf is perfect for spring/summer and I could see myself attaching it to my bag for when it gets cooler in the evening.  It is also large enough to be used as a beach coverup.  But keep in mind that the fabric is sheer.  As an added bonus the scarf came with a cute little bracelet that I thought was a nice touch.  Overall I love the scarf and am thinking about ordering it in blue.  I also think this would make a great inexpensive gift for someone.\n\nI received this product at a discount for my honest review.", "summary": "Beautiful Scarf.

The edge of the scarf is a pretty lace with love hearts and it's kind of double layered but thin, lightweight and summery. I was really very impressed with the presentation - the seller seems to have given some thought to it and it was appreciated. It was in a plastic zip baggy and folded inside was a cool little tote bag/carrier bag (see picture) and even better there was a REALLY cute little friendship bracelet. What a delightful surprise!

But based on the material, quality of how it's sewn together, and how surprisingly flattering it is, so far it's a very good two-piece bathing suit. Good coverage and decent support and the color (green) is very true to the photograph. Shopping for bathing suits if you aren't a Sports Illustrated model is always a matter of finding something that both doesn't make you look horrible and isn't embarrassing, especially if you don't like flashing a lot of skin. This manages both for me.\n\nI did complain (a little) about how long shipping took, but the seller says they will be using a faster method in the future. Fair enough. Speed vs. shipping costs are always going to be toss up. You can always go for expedited if you need something faster.

I do no like anything close to my neck as I feel like I am choking. I miss that it has a little ring on the end for hooking into, it's just chain. I don't believe it's sterling, so depending on your skin, it may wear over time. That doesn't usually happen for me unless I wear something that isn't sterling every day for a very long period. I can't say if that would be the case here or not. It's a heavy snaky chain, and the jeweled part lays nice and flat, never twisting, which I find to be a real plus, unlike some loose pendants.

It is just so beautiful that it is one of those must see with your own eyes to truly see the  beauty of this piece. I ordered the purple scarf and it is GORGEOUS! The color is a muted tone of purple that actually looks like rose or a dark blush and you can see the swirls of dye that make this scarf so interesting and pretty. The stitching is even and well done all the way around the scarf. There is not a stitch out of place or a loose thread. This scarf is 74\"58\" and  is so large you could tie this numerous ways and have an infinite amount of looks with this one scarf. It also came with a few surprises packed inside as well, so you are not just getting the scarf, but 2 bags, 1 cloth like tote bag and 1 thick plastic zip top bag for travel or maybe to put the scarf away when not in use. There is also a handpainted porcelain necklace.\nThis is such a large scarf that I tied it as a halter dress and it fit very comfortably with room to spare. I'm 5'7\" and my measurements are 43\"bust(full)/35\" waist (natural)/45\" hips (full). This falls to the tops of my feet tied as a halter dress around my neck. You could also double it up and tie as a sarong skirt for a swimsuit coverup. There are endless fashion ideas that the size and look of this scarf would be perfect. I'm so glad I ordered this and I can see getting quite a few more! My wish is that more colors would be added so I can order them all!\nThe quality is wonderful, it is not cheap looking at all. There is no care tag or tag stating materials, but it feels like silk or at least a well made polyester. There are two tags attached written in Chinese, Japanese, or Korean that give the name of the company. I will hand wash with a delicate soap to see how that works and just hang to dry. It is soft and sheer as well as being lightweight. Perfect for all the beautiful romantic flowing boho looks for this summer! It would make a great shawl tied around your shoulders while wearing a satiny slip dress and a pair of heeled sandals...or tied at the end a discount slipped over your neck and worn as a vest over crocheted shorts and a cute camisole. That's just off the top of my head. I really don't think you will be disappointed if you are looking for a large scarf with some versatility....this would be the one to order.\nI received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

I got the blue and it is exactly like the picture. It is darker blue but the color varies around the scarf which gives it an ombre/tie dyed type of look.  The chiffon is great quality.  The item arrived with no snags and is very soft. What I love the most is that the scarf is lined around the edges with a small stitched hem.  This keeps the fabric from unraveling and gives the scarf a more high quality look. This detail is missed on so many cheaper chiffon scarves I've ordered and it is great to see it included on such a well priced item.  The item is very big! I have used this as a sheer beach cover up and it easily fits. I wear a size 8 and think it could easily fit up to a size 14-16. It is a very generously sized scarf.  Furthermore, I have tested the fabric while wet and the color has not bled.  Overall, I am so impressed. At the department store you would pay so much more for something like this.  The colors are beautiful and it is so versitle. It would make for a great traveling scarf. You can just throw this in your bag or tie it around the strap or handle.  It takes up very little space.

I am slowly coming to get used to it.\nIt is just huge!\nThe texture, when I first received it, was not as soft, and the flow not as fluid as I generally look for in a scarf.\nHaving said all that, let me tell you a little more about the scarf itself.\nI got the blue one, and the colors and shading are very nice, very well blended. The shades vary from light to mid blue, no darks here with this scarf. The pattern is sort of a subtle tie dyed look.\nThe edges of the scarf look to be rolled and stitched, about 1/16\" wide, and the stitches are even, a good job, with no loose ends that I could find.\nIt does not have a fabric content label, but I believe it is a lightweight (feather weight?) polyester.  I washed it in a garment bag in the clothes washer with no ill effect. I used the delicate cycle, with woolite, and added just a tiny bit of fabric softener. It came out a little bit softer than it was before the wash, and the edge stitching held up perfectly. I washed it alone, in case it would bleed any color, but I'm glad to say I don't believe that was an issue.\nThe colors were just as rich as they were before I washed the scarf, and I simply hung it to dry. It was a breezy day, which pulled out the few wrinkles that it picked up during the spin cycle.\nIf you wanted to, I think you could dry it on extra low by itself for a short spell, and it would come out just as well.\nOf course, you could also hand wash it, but I take the shortcuts where I can find them, especially when it comes to laundry!\nThe size of the scarf (77\" x 57\") is more the size of a sarong (I have a bunch of those) but the sheer nature of the scarf prohibits wearing as a sarong, unless, of course, you are using it as a bathing suit cover - up. It is absolutely prefect for that purpose, and I have found it to be great as a shawl, but I am still struggling to find a way to wear it as a scarf without  having it look too bulky.\nI have a ton of scarves, though, so I don't necessarily need another like I already have. I am liking this as a shawl, or a cover - up. Maybe a scarf...but I'm not quite there yet.\nI received this item at a discount, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.", "summary": "Really nice, sarong -sized scarf / shawl", "unixReviewTime": 1459814400}

This is our second spinner style ring, so I had something to compare this to.\n\nFirst off, this is a fairly masculine style ring, and what is pictured is what you get. When we got it (which took a little while, but we anticipated that), I personally put it on one of my fingers and gave it a test. The inside portion that \"spins\" actually spins around easily, much to our delight. I found myself actually enjoying wearing it and flicking my thumb on it to make it spin around and around endlessly while doing stuff (or reading something). For people with sensory needs or a need for extra stimulation while attempting to concentrate, this is actually a pretty interesting accessory to use. It makes a very faint sound while spinning, but no squeaks or annoying noises while doing so. My son loves it even better than the last one we purchased not too long ago.\n\nWhile I was spinning it around, I presumed that both the gold and black portions in the middle spun together, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that while they can indeed spin together, they are independent of each other and can be spun separately if desired. It sounds silly, but my son loves that feature about it.\n\nRegardless, the actual ring is pretty heavy-feeling and super sturdy. The patterns in the gold and black portions work very well with the silver, and looks like a unique and classy accessory for a tween/teen boy or man. My husband was impressed with it and actually wanted one for himself, too, because it looks so nice. I don't anticipate this coming apart any time soon, and overall, we all were even more impressed with this product than we anticipated. In addition to needing to order one for my husband, I actually liked the feeling of it (aside from how masculine it looked, but I did not purchase this for me) so much that I am starting to look into a more feminine version of this to order for myself. One of my son's friends (who also squirms and fidgets a lot) thought it was the most awesome ring he had ever seen and started begging his mom for one, too. It is really that \"cool\"!\n\nI received this product at a discount for an unbiased review that reflects my honest opinions about the product. I did not receive compensation, was never compelled by the seller to do anything other than review it, and I never guarantee 5 stars, ever! If I don't like the product and/or don't feel it is a good value, it certainly will not get a good rating from me. I try to be reasonably detailed in my reviews so people can make a more informed decision on whether or not the product is worth buying.", "summary": "Looks Really Nice and Fantastic For All Fidgety Males!", "unixReviewTime": 1461283200}

The pattern is good-looking, and the construction of the shirt is done with the kind of skill you would expect in a high-end dress shirt. Every seam in impeccably sewn.\n\nThen there are the details that I can never find: the solid collar lining on the color, the reversed out pocket tipping, the contrast stitching. Even the button are perfectly matched to these accents,\n\nI ended up giving the shirt to a family friend.

Most times I make purchases with the idea I want the items to last, so I opt for classical styles and I must admit, my wardrobe starts to look kind of boring. Everything starts looking alike and the difference may be same cuts but in different colors or patterns.\n\nIn comes Romwe, and they distribute both via their website and on Amazon. Buying clothes on-line can be iffy at times. You just don't know how sizing runs and certain production lines may run true to fit, while then you get a huge swing where items start then running large. Being that I was new to Romwe, I decided to play it safe and ordered one size up. Romwe differs where they list how their sizes run for each item, but I did notice where I may be a small in one version/style, I could easily jump to a medium in another style. Like with every female we run into issues where some shirts you just don't want to pop out of!\n\nI selected two items to review and now comes the Bohemian Shirt style dress in a blue toned fabric. Being that I have Prime on Amazon, I did not experience a delay in delivery. All items were in stock and shipped rather quickly. This is where I had a difficult time choosing a size that fir accordingly because of the dimensions listed.\n\nSizing (as listed on Amazon):\n\nXS: Bust:31.5 inch, Length:32 inch,Sleeve Length:22.8 inch\nS: Bust:32 inch, Length:32.5 inch,Sleeve Length:23 inch\nM: Bust:33.5 inch, Length:33 inch,Sleeve Length:23.2 inch\nL: Bust:35 inch, Length:33.5 inch,Sleeve Length:23.4 inch\n\nRetail Price Point: Via Amazon, the dress is $24.19 and free shipping if you have Prime membership.\n\nThere is no waist or hip size! I looked at the dress on-line and noticed there was not a fabric listed, so I had no idea if the dress had give or not. I figured if the dress was too tight in the chest area, a tank top could fix that.  I opted on going with a size that is more true fit on the chest, thinking it would then flow a little loose on the waist and hips, as per the style (fitting) on the model. I went with a size Small. The dress gets here and I should have gone with an X-Small! The dress is very largely cut and the dimensions listed are not a true representation. I love the style but the cut (final piece) is not sewn or like the picture, and this is the one I had higher hopes on. I call it a tarp but my Husband calls it a frock. If you have a waist, it's all lost in the shirt. The dress has pockets, creating again that replication of bunching that I had with the first dress where it was sewn. There is no light flow to the fabric, as it is 100% polyester. This means no breathable feeling when worn. I'm short, so the arms were a perfect length but because there is elastic at the ends, my elastic band is still loose around the wrist. I attribute this to going a size up even though my chest/breast area is between a 33 and 34, this dress is lose there but the sewing on the shoulders......well, it was not done evenly. The shoulder area (seam) rests on the front of my shoulders, not on the shoulders themselves. Think collarbone. The dress is closed on the front by one stitch, which cause a gap if you move in it. I will be removing the stitch to stop this from happening and altering it so a tank top shows, but not so down that my undies show. This will also fix that forward like feeling of where the seams rest. My pockets sag because that is how much fabric gathers at the hips and waist. I think if we knew the model's size (height, dimensions and waist/hip sizing because mine looks like it belongs on a large versus a small). If I ordered an extra small and the seamstress was the same one......well, the seams issues would have been the same. I wanted to love this dress but I think mine was just cut way too big on the bottom to be able to enjoy it and it look flattering on me. One thing is a little baggy for comfort/casual and another thing is so baggy that I am swimming in it.  The reason for the extra star, I can fix this dress.  I have a sewing machine and will be altering it but this is not always an option for everyone.  I also noticed by the reviews, the sizing is all over where some reviewers found the dress to fitting and some to loose.  I again attribute this to maybe this design the sewing/fitting is all over the place.  Kind of how the sleeve states 3/4 length but on the model that is not the case.  My dress also does not rest shorter on the front and longer on the back, it's just the same all around.\n\nRomwe Promo Codes\n\nSave 15% each on Qualifying items offered by ROMWE Limited when you purchase 2 or more.

Perez", "reviewText": "I was looking for an activewear bikini that didn't look to sporty (one-piece suits are usually too long in the torso for my petite and short-waisted body), and this bikini seemed to fit the bill. It didn't look like it would slip off from jumping into a waterfall. But I was terribly confused reading the reviews. Several reviewers had me believing that the XS would better fit a doll than an adult human body. Just to be safe, I ordered the suit in both XS and S.\n\nIt turned out the XS was almost a perfect fit, and for reference, I am 5' tall and 95 lbs. The top was tricky at first to figure out how to put on, because there are no clasps -- you have to pull what seem like miles of straps on over your head in a precise configuration -- but after just a minute laying it flat in front of me, I saw how it needed to be and slipped into it just fine. The bust pads are a little large and bulky, but they are removable and easy to switch out. The straps are a little long on me, so it isn't quite as snug as I'd like. And design-wise, the actual bikini top is a little different from the photo: at the front, where the straps cross over each other, there is a potential gap that gets wider the bigger the bust. IMO this doesn't look terrible, but if you had your heart set on the suit looking exactly like the photo, this may disappoint you. You could sew them together with just a few stitches if you really want to, and it wouldn't ruin a thing. I suspect that the swimsuit manufacturer was \"inspired by\" the swimsuit in the photo, because there are too many subtle differences for the swimsuit I received to be the same as the swimsuit in the photo.\n\nHere is a list of all the ways I see that the actual suit is different from the photo:\n1. The straps that go around the neck are narrower than in the photo.\n2. The crossover section at the front separates instead of overlaps.\n3. The straps aren't cut to angle as much on the body as the photo would suggest.\n4. The fabric is not as matte as the fabric in the photo.\n5. The bottoms are cut more straight / horizontal, not as curved as in the photo.\n\nAnd here are the qualities that earn this swimsuit a 5-star rating from me:\n1. It's still a well designed and decently produced product. It's not going to fall apart.\n2. It's flattering.\n3. I can sew, and am comfortable making the modification of shortening the strap using my sewing machine.\n4. For under $20, this suit is a great value.\n\nI can only chalk up some of the negative reviews to missed expectation, and I'm sorry, but that is not the suit's fault. No swimsuit will fit and flatter every body. No swimsuit will turn my body into the body of the model, so of course the suit will look different on me than it does on the model. Sizes vary from label to label, so I wouldn't assume that wearing a size Y everywhere else should automatically mean I wear a size Y in this suit (vanity sizing is out of control but that is a whole new topic). It is confusing to put on, because it is a complicated design compared to a triangle top -- and that's probably why most people like it. And to say the suit feels cheap? IT IS CHEAP IT ONLY COST $15-20!!! I don't think any of these are good reasons to trash the suit. Instead, if you read the reviews, looking for feedback from people who have similar height, weight, and measurements, you will probably get your best idea whether this is a good suit for you or not. I was glad to read the review from the gal who is 5'3\" and 95 lbs and said the XS was perfect for her. I had a feeling this would work out for me.", "summary": "Great suit for the money -- read reviews carefully, esp those from people whose measurements are similar to your", "unixReviewTime": 1475798400}

These for sure take some getting used to, but I went ahead and tried them out. As most of the reviews I have seen so far, they so feel like you're wearing a giant diaper or pad. But it gets the job done when you're going on that long bike ride. I have had some issues in the past while riding that my butt is sore and with these, I it wasn't sore at all. The padding is in the perfect spot where the seat is. I can where them discreetly under my shorts and even tho they feel to be extremely noticeable they really aren't.\n\nI would recommend these for anyone that is into riding bikes for long trips.

There was no chance as the sizing left no way to close the garment itself and even left hanging open the panels hung a couple of inches apart.\nThe colors were great and the lightweight fabric was exactly what I was looking for but right out of the package the entire right side from hip seam to arm was ripped open, it looked as if someone had tried it on and damaged it.\nOverall a very disappointing purchase and I would not recommend this to anyone unless you intend to give out to a 10 year old to play in which is what I did.", "summary": "Not worth it", "unixReviewTime": 1488672000}

I had a hard time fitting everything I need for work into this bag, which isn't much (wallet, a small umbrella, a small make-up tote, over ear headphones,  and my travel coffee mug)\n- The bag it also very long a narrow its hard to access something at the bottom of the bag once you've filled it with all of you things.\n- The handle on this bag is also so short. I can't hold this bag on my shoulder without some discomfort. It needs to be at least 6 inches longer to be more comfortable to carry.\n- Also, the handle of the bag looks and feels cheap compared to the rest of the bag.

I hate spending a lot on my sandals if I'm being honest, however--I'm willing to as long as I know what I'm getting will not only be comfortable, but also last me for a long time. My very first pair of Timberland sandals lasted me in excess of 5 years of heavy use. They would have lasted longer, but I accidentally left them in the trunk of a car I got rid of a few years back. I was REALLY upset when I finally realized my mistake, too.\n\nI have tried a few big name sandals in the meantime to see if they could match my Timberland's...namely Chaco's and Teva's--both very well-known and came with high recommendations. Chaco's just couldn't satisfy my need for comfort. I felt they were way too stiff and just plain no cushion whatsoever. They sure looked nice, though. But that is only a small portion of total satisfaction. Teva's certainly were much more comfortable, and also pretty durable as well. I felt these were my least favorite however as far as looks went. But hey, they were comfortable and durable, so I have 2 pairs of good Teva's that I still enjoy.\n\nNone of them can equal the look and durability (IMO) of real world use that I got from my Timberlands. Let me admit one more thing: my original Timberland sandals had a different sole, which provided much more cushion, and less texture for the bottoms of my feet to have to get used to. Not sure why they changed it, maybe because it added additional traction to the skin of your feet...? I dunno. I just feel that the original sole was just much more comfortable literally right out of the box. The Wakeby's require a few days of acclimating, which I must admit, did not sit well at first. However, after a 2-3 days of wearing them, my feet got used to them to the point where they felt much more comfortable. This could be a turn off for some, but I say give it a few days and you'll be as happy as I am. I DO wish they would go back to the original design that I remember and miss so much...but that could be just my personal wishes.\n\nDurability-wise, its hard to beat the Timberland design. Especially the leather version. I had a pair of them I bought last year that had nylon straps (one of which never seemed to line up for some odd reason) and the nylon just became frayed way too easily. The bottom sole however is still almost brand new looking. Not sure what they make them out of, but holy cow its durable stuff. They also provide great traction on a multitude of surfaces, whether wet or dry. A huge plus if you ask me.\n\nPlus, as far as looks go, I think they simply cannot be beat...but I also realize this is definitely subjective depending on what you look for in sandals. In my opinion, if you are looking for long-lasting and comfortable sandals that will provide you with great traction on everything from backwoods trails, to rock climbing to casual walking around waiting in line at Disneyland, Timberland is the brand to go with.

I really like having something like this skirt on hand. It is not only super comfy, but it also fits me perfectly and looks really nice. The fabric is luxurious, yet at the same time, casual. Sometimes in the Summer time, when it gets too hot to wear pants, but not hot enough to wear shorts, skirts can come in really handy. This skirt may be a bit too thick for me to wear in the Summer time, at least during the day, but for evening wear, this would definitely work. Especially if there's a nice breeze going on...not so much if it's hot, humid and there's no breeze though. I can see myself wearing this in the Fall though, for sure.\nSo, this skirt is made out of that slinky, silky kind of material, and it's not see-through thin, nor is it real thick. It drapes very nicely and I like the loose stretch, because it's not restricting or tight. There's no tight elastic waist band either, and there's plenty of give, but it stays on the waist. This skirt is made here in the U.S, in Los Angeles, so there's no having to worry about trying to convert U.S. sizes to Asian ones. I chose the size Small, which fits size 4-6 U.S. There are 7 different color & design options to choose from and it comes in 4 sizes. And because this skirt has the fold-over waistband, it can fit many different heights. I'm only 5' 3\" and the hem hits me at the ankles. I can probably make it shorter by pulling it up further if I wanted. I really like the versatility of this simple design. It can be worn with a blouse (or top) either tucked in or out, and would look nice with a wrap-around or wide belt. You can wear this dressy or casual , day or night, or from day-to-night. The possibilities are many, just let your imagination run wild.

I'm 5'3\" and the length is good  The fabric is light and, although not really see through, I will be wearing shorts underneath (which is the case for all my maxi skirts anyway).  It's definitely something I can wear to work, or more casually on the weekends.  Very versatile and comfy.\n\nI received this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.

I had another black maxi skirt that I wore all the time and I was going to a tea party themed grad party and ended up cutting it to be shorter because I lacked a slip to go under the new dress I was wearing to the party.  :-(  I was missing my black skirt so much until I found this one.\n\nI found the size that I ordered, a LARGE on point for what I normally wear.  I am 5' 4\" tall, weigh 167 and have a 33\" waist and 39\" hips.  The skirt has a lot of play as far as how long you wish to make it just by wearing it higher or rolling the waist.  I personally, wear it about hitting my waist and it hits below my ankles which I love, especially when wearing boots, which I do a lot of in the country.\n\nOn the large ... the waist measures about 30\" not stretched and the measurement from waist to hem is about 39\".\n\nThe material, drapes nicely, it feels soft and comfy to touch.  Would be great for casual or dressy occasion.  I wear my mine to services and volunteer work.  I noticed it does not seem to attract lint badly.  That is surely a plus!  We have a number of cats and looking at the skirt today, I would have to look hard to find a cat hair.\n\nWill update as to longevity if there is a flaw to be found.  At this time, there is none.

It is long enough to be ankle length on me and I am 5'7\".  It is well made with no loose threads or stitches coming out and the seams and hems are all even. The fabric seems to be high quality jersey cotton or cotton with spandex. It's soft and light, not so heavy that it weighs itself down over the course of the day and soon you feel like you are having to pull it up every 5 minutes to keep it from falling down around your feet. It is about 42\" inches long, I measured from the unfolded waist down the seam to the bottom hem of the skirt. You can play around with the length by folding or unfolding the waist and pulling it up or down on your hips. It's thin enough that if folded down at the waist several times, it would not be obvious and bulky. This could be pulled up to make a strapless midi dress that falls right below your knee or mid calf depending on your height. I have mostly worn this with tank tops and tshirts and kept it very casual, but you could pair it with a dressier top and it would look fine as well. My body shape is pear or hourglass, depending on what I wear underneath. My body measurements are 43\" bust (measured at the fullest part)/ 34\" waist (natural)/44\" hips(fullest). I ordered an XL and it fits well. There is quite a bit of stretch and give to this material, so if you wear a 12 to an 18 like I do depending on the make, brand, and material, the XL will fit you. I also pulled at the waist to see how far it would stretch comfortably. Be aware it not the most forgiving fabric, it will show lumps, bumps, and panty lines. Wear appropriate undergarments, lol! There is no care tag sewn into the skirt and nothing came in the plastic as far as care instructions, but with this type of material I have always machine washed on gentle in cold water, while inside out, and hung to dry, with good results. It keeps my other clithing made from similar material from pilling and looking worn. The stitching and craftsmanship of this skirt are very nice and the fabric seems to be a good quality. I found a tag thanking me for my business and talking about where it is located, etc. Made in the USA, that's a plus! I have been impatiently waiting on this skirt to be delivered ever since the day I ordered it. Lol!\nI received a discount on this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

I would say that it is a little on the smaller side, especially compared to most maxi skirts, so if you are in between sizes you might want to go up. The material is very soft and you can tell that this is made well. One of the things I have had problems with other skirts is that they get a little stretched throughout the day and do not stay on my hips well by the end of the day.

The restrained simplicity of the crescent moon and bright cubic zirconia makes for one of the most elegant ear crawler designs I've ever seen, and the sterling silver ear wires are surprisingly sturdy, while also being ideal for sensitive ears.\n\n Unfortunately,  I'm cursed with uneven piercings, and while ear crawlers have turned out to be a great way to visually even things out, in this particular case, the position of my lowest piercing means that these crawlers won't stay on my earlobe.  The problem is that the hole on one side is very close to the bottom of my earlobe.  Due to the position of the ear wire, which starts at the very end of the crescent, and the curve of the moon shape, I can't get the ear wire to grip enough of my ear to stay in the right position.  Which means that the whole thing slips off and pivots downwards, just like a fish hook or french wire earring.  (In the photos below, I show what it looks like when the earring slips off the ear.)\n\nI have other ear crawlers that work well for me, and the difference is that they have ear wires that start a little more toward the middle of the design.  It's just a fluke that the ear wire here is in just the right position relative to the crescent to slip off, unfortunately. You'll need a lot of earlobe space for these crescents, because they're quite large, measuring 7/8 of an inch from one end of the crescent to the other.\n\nYou can tell they've used good CZs because of the amount of \"fire\" they have---it's actually surprising, considering their small diameter.  These crescents look and feel a lot more expensive than they really are.  They're excellent, and my only regret is that I can't wear the full set myself due to the low piercing on one side---but I'm tempted to mix and match.  Maybe a single CZ stud on one side, and a crawler on the other.\n\n---Promotional sample provided for the purpose of evaluation and objective review.---", "summary": "You'd be a lunatic to not love these moons", "unixReviewTime": 1475366400}

Shipping took much longer than I expected, but once I received it, I have to say- it's great!  The dress itself fits just as I wanted it to, it's not too tight, it's not too loose.  The fabric itself is a black lace cover, and underneath it is a full body polyester (cream colored) slip.  The slip and black lace dress are sewn together.  That slip feels so silky and soft and smooth!  It feels so great against my skin.  The sleeves come down just below my elbows, and the neckline is fairly high.  It's not a terribly revealing dress.  The skirt goes down past the knees, but it raises a lot.  When I move or sit down, it raises up.\n\nThe only thing I say as a caution is that unless you have an amazing body, wear a body shaper under this.  I have some extra weight on me, and every last bit of it shows (even though the dress is loose in some places).  When I tried it on last night, I was a little dismayed by how it looked.  I wore it today with a body shaper and it smoothed and firmed me up- it looked great!  This is a dress you can easily wear to work or for a date or event out.

While I have been on the search for updating, and bettering my wardrobe, due to taking on a more professional level, dresses are becoming essential in my daily life. I have never been a \"dress\" kind of gal, so this is also like a new adventure. Needing a professional dress, but not wanting to pay a couple hundred dollars per dress has also been a challenge of itself. While I can find many in the stores that I really like, I am also not willing to pay that kind of money for something. I would not do that for jeans, shoes, or anything! So finding this brand online here, with a much MUCH cheaper price, and good reviews, I knew I needed to give it a try. It took a very long time to ship, and to get here. They did warn about this, though, so I was alright with it. Once received, it fit absolutely perfectly! Form fitting, but not clingy, the lace detail is very cute and chic. The black color is flat black, and it will literally match anything and everything. The collar is a high scoop-neck, but this helps to ensure the professionalism of it. Overall, it is great material and is constructed very well. I would not run this through the washer or dryer. Dry cleaners will be mandatory, but well worth it for this quality!\n\nI received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.

But alas, once I put it on, I was pleasantly surprised! While the dress is a tiny bit on the large size for me, it's nothing that would prevent me from wearing it. As a matter of fact, I slipped this dress on and fell in love with it!! The fabric is super soft and sleek and forms to your body. It's silky, it's cool, it's non-constricting.  I absolutely love it! The color is gorgeous as well, and absolutely compliments blue eyes. I wash this dress in delicate and then hang dry and it's held together quite nicely.\nOverall, do not judge the garment simply by looking at it...trust me, it looks much better on!

This dress had plenty of room, and it wasn't tight nor clingy. The patterns are light, vibrant, and very retro and stylish. I do recommend wearing this with an undershirt or something sleeveless, just because the back is open. The material feels a little like satin as well. This has quickly become one of my favorites.

He has severe Autism. He is non-verbal, he wanders, he causes self-harm. My little guy needs constant care. But I still want to teach him to be independent. To feel safe at home, we have surveillance cameras in place, dead bolts etc to make sure he stays safe. This GPS was supposed to help with extra safety at home, but also when he goes to school, or when we go to the park, stores, fairs, beach, anywhere. We do not shelter him, we want him to live his life like any other kid his age! I purchased this watch in the hopes of having the GPS function on him at all times, being able to talk to him through the walkie talkie, telling him to come upstairs, telling him I will be there to help in a minute, those types of things. So, I bought this and here is my experience.\nFirst, I ordered Blue and it came in Pink. Contacted support and nothing about replacing the watch because of such a drastic switch in color. I'm sorry, but my kid has it tough enough, now he is supposed to wear a bright pink watch instead of the blue I ordered for him? That is just not right. For such a high price I should get what I ordered.\nSecond, everything is in another language. Everything. I can't make out how to get this working. It is just awful. When I contacted support they helped me download the right app. The app they say to download is the wrong app. So they sent me an email with downloadable instructions. I tried for 5 days straight to try to get it to work. It wouldn't. Battery life ran out super fast and I had to keep charging just to try to get it to work.\nAnyways, I gave everything to my husband to try. I gave up. He is really great with technology. He spent over a week trying to get it to work. He looked up videos, nothing, he tried following the download, nothing worked. It is impossible.\nI would not suggest this product to anyone whether their child needs it because of a serious disability or not.\nI received this watch for a discount for my honest and unbiased opinion.", "summary": "Very unhappy, wrong color, impossible to set up.", "unixReviewTime": 1462665600}

First, it definitely doesn't seem like a cotton blend. It seems like a very silky material, but is probably like polyester and rayon. The sizing is just always goofy with Asian manufacturers. The chart comparison is close, but even so, mine came a bit too large and I'm not sure if I'll even wear it. There's no way this is shrinking and seems like it's not very breathable. Both the body and the sleeves seem longer than a normal US t-shirt would be. It does have an 'athletic' cut/feel to it, but if the sizing is off it won't fit right. I normally wear a Med. to Lg. in US t-shirts, depending on the manufacturer. I used the size chart & got the equivalent of a US large. It feels like a lg. + 1/2. So I either have to gain weight, or wear a thicker shirt under it in order to fill it out.

The bottoms most likely wouldn't even fit my eleven year old daughter and the top was two netting pieces of triangle shaped fabric about 1.5 inches long on each side and were sewn about an inch apart from one another with cheap pieces of ribbon to connect everything. I did receive this product at a discount to review but it wasn't even worth the 4.99 that I paid for it. The \"underwear\" is just same cheap ribbon with a small piece of triangle fabric that would not cover anything and sits at an awkward place. So I have a few pieces of cheap scrap fabric and ribbon that couldn't even be worn if you tried. Honestly the picture is not the same item. There is no way a person with this models build could even get the skirt up let alone be able to get the top to cover both breast and cover them as fully as they are in the picture. Clearly a different item pictured all together. I am still very disgusted by the cheap and pathetic excuse of a set I received.

Not only are they stylish and cute, they also keep me warm in our frigid offices at work. The black one I've had for years has been looking worn and pilled for a while now, so I bought this one online at a discount for my honest and unbiased review to replace it.  Here are my thoughts on this Elain & J Long Sleeve Open Cardigan:\n\nIT'S THIN\nThe material is very thin, much thinner than I expected. If held to the light, it is see-through. This can be a pro or con -- it's doesn't keep me as warm, but then again it's also not too heavy when I just need something light covering me.\n\nTHE TAILS ARE LONG\nThe woman in the model picture must have a very long torso. The longest part (the front) of the garment comes down just a few inches above my knee.  It covers my rear in the back as well. I ordered a small and am 5 feet tall.\n\nIT'S SHEDDING?\nI've only had this cardigan for a few days, but I noticed today that I had tiny black pieces of fabric on my pants.  I rubbed the cardigan in my hands and sure enough, I had a small amount of fabric shedding in my hands. Maybe this goes away after a few washes?\n\nOverall, I like it -- it serves the purpose I need for work and it goes well with everything.  I wish it was a little bit better quality, but I plan to keep wearing it either way.", "summary": "I like it", "unixReviewTime": 1461628800}

This fits perfectly and I couldn't ask for anything more from this swimsuit. The top is darling with the fringe and I love the way it fits  super comfortable and looks awesome on. The bottoms are to die for  and aren't to revealing and aren't covering up everything that I want to tan! I cant wait to wear this in a few days and Im sure Ill be getting all kinds of compliments on it. Id really recommend hand washing this suit and letting it air dry. Im afraid that if I wash it in the washing machine the color will fade  and if I leave it out in the sun to air dry often, that the color might fade  but who knows. The suit seems to be very nicely made and Im super happy that Ill have a suit that no one else will have out on the lake. Im very very happy with my purchase and would encourage others to get this product as well. Definitely a 5 star product in my book! I would highly recommend this to my family and friends hands down!

It is phenomenally better at wicking moisture than some other brands that have \"moisture wicking!!\" plastered all over the place.\n\nGorgeous pattern and colour. And it conceals my under garments!\n\nFabric is comfortable and allows for a lot of movement. As someone who always found spandex as an uncomfortable and restricting material, this is mind blowing.\n\nTrue to size. I'm typically a size 10 and I got the large. Couldn't have nailed it better.\n\nYay! Eco friendly!\n\nI love that you can basically do whatever you want in these!!\n\nCons: but you can't go out in them unless you are petite and/or narrow in the hips. My thighs are 25\" around. They are huge and muscular. My hips are so wide that I still have a thigh gap. That combined with the narrowest gusset I've ever seen = the absolute worst lady lines.\nI don't know if it is a grading issue, if it makes more sense for the smaller sizes, if it would work for narrower or smaller women, but from my perspective, it is so narrow, I don't even know why time was spent incorporating it into the design. I have child sized hands and it is about the size of my thumb. Less than an inch across.\n( but on another note, the gusset IS diamond shaped, so that is a plus )\n\nIt rolls up my thighs and down my hips. A bigger size would be too big, smaller definitely too small. So it probably has more to do with my shape. It is a hassle when doing yoga and any weight training involving squats.\n\nHope that helps!", "summary": "90% perfect!", "unixReviewTime": 1496102400}
