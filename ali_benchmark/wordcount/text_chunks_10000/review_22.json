So I'm picky naturally I'm picky on both ends.\nAnyways, I found it incredibly adorable! A bit heavy, but that's to be expected.\nI honestly though that maybe it wouldn't have nice details, considering I got it for about 2 bucks.\nThey made this piece very cute. However I do see how some would be weary about the gem up top.\nMine was a bit slanted, but since it's so small, you don't really notice it. Even if it came off, I honestly wouldn't care too much.\nThough it would've been nice if they had a color option on the gem, since I would've loved to have my birthstone.\nBut regardless of color options, still cute. And the police box text up top is readable.\n\nIf there's any downsides, it would be the chain. I'm not exactly delicate when wearing things, I'm a tomboy. So when I had tugged once, it came off.\nPut it back together and it came off again not that long after. Honestly I don't care, since the chain can easily be replaced with a better one.\n\nSo overall, I'd recommend this to any Whovian / Doctor Who lover~\nBut if you have neck or hand problems, the weight not be your thing when it comes to jewelry.

First, this item is coming from China. For those who are unhappy with shipping speed, please try to remember that you are only paying $2.21. You can't possibly expect the seller to send this airmail from China so you will get it faster. If he did that, he'd have to charge a lot more for it. You've purchased it for a song, and part of the price for that is that you'll have to wait for it. It probably took mine six weeks to arrive.\n\nThe pendant is very heavy, which immediately made me worry about lead, especially since it was coming from China. I was at the hardware store the day after we got it, so I picked up a lead test kit and swabbed it. The test was negative, so for my pendant at least there was no leachable lead present, at least not at detectible levels. Note that this is not a promise that yours won't be different than the one I received, but I believe mine to be pewter as advertised.\n\nFor $2.21 this is a steal, and worth the wait.

Fits great, snug enough to stay on but still has the bohemian kinda feel- in a good way. I've had it for over a year now and it's held up really well- definitely a well made product with quality material and workmanship. I've washed it a bunch- way more than normal, and pleasantly surprised that it's help up so well and still looks so good. A bit of pilling now but honestly I'd expect it to look a lot worse, with the way it's made its not even noticeable though- which is awesome. The only downside for me was the color was a bit more vibrant than expected, which is why I left off two stars, but make no mistake- this is a really good quality product. I wanted a more neutral color, something I could wear with anything and this wasn't what is hoped.

I went back to my old case since it doesn't make me think my phone is going to fall out any minute.\nUPDATE: I eventually used my dremel tool to cut away the phone case from the 'Pocket' that holds the glasses and epoxyed it to my existing case. Now I have a good phone case with the thinoptics glasses attached. It would be nice if the manufacturer offered just the pocket separately. Not as pretty as I would like but I am into function more than form.", "summary": "Poor Case, Decent Glasses", "unixReviewTime": 1429315200}

The reason I thought that was the perforations are a little off on the angle, so not perpendicular, and about an inch, inch and a half down from the bottom edge of the binding.  So where one would normally expect to tear a piece of paper off in a nice neat line, this pad will be ragged as hell, crooked and about an inch, inch and a half down from where you would expect.

Bought the lighter brown version and it's a beautiful, deep, rich, British tan color.  Leather quality is better than expected.  Soft, smooth, and shimmering, with light grain and creasing.  Some negative reviews claim it's not real leather.  It's possible it isn't 100% leather throughout (I don't know), but the cover and the interior lining do look, feel, and smell like the real deal. The issue may be the leather seems thin, which makes the portfolio relatively light and the interior pocket a bit flimsy.  It doesn't have the heft or rugged look some expect from  leather.  But that can also be said of more refined leather goods that are more delicate than bulky. So not necessarily a bad thing, really just expectations.  And despite another review's claim, there is a 100% genuine leather tag in the inseam of the inner pocket.\n\nWhat's bad...\n\nIt's smaller than other portfolios.  For reference, within the zippered area there's maybe half an inch of perimeter space around a standard 8.5 x 11 paper pad.  Other's may have an inch or more and could fit all sorts of stuff, but this works fine for notes, standard documents and files.  Size may be an issue when trying to squeeze something larger in there (like a small laptop).\n\nOverall...\nI'm happy with the purchase.  Especially around this price point, most other options seem to be \"PU\" and \"pleather,\" so a leather product, whatever the quality, seems like a reasonable value.

There is a great variety of colors, great for both boys and girls! I am impressed with these and I'm sure they will be a big hit! The size seems perfect for my 8 year old son, and the bracelets are adjustable, so they will fit adults too.  I also wanted to add that these bracelets seem to be reversible as either side has a really nice pattern choice (I included a picture so you can see both sides!)  Lastly, I procrastinate sometimes and I ordered these on June 14th at around 1 pm eastern time and paid for expedited shipping.  I chose Tranquility Floral as my seller because their expedited shipping price was the most reasonable.

Also, the charms are made of two layers of metal that are affixed together. It's not just one solid piece of metal. So sometimes they aren't perfectly lined up and they have a seem at the side that makes them look even cheaper than they cost.

I have always loved cable knit sweaters, but I do wish this had cables on both front AND back.\nOne last thing- I've seen so many comments on how the ladies don't like the cuffed sleeve, which I understand. As a result of the cuffed sleeve, many are saying the sleeves are too short, the sweater doesn't fit correctly, etc, etc. I have a small suggestion that's super easy to do. If you're able to partially unroll the cuff to the point that you can see where and how it's sewn up you'll notice that it's one single thread running back and forth, and that's it. If you snip the thread in a few places it'll completely come out, and then the sleeve will uncuff. There you have it. No more cuff. No more short sleeves.

Style-wise it is on point. I love the fake leather buttons, patch pockets and thickness of the sweater. Its acrylic, but a modern acrylic, not scratchy at a all. A great wool alternative.\nThe downsides are poor workmanship. The pockets aren't trimmed out and have large seams that are bulky. One of mine was trimmed a little and the other not at all. One sleeve had a large curve in the stitching which made the inside arm stick out very noticeably. All the seams are sewn to the end of the hems, and not before the cuff and waistband start. It looks altered and not flat.\nThose reviews that say the sleeve is short, well it is. BUT it is a drop shoulder seam. If the sleeve was longer, as you wore the sweater the sleeve would cover your hand. If it really is too short for you, unfortunately you can't take down the cuff because it is sewn in one seam.\nSize wise, if you are between sizes I would go down a size. It is a pretty open weave and will stretch as you wear it. I am on the curvier hip side, and I could  have easily gone down a size without worry so the bust would have fit better.\nIt comes from England, so expect it to arrive in about 10 days.\nAll in all, I am ok with this purchase, because I didn't pay that much.", "summary": "Sewing flaws, but style and price win out.", "unixReviewTime": 1425427200}

These pants are kind of like an SUV - they look manly, but you shouldn't try to actually do anything manly in them.\n\nThe polyester helps make them a bit cooler than other rugged-type pants that I own.

These fit perfectly fine. I think they'll still fit OK if I were 10 lbs lighter because I am certainly benefiting from the stretch in the waistband.\n\nThe color is \"navy.\" I think of this color as air force blue or cop blue. If you've spent time around those uniforms then you know exactly what I mean.\n\nThe build quality is pretty good. There were a few threads that needed trimmed, no big deal - see comments on uniforms above. An annoyance, easily solved, is that there was a sizing tag sewn into the outside seam of the waistband. I'd rather not have had to risk cutting or tearing stitches when removing it. The cloth itself is thick and a bit coarse to the touch. It feels like it can take some abuse. The cloth is doubled at the knees, which is nice because it gives a smidgen of padding. These pants have all the usual pockets plus a few \"tactical\" pockets on the legs.

Even after the party, I'm planning on wearing the dress once summer comes back around as I love dressing up in cute lolita-like dresses, and this dress is perfectly acceptable to just wear around in public. Sadly, I took off one star as the collar is quite tight around my neck and I always have that faint sensation of choking every time I wear it. It's not unbearable, just sort of uncomfortable.

We live in CA so the weather here is far from frigid but keeps my baby warm enough for our winters here. My baby is 26lbs and 32\" tall and the medium is big on him but not too big to where it poses a problem, he just has room to grow. He still is able to stand and move around freely and the legs stay on the ankle, never falls down which is nice. However if you wanted to pull the legs over the feet for extra warmth, you can do that too. I only give 4 stars because once it's zipped up to the top, the fabric flap that covers it is small and bulky but doesn't seem to bother my baby as he sleeps and he mostly sleeps on his stomach. The zipper is fully covered though and doesn't scratch at all.

It's really well made and the paneled stitching in the front is done very well. I like how they did it in black to give it a nice bold two tone look. The two zippers alongside the paneled stitching are both functional but are really there as a fashionable accent.\n\nIt comes with a detachable strap which is nice for when your bag is heavy with stuff and you want to throw it over you like a cross body bag. It can be used as a handbag or a shoulder bag.\n\nThe inside is pretty standard like most handbags with 1 side zipper, 1 middle zipper which can help divide surrounding stuff you may have in this bag, and 2 side pockets. The side pockets are a little bit on the small side which can make for a tight fit if you have a newer smart phone.\n\nThe care instructions state \"Do not expose to rain and sun.\" So this bag is probably not going to get much use in the winter time.

Johnson", "reviewText": "This is a nice purse to take to meetings, lectures, etc because it is reminiscent of a briefcase and you can easily put tablets, folders and notebooks inside, (It is more of a stiff-sided bag rather than a floppy one.) It's a great size for everyday carrying, not too big that it becomes cumbersome to carry and not too small that you can't fit anything in it. The color of the \"brown\" purse is more like a cognac color, more on the orange side of brown. It includes a shoulder strap that you can use instead of the carrying handles, which is a nice option. As any nice purse it came with a dust cover and each handle was protectively wrapped in plastic and the feet were covered in tape to prevent scratches. Those attentions to detail are all signs of good quality. The zippers on the front are decoration only, they provide a nice detail but do not open up to expand the bag or have secret pockets. Every other zipper is functional. The liner is a durable dark brown and is a good color and material for keeping the bag looking nice inside (easy to clean, dark enough to not show stains.)  I do not know if this is actual leather, it feels like vinyl, but it is still attractive and nice-looking. The stitching is pretty good (about 98% perfect) and any flaw I noticed was only detected because I looked extremely carefully at it, definitely not noticeable unless you are looking for it. The black edging is done well, they did a very good job on it. It is comfortable to carry and looks smart, I look forward to seeing more from this company. I am pretty picky when it comes to my handbags and I am looking forward to using this one, especially with the \"patchwork\" trend being on point this season.\n(This sample was provided for testing and review purposes.)", "summary": "Pretty and useful cognac-colored bag", "unixReviewTime": 1428883200}

The clear slide on part is useful for carrying cash and other cards. I can fit more than 10 bills inside easily plus an insurance card. It is also removable so you can just carry the metal cardslide itself if you want. It looks like it should last a long time and the mechanism to push the cards out works very well. You can see them fan out really nicely while being held on tightly so that nothing falls out. I have not tried out the RFID blocking capability yet.\n\nOne thing to note is that the paint can chip off (1 star off), I had my keys in the same pocket as the wallet and can see a slight chip. Not too big of a deal, but it can happen. I also bought the red band for a different look as seen in the picture. I hope to use this for a long time.

The card eject mechanism works well, and it feels nice in the hand.\n\nSize for just the Cardprotector is great. I could probably even sit on it without much discomfort. The addition of the Cardslide makes the unit about as bulky as a leather trifold, without the \"give\" a flexible wallet provides. So leaving it in your back pocket is not comfortable for driving or working at the office.\n\nIf you plan to carry it in a front pocket, I don't think it would be as much of a problem, depending on how tight your skinny jeans fit. I keep my phone in my front pocket, so keeping the wallet in my left front would be awkward for me.\n\nI have an NFC type parking pass, and since the aluminum Cardprotector is rated to protect against information theft, I tried to keep the parking pass in the plastic Cardslide.\n\nApparently the signal has some trouble escaping even the plastic, as I have to hold up my parking pass for an awkward amount of time, before the gate rises so I can enter the garage.\n\nI just recently tried holding my parking pass to the exterior on the other side of the wallet, so just the elastic band touches the card, and the parking card is not inside of the unit at all. (See photo)\n\nSo far, even this does not trigger the gate to rise as fast as holding just the card up to the reader. I don't know if the aluminum is somehow disrupting the signal from my parking pass, or what.\n\nI hope to find a solution, because I'd like to keep my parking pass with my wallet, so I can swap between driving my truck and my motorcycle to work, without worrying about if I left my parking pass with the other vehicle.\n\nOverall, a cool product. I hope to figure out a solution to my issue, so I can use the Cardprotector for years to come.\n\n(I assume within 3-5 years we won't need wallets at all.)\n\nThough I will probably ditch the plastic slide, and just use the Cardprotector by itself, to save on bulk in my pocket.\n\nI recommend getting one, but see if you can pare down to just the Cardprotector before spending the extra money on the Cardslide version.\n\nUPDATE: I made room for my parking pass inside the Cardprotector. I positioned it so the parking pass was the tallest card in the stack when the cards were ejected. That worked very well when exiting the garage yesterday.\n\nTIP: If you stack two embossed cards (raised numbers) facing each other so the numbers don't cause any extra thickness,  you can get an extra card in the Cardprotector.", "summary": "Outstanding, if you do not keep it in a back pocket when seated.", "unixReviewTime": 1426809600}

I can comfortably fit two sets of keys, one phone, one big wallet, one cosmetic case, my sunglasses and regular glasses.  Still room to put in small purchases or notebooks as examples.  Watch out though because they do sell a bigger one and I saw that at a Vera Bradley store and it was huge--I am reasonably tall and I would have hesitation on that.

I actually had to use it as a carry on on my way home and was so glad I bought it!!!  Only thing I would like would be to add an outside pocket to it for pens or lipgloss :)", "summary": "Great bag!!  Not quilted...", "unixReviewTime": 1468454400}

It's absolutely gorgeous and well-made -- great Vera Bradley quality.  I used this on a recent trip to Italy and it was fantastic.

Then, on the way back, I also used it as a carry on, but had it expanded with lots of great souvenirs from my trip.

I have to say first that the pendant is larger than I thought that it would be, but that is not a bad thing. I love that the pearl is set out from the pendant part of the necklace gives it a little more pizazz. This necklace is so beautiful the pictures do not do it justice.\n\nNow let me talk Style 4. This is my favorite it is just beautiful! I love the flowers on it. I also love how the flowers make a horseshoe shape.

You see, as a young man he and his virility traveled the perilous road of amore. When you travel such a road, you need to think about protection and Im not talking about latex. What I speak of is known as the cornicello or little bull horn. When you have had as many spurned lovers as Uncle Alfredo, you most definitely need to wear one to ward off the evil eye.\n\nI was hoping to get a necklace with a 3 inch cornicello so I can display my virility to the world while protecting myself from the evil eye. My wife had other ideas so what I got instead, free in exchange for this unbiased review, is the Bamoer cubic zirconia white Gold plated round halo pendant necklace.\n\nWhen I first saw this necklace, I knew my wife would love it. My wife prefers small dainty jewelry and, as I predicted, she loves this necklace.\n\nThe circular pendant is beautiful with a very classy looking design making it perfect for that big night out. It also looks great with jeans and a sweater so it works for more casual outings as well. The stones maybe cubic zirconia but they have nice clarity and really sparkle.\n\nThe only negative thing I found with the necklace is the chain. It seems a little too delicate to me and seems to be prone to knotting. It isn't a big deal to my wife though. She says these are the types of chains you get in this price range and the knots are easy to undo so that is not an issue for her.\n\nIf you are in the market for inexpensive jewelry, you can't go wrong with this necklace.

However, vendors should actually post pics of what they are TRULY-selling.  Come on guys near and abroad--let's keep the selling points clean and straightforward in an effort to get positive reviews...all the TIME!! I give the fit 4 stars for not sending me the exact replica as advertised in the photo. Perfect Fit!", "summary": "\"Goddesses Only\"!!", "unixReviewTime": 1441929600}

I owned one once before from Tommy Hilfiger and it was complete crap. Never worked even after replacing the battery on it twice so I assumed I was out of luck until I saw this one. Gotta say I love the watch...I had the same issue as others mentioned where the watch was 15 mins delayed but after letting the radio signal do its thing, it updated in 24 hours. I left it face down next to a window at night per instructions. They mention night is the best time to update because there is less interference and since I'm up all night anyway these days I did a couple of manual tries and I got it.

I've never bought one before, so for my waist size (39\") I decided to play it safe and get the 36\". I plan on purchasing the 32\" version in a few weeks.\n\nIt fits perfectly, and after only a few days of wearing it I am able to tighten it all the way. I've worn it 4-8 hours every day since it arrived (7 days so far) and can already see a difference in the size/shape of my natural waist and tummy.\n\nThe corset itself has a beautiful design, is very sturdy, and all of the boning is steel. I've seen reviews of other corsets that are listed as steel boning but only have it in the front with the rest being made from plastic or other flimsy, bendable material. So I was relieved to find that mine came as advertised. The strings are made from a thick, shoe string-like material that is very sturdy. I can pull on them really hard and tight without fear of breaking.\n\nIt's really very comfortable once you get used to wearing it and figure out how to move in it. You won't be able to bend at the waist, as is expected, but it's not impossible or awkward to pick things up off the floor. It helps with posture training as well, which is great for a sloucher like me.\n\nAnother bonus is that it looks freaking SEXY! I won't go into detail, but I will say that my husband absolutely loves it. It even looks amazing under clothing. I wore it under a tight fitting shirt to work yesterday, and it's very discreet and unnoticeable. I received compliments from co-workers and customers, most of them saying, \"That shirt looks amazing on you!\" They had no idea that it wasn't just my choice in clothing making me look good.\n\nTL;DR version: In short, I love this corset. It's gorgeous, comfortable, and discreet. It's perfect for waist training, wearing under clothing, and for costumes. It's amazing, and I highly recommend it.", "summary": "Gorgeous, comfortable, and discreet", "unixReviewTime": 1422489600}

It is not. I ordered a size large in order to ensure it would fit my 36C bust and it fits slightly loose. A medium would probably fit but be slightly tight. It measures similarly to flowy camis I have in size L or XL. I'd recommend ordering based on your normal size taking bust into consideration.\n\nOtherwise, I think the garment is decent quality for the price. The hem and sticking aren't perfect but it doesn't seem like it's in jeopardy of falling apart. I will probably hand wash or throw it in the wash with my delicates. It's semi-sheer. I tried on the pink top with a black bra and the outline was vaguely visible but not so see-through that it looks trashy. A nude or pink bra should work fine. The cami is slightly cropped but meets my waist (and I'm 5'9\").\n\nOverall, if you'd like to have a fashionable top for the right price, I'd recommend it.

Here are the issues:\n\n1) the sizing chart is somewhat inaccurate.  I wear a Juniors size 9 typically, or a women size 8.  I ordered a size medium.  While I was able to button them, it was tough.  It was just too small in the waist, and the pant length was a tad to short.  It caused the \"its one size too small muffin top\" making it rather uncomfortable to bend or sit.\n\n2) they are labeled as Dry Clean only on the tag, and when i bought them the amazon description said hand wash.\n\nAlso just a general note.  These ship from China directly.  They showed up about a week and a half after I ordered them which was awesome, but that is why the shipping is so much,\n\nSeller note:  the seller is awesome.  I contacted them via amazon about the sizing issue and they got back to me right away requesting measurements to make sure they get the right size if I was interested in getting some larger ones.\n\nI would definitely get these again, and I would definitely order from this seller again.

I like the design it has and this seller has a lot of neat pocket squares to choose from. I ordered this one as my first purchase to see if I would like it before I ordered more, so yes, I will order others from them. That being said there are a couple things to keep in mind. The pictures that they use are more vibrant than the actual product, in this one the orange and dark blue are much more vibrant in the pictures than the product I received, never the less.. I still like it. When I took a picture of it with my iphone, guess what.. The colors really popped out like the sellers picture. I think the seller does the best job he can representing the product with the amount of pictures and close ups as possible. Also, as some others have stated the material is thicker compared to the usual thin silk pocket square you may be accustomed to. A thinner pocket square with a design in it may have the design in it from silk screen or some other form of design printing, this is more of a tapestry. The gold outline you see everywhere is gold thread. The variation between the dark blue, the light blue and the orange are very nice. Being that it is thicker it's not the best if you prefer the \"stuff it\" style of a pocket square, but if you do a traditional fold style it will work great because the stiffness of the fabric with hold shape better, at the same time it's not so thick that it's unmanageable. I like it and I will be ordering others. I prefer the thinner silk style of pocket squares but these designs are so nice that I don't mind.\n  The Shipping: I ordered this on August 10th and it arrived on August 17th. When I ordered, amazon said it would arrive sometime in the middle of September because it was coming from China so it was a nice surprise when it arrived just 6 days after I purchased.

Fluff air - NO HEAT and not for very long. This made it look a lot more fluffy! The zippered pocket is a nice touch, but my iPhone 6s will NOT fit in it, the top of my phone peeks out about an inch. But I can fit a pack of gum and some money and a credit card in there. The underside of the hat is super soft and comfortable, and very warm. I have a really small head and it's a tad big over my forehead and eyes but again, not a huge deal. The paws hang down to about the tops of my thighs, I'm 5'1\".

Some people have complained that the glow-in-the-dark material is simply a smattering of paint, but I see no problem with that. It's solid and it doesn't come off. Sure, it doesn't look terribly attractive, but it glows nicely, so we're happy. This is a very low-priced item, after all. I ordered this on the 10th of last month and it arrived on the 28th, which was 9 days before the earliest projected delivery date. I feel that the seller made pretty good time, given that it was delivered from China. In my experience, jewelry coming from China takes an average of 20 days to arrive (for future reference). All in all, I am very satisfied with my purchase, and I would recommend this as a gift for anyone.\n\nNote: my sister's head is approximately 20\" in circumference, and the chain fit easily over her head with plenty of room to spare.

The sleeves and hood are a light weight sweat shirt material and the body is light weight denim. Perfect for cool fall days! I'm a little confused about sizing but the product I ordered fit nicely. Others mentioned the buttons being noisey and while they do seem a little loose, they are not loud or distracting at all. The only issue I found was the sizing. I ordered a small and that was what was marked on the packaging, however the product itself had a tag labeled XXL. The product fit as expected, like an adult small but I have to wonder what you would receive if you ordered a larger size. I am aware that asian sizes are smaller so maybe the company sent the size that corresponds to US adult small. The product came quickly and I would definitely order again.

Just be warned though, if you are a thick girl, you'll be in the same place I am...\n\nThe socks fit fine, though a little tight on my thick thighs. That's okay though, at least they won't fall down easily lol\n\nSo all in all: Cute outfit. Decently made. Is it designer quality? Pffft nah! If you're expecting a true quality school girl outfit, go buy a $100 cosplay outfit on Ebay or something. :P It's definitely NOT one size fits most.

He's a big anime nerd, so I figured this would be perfect for surprising him. I read the reviews, and saw many saying the skirt runs small. Now, I'm a large normally. So, I figured ordering a 3X would be safe. That skirt is not no 3x. It's not even a large. The skirt I was sent looks more like a small. It would have fit me prepregnancy just perfectly, which was about twenty pounds ago. I could not get it around my waist. I have to pull it to my belly button for it to fit, and then it doesn't cover my butt. I guess that's perfect for bedroom wear, but definitely could not use it outside the bedroom. Even so, I was disappointed. The shirt fit perfectly, so I was confused why there was such a size difference there. It's like it was made for someone who's 120 lbs with DD breasts... The socks were a perfect fit, too. I'll probably end up just buying a different skirt to pair with it. A black one would match the socks. Be warned: If you have wide hips like I do, the skirt probably will not fit you. This outfit is made for people who aren't built like Jessica Rabbit. Don't feel bad if you order a really big size and it doesn't fit. The sizing on this one is WAY off.

I don't have any problems with the color, I love purple and it goes well with my complexion.  Ruffles aren't necessarily my favorite, but these are done well enough to where I don't mind wearing them.\n\nMy trouble with this shirt is that it makes me look pregnant.  Ok, so I'm short, and there's not a lot of space between my bust and my backside, so while I have a flat enough tummy and even some decent enough ab definition, you totally can't tell in this shirt. It pooches out because of the flouncing in just the right spot. It's something I'm not particularly fond of.  Now I don't necessarily like to wear very fitted shirts either, so it' not the looseness that bothers me, it's the fact that I think it makes me look puffy in the middle.  Now I did ask a member of my son's therapy team, and she totally thinks it's in my head.  But then, if you feel like something makes you look bloated it doesn't necessarily matter as much how other people see it, because part of you is still uncomfortable anyways.\n\nSo this is something that could work for you or against you.  If you actually are pregnant, and aren't wanting anyone to know yet...great shirt for that, totally great.  If you aren't pregnant and don't want to look it...well, that one could be in the eye of the beholder.  Otherwise, there's nothing technically wrong with this shirt that I can see, and everybody assures me it's pretty on me.

It is so feminine.  Its so comfortable to wear.\nThis is something I see myself wearing a lot.\n\nSizing:\nWhen I ordered this blouse, I ordered a size larger based on old reviews.\nI wish I had read the listing better, because the seller went back to the\nmanufacture and had them fix the size issue.  So when I received this\nitem it is a little bit big on me.  I plan on making it work just the same.\n\nStyle:\nThis blouse is high on style.  It has several notable design elements to\nit.  First, this a pull over blouse.  There is no zippers or closures.\nIt has a round neckline accented with a double ruffle made from\npleated chiffon.  The neckline is further embellished with two fabric\nflowers and a cascade ruffle.  The front of the blouse has large pleats\ncoming down the front and a banded waist band.  The sleeves are\nlong and made from the pleated chiffon.  Each sleeve is accented\nwith a cuff at the wrist.\n\nFabric:\nThe fabric this blouse is made of is absolutely gorgeous.  The\nchiffon and pleated chiffon are made of polyester.  The lining and\nback of the blouse are made of a cotton knit.\nFabric care for this blouse is hand wash in a woolite like product and\nlay flat to dry.  Alternatively, professionally cleaned at a dry cleaner\nwould work as well.\n\nThis blouse is well constructed.  The best way to tell if a top\nis well made is to turn it wrong side out and look at the seams.\nThe seams on this blouse have all been surged to keep the chiffon\nfrom freying.  All the seems are straight.  No loose threads could be\nfound.\n\nThis blouse is perfect for almost any occasion.  I intend to use it as a\nwork blouse.  Because of its modest styling, you could wear it to church,\ndinner out, special events or a party.  Depending on how you pare this\nblouse, you can wear it dressy or casual.\n\nI have a grey skirt that I have been dying to wear.  This blouse will look great\nwith it.  Also, it will look awesome with a pair of white or black dress pants.\n\nThis is such a beautiful blouse.  I can't wait to start wearing it.\n\nSample received for a fair and honest evaluation.  I found that this item matched\nthe description accurately on the listing page.  This review is my honest opinion\nbased on my personal experience using this product.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"/C2U-Women-Pullover-Elegant-Wave-Flouncing-Long-Sleeve-Chiffon-Shirt-Purple-XL/dp/B00PDK9IR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">C2U Women Pullover Elegant Wave Flouncing Long Sleeve Chiffon Shirt,Purple XL</a>", "summary": "I love the  beautiful details on this blouse", "unixReviewTime": 1465171200}

The color, the pattern, everything. The top is a spandex-y top with chiffon sleeves and a loose chiffon layer over the front. This top layer is great at hiding some of the flaws that a larger person like myself has. I wear a 16W from Target and Kohl's. Based on their size chart, I knew that this would run on the slightly smaller side than I'm used to, but decided to try it anyway. If it wasn't for the loose chiffon layer, I probably wouldn't like it as much. I wore this and felt incredible. I did receive a lot of positive feedback, but I'd wear it again even if no one else liked it because *I* like it that much. Whenever I see that rich purple color, it makes me happy. I'm so glad I took the chance and bought it, despite the sizing chart being 1/2-1\" smaller than I normally go for. (I bought the largest size available).\n\nAs you can see, I paired it with a black cardigan, and also black pants. The photo has a more yellow tint to it than IRL. The color matched exactly what I thought it would based on the photo - but do take into account your own monitor and how it has matched color expectations in the past. The top is absolutely work appropriate and only the sleeves are see-through. I'm 5/7 and it hit me around my hips.

I mean come on how good can they be at this price? Well they are no designer boots but they are definitely cute and fit just fine. About the same quality you would get from Target but at an extremely reasonable price. I could get 3 pairs of these for the price of 1 from Target. So kind of a no brainer here.  I would give 5 stars but there are just a couple little things that bug me slightly. The shape over the top of the foot is a little odd, shaped more like a slipper boot but not too obvious unless they are in your face. However that does give more room for a thicker sock with out cutting off your circulation. They do have nice toe room. I am borderline needing wide width, depending on the brand but most medium width fit fine. They could use a little more cushion in the sole but they are not uncomfortable at all. Would be fine for going out or shopping. Can't say I would wear them if I had to stand and walk all day just because there is very little shock absorption or cushion. Overall I'm impressed. Usually u get what you pay for but for $10 a pop, these boots can not be beat. I'm ordering a few more colors and checking out some other styles. I can now afford to have a different pair of boots for everyday of the week! Thanks!", "summary": "Exceeded my expectations!", "unixReviewTime": 1471392000}

I received it fast and none of the gems were loose.  I did remove the green beaded part, as I didn't like the fact that it didn't match the pretty pastel green gems.  I thought it looked out of place.  It was easy to remove and I'm much happier with just the gold chain accenting the necklace.  The gems were glued a bit off center but not really noticeable and no problem considering it was such a good price.  The necklace is metal, not plastic so it has some weight to it which is nice.  If you were to buy this piece at a specialty store it would cost at least close to 40 dollars at minimum.  I am very pleased.\n\nI feel I need to revise this review.  Since the above review, I have ordered three more necklaces as gifts, all in the white and cream color.  One shipment of two, then again I ordered a third.  Each necklace came slightly broken.  However I was able to fix each necklace with either pliers or a hot glue gun.  I think the packaging and shipment is to blame.  The necklace is bounced around all the way from China.  Clearly I didn't find this minor fixes an issue since I kept ordering them.  If you are prepared to fix the minor issues it's still a great necklace.", "summary": "This necklace is quite pretty.

For the price it is okay if your looking for something like this. Especially since shipping is free. But I would suggest just spending the extra $10 and buying a necklace like this at your local cheap fashion store or at Walmart, whose fashion jewlery is much better made. If the product was heavier I would have recieced this with a better attitude because seriously, even though I bought it for cheap, one wrong move and this necklace will break, which is a waste of $4 to me. $4 I would have spent on a shirt that would last longer.", "summary": "It's okay", "unixReviewTime": 1428969600}

It's a smaller gauge than the others, and I'm sure they intend it as a FEATURE: a stopper that prevents the beads from falling off when you open the clasp, But that means you cannot customize the bracelet, which was my intent when I bought it. I intended to remove many of the silver beads.\n\nI've tried to pull off this extra bead, to unscrew it over the end of the bracelet, and to unscrew the end of the bracelet itself, all no luck. The chain itself looks very nice and sturdy, so I'd hate to destroy it just so I can liberate the beads. But the bracelet is heavy (44 g or 1.55 oz) and more ornate than I want. <sigh>\n\nArrow in photo points to the extra bead.\n---------\nUpdated: FINALLY got the stopper bead OFF! I wiggled/screwed it ONTO the end piece of the bracelet, and then watched from where the end piece is attached to the bracelet, to align the bead hole with the back edge of the end piece.\n\nAlso wanted to share that 3 of the beads are shiny/plain on half their surface.

I like that you can add the chain or use the strap. The length of the strap is adjustable. This is a medium/small bag, perfect to throw over your shoulder. In it I can carry everything I need (phone/wallet, keys, pens, makeup/sanitary items, medicine) plus a medium sized book and a bottle of water, but beyond that this is not a huge purse and will not hold school books or anything like that. It has two flaps pictured on the front, each opening up to a slot with the front being smaller and flatter and the back being the bulk of the storage space. This may seem obvious but the circle (sequins?) hanging off the front of the bag do make noise, and it is noticeable. I figured that may be the case before I bought the bag, and the sound isn't unpleasant. Everyone says it sounds like a bellydancer, if that makes sense. I bring that up because at times I wish I could make it be quiet. For instance, this may not be a purse you'd bring to a library as I'm sure you'd draw attention with the sound, and you may not want to bring this bag to class if you tend to be late.

What I can tell you is these are a great deal for the price and the shoe itself is comparable to Shimano shoes around the $100+/- price point (entry to low intermediate).  The pedals can be rebuilt and after disassembly and examination, they are comparable to SPDs in the $40 - $50 range.  (Both price points above are online from major outlets, not from a brick and mortar shop which would be slightly higher).\n\nI took these out on a couple of trail parks in my area and they performed as expected.  They are more than reasonably comfortable, but you do need to order 1/2 to 1 size smaller.  I am just short of a US 11 and the 44.5 fits great with no socks or typical foot socks. (see pics)  I live in florida, so thicker socks are never used.\n\nHere is the rundown:\n\nApplication:  This is a race type MTB shoe.  However, the soles are not quite as stiff as my Shimano shoes had.  Considering I am no longer racing, but riding for pleasure, this is fine and actually makes the shoes a little easier to walk in, not much, but a little.  This is handy since I do a lot of riding at MTB parks where there are stop/rest areas and picnic tables near technical parts and places to get off and rest.  If you are looking for a hard core race shoe, this might not be the shoe for you. Then again, you wouldn't be looking at anything under $225 if you are.\n\nWeight/Construction:  The weight of the shoe is a little less or the same as some of my other shoes.  This is likely due to having less tread on the bottom.  This might effect the longevity of the shoe sole with excessive walking, but primarily in the heel area.  The synthetic materials are sturdy and well stitched.  The breathable mesh is comparable to other shoes, but I would say the synthetic leather and strap backings are a slightly thinner gauge.  Not enough that I would be too concerned unless you fall a lot or hit a bunch of stuff with your feet on the trails... But then again, any shoe is going to suffer to some degree.\n\nPedals: I installed them on a second bike and I have my vintage Shimano SPD-M737s on my primary bike.  Stock, mine were adjusted Med - Med/light tension and very close to where I have my 737s set. They have a slightly smaller platform which I am not use to, but as far as the actual binding actuators go, they perform like the 737s.\n\nCleats:  Again, as expected.  If you do a lot of walking or have to get off on rocky sections, chances are you will give them some abuse.  I have broken Shimano cleats in the past and I always carry an extra set.\n\nA word to the wise:  If these are your first clipless pedals, and you are handy with an allen wrench and have some basic mechanical skills, you can likely set these up yourself. If not, go to a shop and let them install and fit you up.  If you DIY, just make sure you take your tools with you on your first couple of rides. Getting them adjusted at home may reveal some need for adjustments once you actually hit the trail.  Just make sure you ride trails with a variety of technical terrain that you regularly ride.\n\nThere are no directions, but you can youtube or google MTB SPD pedal setup and find loads of info.  Regardless of the brand, the setup is roughly the same. Just make sure if you adjust the tension on your pedals, adjust equally for both pedal sides. Count your turns and go in small increments.\n\nHappy riding and stay safe on the trails!", "summary": "Very good value for entry level race type SPD clipless setup", "unixReviewTime": 1464825600}
