Here there are two applications in which we use Monte Carlo Methods to make computations with big amount of random data. And we make use of Cloud Functions using Lithops here. These applications show how these complex mathematical and random computations can be made easily and effortlessly with Lithops.

##  What is Monte Carlo Method?
Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches. Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three problem classes: optimization, numerical integration, and generating draws from a probability distribution.
